Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On April 22, 2005, MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and MetLife Funding, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Funding," and together with the Company, the "Borrowers"), entered into a Five-Year $1,500,000,000 Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among the Borrowers, a group of banks as lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-documentation agents, and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Banc of America Securities, LLC as joint lead arrangers and book managers. The proceeds of the Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes and to support the Borrowers' commercial paper programs. All borrowings must be repaid by April 22, 2010, except that letters of credit outstanding on that date may remain outstanding until April 22, 2011. This Credit Agreement replaces a $1 billion credit agreement expiring in 2005. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type, including a requirement that the Company represent that no "default," as defined in the Credit Agreement, has occurred and is continuing at the time of a new borrowing under the Credit Agreement. The amount available under the Credit Agreement may be increased to a maximum amount of $2,000,000,000, provided that no "event of default," as defined in the Credit Agreement, has occurred and is continuing. The Company is required to maintain a consolidated net worth of $15 billion, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, must maintain adjusted statutory surplus of $7.75 billion. Amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon an event of default, such as a breach of a representation or covenant or the occurrence of bankruptcy, if not otherwise waived or cured. On April 25, 2005, the Company entered into a $2,000,000,000 Amended and Restated Five-Year Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (the "L/C Agreement"), among the Company, The Travelers Life and Annuity Reinsurance Company, a South Carolina corporation ("TLARC"), a group of banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders as lenders, Citibank, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, National Association ("Wachovia"), as co-administrative agents, Wachovia, as paying agent, BNP Paribas and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc, as co-syndication agents, Danske Bank A/G, as documentation agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. Under the L/C Agreement, the Company agreed to unconditionally guarantee TLARC's reimbursement obligations with respect to reinsurance letters of credit issued pursuant to the L/C Agreement. The L/C Agreement amends an agreement under which Citigroup Insurance Holding Company, the parent company of TLARC, is the guarantor of TLARC's reimbursement obligations, but the Company does not replace Citigroup Insurance Holding Company as guarantor, and letters of credit continue to be issued under the existing unamended agreement, until the closing of the acquisition by the Company of TLARC and certain of its affiliates. The Agreement expires five years after that closing. Borrowings under the L/C Agreement are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type, including a requirement that the Company represent that no "default" or "event of default," each as defined in the L/C Agreement, has occurred and is continuing at the time of a new borrowing under the L/C Agreement. The Company is required to maintain a consolidated net worth of $15 billion, and The Travelers Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup Insurance Holding Company, is required to maintain a risk based capital ratio of 2.5 to 1. Amounts due under the L/C Agreement may be accelerated upon an event of default, such as a breach of a representation or covenant or the occurrence of bankruptcy, if not otherwise waived or cured. The lenders and the agents (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) under the Credit Agreement and L/C Agreement have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust and other advisory services to the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, for such services.

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (a) references to agreements (including the Loan Documents) and other contractual instruments shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications thereto, but only to the extent that such amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications are not prohibited by any Loan Document; and (b) references to any Law shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending, replacing, supplementing or interpreting such Law. 1.06 TIMES OF DAY. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable). 1.07 LETTER OF CREDIT AMOUNTS. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to mean the maximum face amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all increases thereof that occur without amendment as the result of the occurrence of a date, the passage of time or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event, as expressly set forth in such Letter of Credit or the Issuer Documents related thereto, whether or not such maximum face amount is in effect at such time. 19 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
ARTICLE II. THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS 2.01 COMMITTED LOANS. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Committed Loan") to the Borrowers from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Committed Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, any Borrower or all Borrowers may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Committed Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein. The obligations of the Borrowers to repay Loans and L/C Obligations shall be several, not joint. 2.02 BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF COMMITTED LOANS. (a) Each Committed Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be made upon a Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans to Base Rate Committed Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans. Each telephonic notice by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of a Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Section 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) which Borrower is borrowing the Committed Borrowing, (ii) whether a Borrower is requesting a Committed Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans, (iii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iv) the principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (v) the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, and (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If a Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if a Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans. If a Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed 20 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding Subsection. In the case of a Committed Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. As promptly as practicable, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 5.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the applicable Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the applicable Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by a Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings of such Borrower outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to such Borrower as provided above. (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders. (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. (e) After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed Loans of the same Type, there shall not at any one time be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans. 2.03 BID LOANS. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees that any Borrower or all Borrowers may from time to time request the Lenders to submit offers to make loans (each such loan, a "Bid Loan") to any Borrower or all Borrowers prior to the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.03; provided, however, that after giving effect to any 21 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Bid Borrowing, the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments. There shall not be more than ten different Interest Periods in effect with respect to Bid Loans at any time. (b) Requesting Competitive Bids. Any Borrower may request the submission of Competitive Bids by delivering a Bid Request to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (i) one Business Day prior to the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Absolute Rate Loans, or (ii) four Business Days prior to the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Eurodollar Margin Bid Loans. Each Bid Request shall specify (i) which Borrower is delivering the Bid Request, (ii) the requested date of the Bid Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Bid Loans requested (which must be $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), (iv) the Type of Bid Loans requested, and (v) the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, and shall be signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower. No Bid Request shall contain a request for (i) more than one Type of Bid Loan or (ii) Bid Loans having more than three different Interest Periods. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees in its sole and absolute discretion, no Borrower may submit a Bid Request if any Borrower has submitted another Bid Request within the prior five Business Days. (c) Submitting Competitive Bids. (i) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each Bid Request received by it from any Borrower and the contents of such Bid Request. (ii) Each Lender may (but shall have no obligation to) submit a Competitive Bid containing an offer to make one or more Bid Loans in response to such Bid Request. Such Competitive Bid must be delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:30 a.m. (A) on the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Absolute Rate Loans, and (B) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Eurodollar Margin Bid Loans; provided, however, that any Competitive Bid submitted by Bank of America in its capacity as a Lender in response to any Bid Request must be submitted to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:15 a.m. on the date on which Competitive Bids are required to be delivered by the other Lenders in response to such Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid shall specify (A) the proposed date of the Bid Borrowing; (B) the principal amount of each Bid Loan for which such Competitive Bid is being made, which principal amount (x) may be equal to, greater than or less than the Commitment of the bidding Lender, (y) must be $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (z) may not exceed the principal amount of Bid Loans for which Competitive Bids were requested; (C) if the proposed Bid Borrowing is to consist of Absolute Rate Bid Loans, the Absolute Rate offered for each such Bid Loan and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (D) if the proposed Bid Borrowing is to consist of Eurodollar Margin Bid Loans, the Eurodollar Bid Margin with respect to each such Eurodollar Margin Bid Loan and the Interest Period applicable thereto; and (E) the identity of the bidding Lender. (iii) Any Competitive Bid shall be disregarded if it (A) is received after the applicable time specified in clause (ii) above, (B) is not substantially in the form of a 22 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Competitive Bid as specified herein, (C) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language, (D) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Bid Request, or (E) is otherwise not responsive to such Bid Request. Any Lender may correct a Competitive Bid containing a manifest error by submitting a corrected Competitive Bid (identified as such) not later than the applicable time required for submission of Competitive Bids. Any such submission of a corrected Competitive Bid shall constitute a revocation of the Competitive Bid that contained the manifest error. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, notify any Lender of any manifest error it detects in such Lender's Competitive Bid. (iv) Subject only to the provisions of Sections 3.02, 3.03 and 5.02 and clause (iii) above, each Competitive Bid shall be irrevocable. (d) Notice to Borrower of Competitive Bids. Not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) on the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Absolute Rate Loans, or (ii) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Eurodollar Margin Bid Loans, the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of the identity of each Lender that has submitted a Competitive Bid that complies with Section 2.03(c) and of the terms of the offers contained in each such Competitive Bid. (e) Acceptance of Competitive Bids. Not later than 11:30 a.m. (i) on the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Absolute Rate Loans, and (ii) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Bid Borrowing that is to consist of Eurodollar Margin Bid Loans, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or rejection of the offers notified to it pursuant to Section 2.03(d). The applicable Borrower shall be under no obligation to accept any Competitive Bid and may choose to reject all Competitive Bids. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Competitive Bids for each Interest Period that is accepted. The applicable Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Bid Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Bid Request; (ii) the principal amount of each Bid Loan must be $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) the acceptance of offers may be made only on the basis of ascending Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Bid Margins within each Interest Period accepted, beginning with the shortest Interest Period accepted. (f) Procedure for Identical Bids. If two or more Lenders have submitted Competitive Bids at the same Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Bid Margin, as the case may be, for the same Interest Period, and the result of accepting all of such Competitive Bids in whole (together with any other Competitive Bids at lower Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Bid Margins, as the case may be, accepted for such Interest Period in conformity with the requirements of Section 2.03(e)(iii)) would be to cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the applicable Bid Borrowing to exceed the amount specified therefor in the related Bid Request, then, unless otherwise agreed by 23 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lenders, such Competitive Bids shall be accepted as nearly as possible in proportion to the amount offered by each such Lender in respect of such Interest Period, with such accepted amounts being rounded to the nearest whole multiple of $1,000,000. (g) Notice to Lenders of Acceptance or Rejection of Bids. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender having submitted a Competitive Bid whether or not its offer has been accepted and, if its offer has been accepted, of the amount of the Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be made by it on the date of the applicable Bid Borrowing. Any Competitive Bid or portion thereof that is not accepted by the applicable Borrower by the applicable time specified in Section 2.03(e) shall be deemed rejected. (h) Notice of Eurodollar Base Rate. If any Bid Borrowing is to consist of Eurodollar Margin Bid Loans, the Administrative Agent shall determine the Eurodollar Base Rate for the relevant Interest Period, and promptly after making such determination, shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that will be participating in such Bid Borrowing of such Eurodollar Base Rate. (i) Funding of Bid Loans. Each Lender that has received notice pursuant to Section 2.03(g) that all or a portion of its Competitive Bid has been accepted by the applicable Borrower shall make the amount of its Bid Loan(s) available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 12:00 (noon) on the date of the requested Bid Borrowing. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.02, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. (j) Notice of Range of Bids. After each Competitive Bid auction pursuant to this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender that submitted a Competitive Bid in such auction of the ranges of bids submitted (without the bidder's name) and accepted for each Bid Loan and the aggregate amount of each Bid Borrowing. 2.04 LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of any Borrower or its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that the L/C Issuer may amend or extend after the Maturity Date any Letters of Credit issued by it on or before the Maturity Date, in accordance with Subsection (b) below, provided that no such extension shall extend the expiry date of any Letter of Credit beyond the date that is twelve months after the Maturity Date and no such amendment shall increase the amount available under any Letter of Credit, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of any Borrower or its Subsidiaries and any drawings thereunder; provided that after giving 24 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by a Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by such Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers' ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrowers may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if: (A) subject to Section 2.04(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the Maturity Date, unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date; (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it; (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any Laws; (C) after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, more than thirty Letters of Credit would be outstanding unless the Borrowers and the Required Lenders otherwise agree; (D) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; 25 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
(E) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or (F) a default of any Lender's obligations to fund under Section 2.04(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer's risk with respect to such Lender. (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof. (v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit. (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of a Borrower, and, if a Subsidiary is an Applicant, such Subsidiary has delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower and, if a Subsidiary is an Applicant, such Subsidiary. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least five Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment (or such shorter time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion), as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) who is the Applicant, and if the Applicant is not a Borrower, which Borrower is the Co-Applicant; (B) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the amount thereof; (D) the expiry date thereof; (E) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (F) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (w) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (x) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (y) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (z) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Applicant shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 26 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Applicant and, if applicable, the Co-Applicant and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article V shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (iii) If an Applicant so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Applicant (or, if applicable, the Co-Applicant) shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than twelve months after the Maturity Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.04(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Loan Party that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. Within 15 days after the end of each calendar month, the Administrative Agent will deliver to each of the Lenders and the Borrowers a written report of Letters of Credit that have been issued, Letters of 27 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Credit that have been amended, Letters of Credit that have expired, Auto-Extension Letters of Credit that have been automatically extended, and drawings that have been made under Letters of Credit, in each case during such calendar month. (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof and of the date (the "Honor Date") on which the L/C Issuer anticipates that payment of such drawing will be made. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Honor Date, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the applicable Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. Each deemed Committed Borrowing made pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed to be a reimbursement of the related drawing under a Letter of Credit. (ii) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.04(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.04. 28 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
(iv) Until a Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.04(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, any Borrower, any other Applicant or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.04(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative 29 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or other right that such Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower or any Subsidiary. Each Borrower and any other Applicant shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto requested by such Borrower and such Applicant that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with such Borrower's or such Applicant's instructions or other irregularity, such Borrower or such Applicant will notify the L/C Issuer as promptly as practicable. No Letter of Credit will be amended without written approval of the applicable Borrower and the L/C Issuer. Such Borrower and such Applicant shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and each Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter 30 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. Each Borrower and any other Applicant hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.04(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower and any other Applicant may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower and such Applicant, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower or such Applicant which such Borrower or such Applicant proves were caused primarily by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the date that is twelve months after the Maturity Date, any Letter of Credit for any reason remains outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the applicable Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the date that is twelve months after the Maturity Date, as the case may be). Sections 2.05 and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.04, Section 2.05 and Section 8.02(c), "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. Each Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing delivered by such Borrower as Cash Collateral. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a blocked, non-interest bearing deposit account at Bank of America. 31 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
(h) Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each. (i) Letter of Credit Fees. Each Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower equal to the Applicable Rate (converted to a daily rate) times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Maturity Date, on the date that is twelve months after the Maturity Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. Each Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (converted to a daily rate) with respect to each Letter of Credit with respect to which it is the Applicant or the Co-Applicant in the amount specified in the Fee Letter, payable on the actual daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such fronting fee shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Maturity Date, on the date that is twelve months after the Maturity Date and thereafter on demand. In addition, each Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to each Letter of Credit for which such Borrower is the Applicant or Co-Applicant as from time to time in effect. (k) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. (l) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower which is the Co-Applicant with respect to such Letter of Credit shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that such Borrower's business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 2.05 PREPAYMENTS. 32 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
(a) Any Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by any Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. (b) No Bid Loan may be prepaid without the prior consent of the applicable Bid Loan Lender. (c) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrowers shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that no Borrower shall be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Committed Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect. (d) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each Borrower agrees that if requested by the Administrative Agent (acting at the request of the Required Lenders) such Borrower will promptly prepay its Loans, together with accrued interest and will promptly Cash Collateralize its L/C Obligations; provided that no prepayment of any Bid Loan shall be made without the prior consent of the Lender thereof. Upon such prepayment, the Aggregate Commitments and the Commitment of each Lender shall automatically terminate. 2.06 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments and this Agreement, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative 33 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 2.07 REPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) Each Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of its Committed Loans outstanding on such date. (b) Each Borrower shall repay each of its Bid Loans on the last day of the Interest Period in respect thereof. 2.08 INTEREST. (a) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Bid Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for the Interest Period therefor at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Base Rate for such Interest Period plus (or minus) the Eurodollar Bid Margin, or at the Absolute Rate for such Interest Period, as the case may be. (b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by any Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, each Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all its outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest 34 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. 2.09 FEES. In addition to certain fees described in Subsections (i) and (j) of Section 2.04: (a) Facility Fee. The Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a facility fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, on the Maturity Date and on the date that is twelve months after the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (b) Utilization Fee. Each Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a utilization fee equal to the Applicable Rate (converted to a daily rate) times the Total Outstandings with respect to Loans made to it and L/C Outstandings with respect to Letters of Credit for which it was the Applicant or Co-Applicant on each day that the Total Outstandings of all Loans and L/C Obligations exceed 50% of the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or, if terminated, in effect immediately prior to such termination); provided that the utilization fee shall be payable after the Maturity Date only in respect of any day that the Outstanding Amount of Loans and L/C Borrowings on such day exceeds 50% of the amount of the Aggregate Commitments in effect immediately prior to the expiration of the Availability Period. The utilization fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and on the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate for each period during which such Applicable Rate was in effect. The utilization fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article V is not met. (c) Other Fees. (i) The Borrowers shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. (ii) Work Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders the work fees set forth in the Fee Letter in the amounts and at the times so 35 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 2.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. 2.11 EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to each Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of any Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 2.12 PAYMENTS GENERALLY. (a) All payments to be made by any Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by any Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:30 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by 36 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
the Administrative Agent after 2:30 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. (b) If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (c) Unless any Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, 12:30 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing), that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then: (i) if such Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan or Bid Loan, as the case may be, included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon such Borrower, and such Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Borrower or Applicant may have against any other Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to any Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to 37 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan or purchase its participation. (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 2.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Committed Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Committed Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. 38 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
2.14 INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS (a) Notice of Increase. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing and the Borrowers have not theretofore terminated or reduced the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to Section 2.06, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.14, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers may, from time to time, elect to (i) increase the Aggregate Commitments to an amount (for all such increases) that does not exceed $2,000,000,000 and (ii) increase the Letter of Credit Sublimit by an amount not exceeding the amount of any increase in the Aggregate Commitments); provided that each increase shall be in a minimum amount of $50,000,000. If such increase is to be effected in whole or in part through an increase in the Commitment of one or more of the existing Lenders (it being agreed that no existing Lender shall be obligated to increase its Commitment), such notice shall be accompanied by a writing executed by each existing Lender that has agreed to increase its Commitment, setting forth the amount of its increased Commitment. If such increase is to be effected in whole or in part through the addition of one or more Eligible Assignees as new Lenders, the addition of each such Eligible Assignee as a new Lender shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and such notice shall be accompanied by the written agreement of each such Eligible Assignee to become a Lender, setting forth the amount of its Commitment. (b) Assistance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent agrees to provide such assistance as the Borrowers may reasonably request in soliciting increased Commitments from existing Lenders and/or Commitments from Eligible Assignees. (c) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of each increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders (including any new Lenders) of the final allocation of such increase and such Increase Effective Date. On or before such Increase Effective Date, each Eligible Assignee that becomes a new Lender shall execute a joinder agreement to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent is authorized and directed to amend and distribute to the Lenders (including any new Lenders) a revised Schedule 2.01 that gives effect to each increase in the Aggregate Commitments and the allocation thereof among the Lenders (including any new Lenders). As soon as practicable (with the intention of avoiding or minimizing any additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.05), the applicable Borrower or Borrowers shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on each Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section. (d) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or Section 10.01 to the contrary. 39 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
ARTICLE III. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 3.01 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes not paid pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(iii) to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest, additions to tax and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto; provided, that such Borrower shall not be obligated to make a payment pursuant to this Section 3.01 in respect of penalties, interest and additions to tax attributable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, if (i) such penalties, interest and additions to tax are attributable to the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, to pay amounts paid to the Administrative Agent or such Lender by such Borrower (for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes) to the relevant Governmental Authority within thirty (30) days after receipt of such payment from such Borrower or (ii) such penalties, interest and additions to tax are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be. Within 90 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender learns of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, such Person shall give notice to the relevant Borrower of the payment by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, and of the assertion by any Governmental Authority that such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are due and payable, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect such Borrower's obligations hereunder to reimburse the Administrative Agent and such Lender for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, except that such Borrower shall not be liable for penalties, interest and other liabilities accrued or incurred after such 90 day period until such time as it receives the notice contemplated above, after which time it shall be liable for penalties, interest and other liabilities accrued or incurred prior to or during such 90 day period and accrued or incurred after such receipt. Such Borrower shall not be liable for any penalties, interest and other liabilities with respect to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent it has reimbursed the amount thereof to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the relevant Borrower by a Lender, or 40 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Within 30 days after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Each Foreign Lender, before it signs and delivers this Agreement if listed on the signature pages hereof, and before it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Foreign Lender, shall provide such Borrower and the Administrative Agent either (i) two accurate, complete and signed originals of either (x) U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form, or (y) U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, or any successor form, in each case, indicating that such Lender is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of interest hereunder free from, or subject to a reduced rate of withholding of United States Federal income tax or (ii) in the case of such a Lender that is entitled to claim exemption from withholding of United States Federal income tax under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", (x) a certificate to the effect that such Lender is (A) not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) not a "10 percent shareholder" of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (C) not a controlled foreign corporation related to any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) two accurate, complete and signed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-81MY, or any successor Form. To the extent permitted or required by applicable law, from time to time thereafter, at the request of any Borrower, each Foreign Lender shall deliver renewals or additional copies of such forms (or successor forms) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete. Upon the written request of a Borrower to the Administrative Agent and any Lender which is not a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall provide such Borrower and the Administrative Agent with two accurate, complete and signed originals of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. (f) The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrowers are not required to pay additional amounts under this Section 3.01. (g) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (g), together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent). The 41 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph (g) shall survive the payment of the Loans and termination of this Agreement. (h) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its good faith judgment, that it has actually received or realized any refund of tax or any reduction of its tax liabilities or otherwise recovered any amount in connection with any deduction or withholding or payment of any additional amount by any Borrower pursuant to Section 3.04 or this Section 3.01, such Person shall reimburse such Borrower within 60 days in an amount equal to the net benefit, after tax, and net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Person in connection with such refund, reduction or recovery; provided, that nothing in this paragraph (h) shall require any Person to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems to be confidential). In the event that the reimbursement described in the preceding sentence is determined to have been paid to any Borrower in error, such Borrower shall return such amount to the applicable Person within 60 days of when such Person is required to repay such refund of tax or is not entitled to such reduction of, or credit against, its tax liabilities. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund or direct credit in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund or direct credit and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request for such by such Borrower (whether as a result of notification that it has made of such to such Borrower or otherwise), make a claim to such Governmental Authority for such refund or direct credit and contest such Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes or liabilities if (i) such Borrower has agreed in writing to pay all of such Lender's or Administrative Agent's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to such claim or contest, (ii) such Lender or the Administrative Agent determines, in its good faith judgment, that it would not be materially disadvantaged or prejudiced as a result of such claim or contest (it being understood that the mere existence of fees, charges, costs or expenses that such Borrower has offered to and agreed to pay on behalf of such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to be materially disadvantageous to such person) and (iii) such Borrower furnishes, upon request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, an opinion of tax counsel (such opinion and such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to such Lender or the Administrative Agent) to the effect that such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were wrongly or illegally imposed. 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the applicable Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and such Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all its Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount 42 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan, or that the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request by it for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 3.04 INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY. (a) If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation by any Governmental Authority of any Law, or such Lender's compliance with any request, guideline or directive of any Governmental Authority made or issued after the date hereof, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized, in which its principal office is located or has its Lending Office (or in the case of a jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) that imposes taxes on the basis of management or control or other concept or principal of residence, the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) in which such Lender is so resident), and (iii) reserve requirements utilized, as to Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans, in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation by any Governmental Authority thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request, guideline or directive of any Governmental Authority made or issued after the date hereof, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the 43 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Borrowers shall jointly and severally pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. 3.05 COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, each Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) except as a result of circumstances set forth in Section 3.02, any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan to it other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by such Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower; or (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by such Borrower pursuant to Section 10.15; including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by any Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan was in fact so funded. 3.06 MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION. (a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the basis for such claim and a calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (b) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or 3.04, the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.15. 3.07 SURVIVAL. All of the Borrowers' obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. ARTICLE IV.

MetLife will, and will cause each of its Material Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. 6.08 USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loans will be used only for general corporate purposes (including the back-up of commercial paper) of MetLife and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; provided that no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the Regulations of the FRB, including Regulations U and X; provided further that no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or indirectly, to acquire the capital stock or business of any other Person without the consent of such Person; and provided further that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility as to the use of any such proceeds. 6.09 SUPPORT AGREEMENT.

If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above. 56 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
ARTICLE IX. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 9.01 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or Participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. (b) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this Article IX and in the definition of "Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 9.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact selected by the Administrative Agent in good faith after due inquiry. 9.03 LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or Participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, 57 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or Participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof. 9.04 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 5.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto. 9.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders. 9.06 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to 58 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person. 9.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that (a) no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct, provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the express directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section, and (b) no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of an Indemnified Liability pursuant to this Section unless such Indemnified Liability was incurred by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such or by another Agent-Related Person acting for the Administrative Agent in such capacity. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent. 59 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
9.08 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity. 9.09 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers; provided that any such notice of resignation by Bank of America shall also constitute its notice of resignation as L/C Issuer. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrowers shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrowers, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder and the receipt of any necessary approvals from the beneficiaries of any Letters of Credit and from insurance regulatory authorities, the Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer, the respective terms "Administrative Agent" and "L/C Issuer" shall mean such successor administrative agent and Letter of Credit issuer, the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated and the retiring L/C Issuer's rights, powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such retiring L/C Issuer or any other Lender, other than the obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above; provided, however, that the retiring Administrative Agent shall remain the L/C Issuer. 60 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
9.10 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.04(i) and (j), 2.09 and 10.05) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.05. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. 9.11 OTHER AGENTS; JOINT LEAD ARRANGERS AND BOOK MANAGERS. None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent," "documentation agent," "arranger," shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender.

Notices delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in Subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such Subsection (b). Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (1) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent to such Lender and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. (b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or any Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. (c) The Platform. The Borrowers hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrowers hereunder (collectively, the "Borrower Materials") by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the "Platform"). THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." THE AGENT PARTIES (AS 63 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any Agent-Related Person (collectively, the "Agent Parties") have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). (d) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature. (e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Committed Loan Notices) reasonably believed by them to be genuine and to have been given by or on behalf of the Borrowers even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice reasonably believed by them to be genuine and to have been given by or on behalf of the Borrowers. All telephonic notices to and other communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 10.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 64 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
10.04 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]. 10.05 COSTS, EXPENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Each Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Agent-Related Persons, including reasonable Attorney Costs, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans. (b) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender and the directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and Affiliates of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the use or proposed use of the proceeds of any Loan made to such Borrower or any Letter of Credit as to which such Borrower was the Applicant or the Co-Applicant, or (ii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating thereto, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. (c) To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers shall not assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan, any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 65 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
(e) No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement. (f) The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 10.06 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, rehabilitator, conservator, custodian, liquidator, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. 10.07 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (d) of this Section, (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Subsection (f) of this Section, or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (h) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this Subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in Subsection (g) of this Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each 66 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group (as defined in Schedule 10.07) and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met; (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans, the risk participations in Letters of Credit or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of Bid Loans; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); (iv) the assignment shall contain a representation by the Eligible Assignee to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable Assignment and Assumption constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Eligible Assignee in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA; and (v) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee as set forth on Schedule 10.07. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Subsection (c) of this Section from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Subsection (d) of this Section. (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers at any reasonable time 67 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or other substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register. (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or a Borrower or any of a Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to Subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.01 as though it were a Lender. (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings: "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers (each such approval not to be unreasonably 68 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not include any Borrower or any of the Borrowers' Affiliates or Subsidiaries. "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business. "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (an "SPC") the option to provide all or any part of any Committed Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Committed Loan or any L/C Obligation, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Committed Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Committed Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Administrative Agent as is required under Section 2.12(c)(ii). Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder. The making of a Committed Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Committed Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Committed Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Committed Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to Subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon 30 days' notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the 69 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.04(c)). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and the receipt of any necessary approvals from any beneficiaries of any Letters of Credit and any insurance regulatory authorities, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit. 10.08 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates' respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it or its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of any Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than any Borrower. In the event that any Lender becomes legally compelled to disclose any confidential Information pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 10.08, such Lender shall, to the extent permitted by law, give prompt written notice of that fact to the Borrowers prior to the disclosure so that the Borrowers may seek an appropriate remedy to prevent or limit such disclosure and the Lenders shall cooperate reasonably (at the expense of the Borrowers) with the Borrowers in seeking such remedy. For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such 70 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrowers, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including Federal and state securities Laws. 10.09 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Borrower, any such notice being waived by the Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 10.10 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 10.11 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 10.12 INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 71 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
10.13 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 10.14 SEVERABILITY.

(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, then such Lender shall, upon the request of such Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.04 or 3.01, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Under any circumstances set forth herein providing that the Borrowers shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this Agreement, the Borrowers may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrowers in such instance) pursuant to Section 10.07(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible Assignees procured by the Borrowers; provided, however, that if the Borrowers elect to exercise such right with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section 3.06(b), it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made requests for compensation on a similar basis and in a similar amount pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04. Upon the making of any such assignment, the Borrowers shall (x) pay in full any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.05 and (y) provide appropriate assurances and indemnities (which may include letters of credit) to the L/C Issuer as it may reasonably require with respect to any continuing obligation to fund participation interests in any L/C Obligations then outstanding. 72 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT

Each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Syndicated Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), or (ii) the seventh (7th) day prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that a Syndicated Letter of Credit shall provide by its terms, and on terms acceptable to the Agent, for renewal for successive periods of one year or less (but not beyond the seventh day prior to the Termination Date) unless and until the Agent shall have delivered 30 days' prior written notice of nonrenewal to the Beneficiary of such Syndicated Letter of Credit (which the Agent shall do only if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or if representations and warranties (except for those representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01(f) and the last sentence of Section 4.01(e)) could not be true and correct in all material respects if requested). The Agent shall promptly provide a copy of any such notice to the Account Party. (e) Obligation of Lenders. The obligation of any Lender under any Syndicated Letter of Credit shall be several and not joint and shall be in an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the aggregate Available Amount of such Syndicated Letter of Credit at the time such Syndicated Letter of Credit is issued, and each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide. No assignment of Commitment under Section 9.07 shall change or affect the liability of any Lender under any outstanding Syndicated Letter of Credit. (f) Issuance Administration. Each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall be executed and delivered by the Agent in the name and on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for, each Lender party to such Syndicated Letter of Credit, and the Agent shall act under each Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expressly provide that the Agent shall act, as the agent of each Lender to (i) execute and deliver such Syndicated Letter of Credit, (ii) receive drafts, other demands for payment and other documents presented by the Beneficiary under such Syndicated Letter of Credit, (iii) determine whether such drafts, demands and documents are in compliance with the terms and conditions of such Syndicated Letter of Credit, (iv) notify such Lender and the Account Party that a valid drawing has been made and the date that the related L/C Disbursement is to be made and (v) exercise all rights held by the issuer of a letter of credit under the documents for which such Syndicated Letter of Credit shall provide credit enhancement (or designate any Person as its representative for all such purposes under such documents); provided that the Agent shall have no obligation or liability for any L/C Disbursement under such Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the Agent as its attorney-in-fact, acting through any duly authorized officer, to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of such Lender each Syndicated Letter of Credit to be issued by such Lender hereunder and to take such other actions contemplated by this Section 2.01(f). Promptly upon the request of the Agent, each Lender will furnish to the Agent such powers of attorney or other evidence as any Beneficiary of any Syndicated Letter of Credit may reasonably request in order to demonstrate that the Agent has the power to act as attorney-in-fact for such Lender to execute and deliver such Syndicated Letter of Credit. (g) Reimbursement. (i) The Account Party agrees that it shall reimburse the Lenders in respect of their L/C Disbursements under any Syndicated Letter of Credit by paying to the Agent an amount equal to the aggregate of any L/C Disbursements no later than 2:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the Required Reimbursement Date (each such amount until paid, a "Syndicated Reimbursement Obligation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agent shall make, on behalf of any Lender, such Lender's L/C Disbursement with respect to any Syndicated Letter of Credit in accordance 16
with Section 2.01(i), then any payments made by the Account Party with respect to such Syndicated Reimbursement Obligation shall be made to, and for the benefit of, the Agent until such Lender makes payment to the Agent of all amounts required under Section 2.01(i). (ii) If the Account Party fails to reimburse the Lenders in respect of their L/C Disbursements under such Syndicated Letter of Credit on the L/C Disbursement Date, interest shall accrue from and after the L/C Disbursement Date at a rate equal to (A) on or prior to the Required Reimbursement Date, the greater of (I) LIBOR for the period from the L/C Disbursement Date to the Required Reimbursement Date plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee set forth in Section 2.03(b) or (II) the sum of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus (b) 1/2% per annum plus (c) an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee and (B) after the Required Reimbursement Date, the greater of (x) LIBOR for the period from the Required Reimbursement Date to the date such L/C Disbursement is paid plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee set forth in Section 2.03(b) plus 2.0% per annum or (y) the sum of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus (b) 2.0% per annum plus (c) an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee. (h) Disbursement Procedures. The Agent shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof (and, in any event, within any specific time in the text of the relevant Syndicated Letter of Credit), examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under any Syndicated Letter of Credit. The Agent shall promptly after such examination and before such L/C Disbursement (i) notify each Lender and the Account Party and the Guarantor by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or email) of such demand for payment, and (ii) notify each Lender whether or not the Agent will make such Lender's L/C Disbursement with respect to such Syndicated Letter of Credit available to the applicable Beneficiary in accordance with Section 2.01(i). With respect to any drawing made under a Syndicated Letter of Credit, unless the Agent has notified the Lenders that it will fund the Lenders' respective L/C Disbursements available to the Beneficiary of such Syndicated Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.01(i), each Lender will make an L/C Disbursement in respect of such Syndicated Letter of Credit promptly in accordance with its liability under such Syndicated Letter of Credit and this Agreement, such L/C Disbursement to be made to the account of the Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Agent will make such L/C Disbursement available to the Beneficiary of such Syndicated Letter of Credit by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in the funds so received, to the account identified by such Beneficiary in connection with such demand for such L/C Disbursement. Promptly following any L/C Disbursement by any Lender in respect of any Syndicated Letter of Credit, the Agent will notify the Account Party and the Guarantor of such L/C Disbursement; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Account Party of its obligation to reimburse the Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursements. (i) Intra-Day Fronting Option. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make, on behalf of any Lender, such Lender's L/C Disbursement in respect of any Syndicated Letter of Credit on the applicable L/C Disbursement Date. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent such Lender's L/C Disbursement made by the Agent on behalf of such Lender in respect of any Syndicated Letter of Credit promptly upon the request of the Agent at any time from the time such L/C Disbursement is made until the Syndicated Reimbursement Obligation with respect thereto is reimbursed by the Account Party or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Account Party for any reason (and without limiting the foregoing, if the Agent shall give any Lender notice by 2:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on any L/C Disbursement Date that it has not received reimbursement from the Account Party for the L/C Disbursement made by the Agent on behalf of such Lender on such L/C Disbursement Date, such Lender shall pay to the Agent the amount of such L/C Disbursement not later than 4:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time). Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have paid the amount of any such L/C Disbursement to the Agent after receiving a request therefor, such Lender, on the one hand, and the Account Party, on the other, severally agree to pay 17
to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such L/C Disbursement is paid by the Agent until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, (i) in the case of payment by such Lender, at the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2%, and (ii) in the case of payment by the Account Party, at the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2% (which, in the case of this clause (ii), shall be credited toward amounts owed by the Account Party pursuant to Section 2.01(g)(ii)above). If such Lender shall repay to the Agent the amount of such L/C Disbursement (plus applicable interest, if any), such amount shall constitute such Lender's L/C Disbursement under the applicable Syndicated Letter of Credit for purposes of this Agreement. The failure of any Lender to make any L/C Disbursement required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder or any Syndicated Letter of Credit to make its L/C Disbursement, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the L/C Disbursement to be made by such other Lender. The funding by the Agent of any L/C Disbursement on behalf of any Lender under the terms of this Section 2.01(i) shall not create the obligation on the Agent to fund (i) any other L/C Disbursement of such Lender, or (ii) any L/C Disbursement of any other Lender (including any such L/C Disbursement made on the same L/C Disbursement Date under the same Syndicated Letter of Credit). (j) Loss of NAIC Approval. If a Lender which had NAIC approval on the date it became a party to this Agreement shall cease to maintain such approval or otherwise shall lose such approval (a "Non-NAIC Lender"), the Account Party, the Guarantor, such Non-NAIC Lender and the other Lenders hereby agree that (i) (A) if such Non-NAIC Lender is not a Downgraded Lender, such Non-NAIC Lender shall automatically be deemed to have a Participated Commitment for Participated Letters of Credit in an amount equal to its Unused Commitment, and (B) if such Non-NAIC Lender is a Downgraded Lender, the provisions of Section 2.02(j) shall apply and, in each case, it shall thereafter cease to have a Syndicated Commitment to the extent of such Unused Commitment, and (ii) to the extent Syndicated Letters of Credit are outstanding, effective at the time the Beneficiaries execute and deliver an amendment to (A) any Syndicated Letter of Credit such that the Non-NAIC Lender is removed from such Syndicated Letter of Credit and (B) any Participated Letter of Credit issued, extended or renewed at the same time as such Syndicated Letter of Credit, such that the Available Amount under such Participated Letter of Credit is increased by an amount equal to the Non-NAIC Lender's L/C Exposure with respect to such Syndicated Letter of Credit (and the Account Party and the Guarantor agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendments to be executed and delivered by the Beneficiaries and any necessary regulatory approvals to be obtained at the earliest possible date) and any outstanding Reimbursement Obligations with respect to such Syndicated Letter of Credit have been paid in full, the aggregate Syndicated Commitments and Syndicated Letters of Credit, respectively, shall be automatically reduced by an amount equal to the Non-NAIC Lender's L/C Exposure with respect to such Syndicated Letter of Credit immediately prior to such amendment, and such Non-NAIC Lender shall be automatically deemed to have a Participated Commitment in an amount equal to such reduction in its Syndicated Commitment; provided that, if, upon the reduction of the Syndicated Commitments, the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments, then the Account Party will immediately eliminate such excess by causing the Available Amount under one or more Letters of Credit to be reduced. (k) Letter of Credit Reports. Wachovia shall furnish (i) the Agent, each Lender with a Syndicated Commitment, the Account Party and the Guarantor, by or about the fifth Business Day of each month, with a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of each Syndicated Letter of Credit issued by the Lenders with a Syndicated Commitment during the preceding month and drawings during such month under each outstanding Syndicated Letter of Credit and (ii) the Agent, each Lender with a Syndicated Commitment and the Account Party, by the fifteenth Business Day of each calendar quarter, with a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount and Stated Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Syndicated Letters of Credit issued by it. 18
SECTION 2.02. Participated Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the issuance of Syndicated Letters of Credit provided for in Section 2.01, the Account Party may request Wachovia to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Participated Letters of Credit for the account of the Account Party to a Beneficiary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.02. Each Participated Letter of Credit shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2, and shall be issued ratably with Syndicated Letters of Credit. Such Participated Letter of Credit shall be issued by Wachovia Bank, as Issuing Bank, and all references to Issuing Bank in this Section 2.02 shall be references solely to Wachovia Bank, as Issuing Bank for Participated Letters of Credit. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension. To request the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Participated Letter of Credit), the Account Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Agent (which shall promptly notify the other Lenders with a Participated Commitment thereof and provide to such Lenders as soon as practicable a copy of the Participated Letter of Credit as well as the letter of credit application referred to below if delivered to the Issuing Bank) at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the Agent and the Issuing Bank, including any request for the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit on the Closing Date, subject to approval by the Agent and the Issuing Bank) a notice in a form acceptable to the Agent (a "Participated Letter of Credit Notice") requesting the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit, or identifying the Participated Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Participated Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.02(d)), the amount of such Participated Letter of Credit, the name and address of the Beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend, as the case may be) such Participated Letter of Credit, it being understood and agreed that Participated Letters of Credit may be extended and renewed in accordance with Section 2.02(d). If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Account Party shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form (with such changes as the Issuing Bank shall deem appropriate) in connection with any request for a Participated Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by such Account Party to, or entered into by any Account Party with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Participated Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. (c) Limitations on Amounts. A Participated Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the aggregate Credit Exposure of the Lenders shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments and (ii) the Credit Exposure of each Lender participating in such Participated Letter of Credit (pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall not exceed the Commitment of such Lender. (d) Expiry Date. Each Participated Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Participated Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), or (ii) the seventh (7th) day prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that a Participated Letter of Credit shall provide by its terms, and on terms acceptable to the Issuing Bank, for renewal for successive periods of one year or less (but not beyond the seventh day prior to the Termination Date) unless and until the Issuing Bank shall have delivered 30 days' prior written notice of nonrenewal to the Beneficiary of such Participated Letter of Credit (which the Issuing Bank shall do only if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or if representations and warranties (except for those 19
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01(f) and the last sentence of Section 4.01(e)) could not be true and correct in all material respects if requested). The Agent shall promptly provide a copy of any such notice to the Account Party. (e) Participations. By the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Participated Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by Wachovia and without any further action on the part of Wachovia, or the Lenders, Wachovia hereby grants to each Lender with a Participated Commitment, and each Lender with a Participated Commitment hereby acquires from Wachovia, participation in such Participated Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Participated Letter of Credit. Each Lender with a Participated Commitment acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Participated Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Participated Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender with a Participated Commitment hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for account of Wachovia, such Lender's Ratable Share of each L/C Disbursement made by Wachovia in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit promptly upon the request of Wachovia at any time from the time such L/C Disbursement is made until such L/C Disbursement is reimbursed by the Account Party or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be disgorged or refunded to the Account Party for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly following receipt by the Agent of any payment from the Account Party pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Agent shall distribute such payment to Wachovia or, to the extent that the Lenders with a Participated Commitment have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse Wachovia, then to such Lenders and Wachovia as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender with a Participated Commitment pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse Wachovia for any L/C Disbursement shall not relieve the Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement. Upon any change in the Commitments of any of the Lenders with a Participated Commitment pursuant to Section 9.07 with respect to all outstanding Participated Letters of Credit, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section to reflect the new Ratable Share of the assigning Lender and the Assignee, respectively, of all of the Participated Commitments. (f) Reimbursement. (i) The Account Party agrees that it shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in respect of its L/C Disbursements under any Participated Letter of Credit by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the Required Reimbursement Date (each such amount until paid, a "Participated Reimbursement Obligation"). (ii) If the Account Party fails to reimburse the Lenders in respect of their L/C Disbursements under such Participated Letter of Credit on the L/C Disbursement Date, interest shall accrue from and after the L/C Disbursement Date at a rate equal to (A) on or prior to the Required Reimbursement Date, the greater of (I) LIBOR for the period from the L/C Disbursement Date to the Required Reimbursement Date plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee set forth in Section 2.03(b) or (II) the sum of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus (b) 1/2% per annum plus (c) an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee, and (B) after the Required Reimbursement Date, the greater of (x) LIBOR from the Requirement Reimbursement Date to the date such L/C Disbursement is paid plus an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee set forth in Section 2.03(b) plus 2.0% per annum or (y) the sum of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus (b) 2.0% per annum plus (c) an amount equal to the Letter of Credit Fee. (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof (and, in any event, within any time specified in the text of the relevant 20
Participated Letters of Credit), examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Participated Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Agent and the Account Party by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or email) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make a L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Account Party of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. If the Account Party shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such L/C Disbursement when due, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the Account Party in respect thereof and such Lender's Ratable Share thereof, and each Lender shall promptly pay to the Agent, for account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Ratable Share of such L/C Disbursement. (h) Letter of Credit Reports. Wachovia shall furnish (i) to the Agent, with a copy to the Account Party and the Guarantor, by or about the fifth Business Day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Participated Letters of Credit issued by it during the preceding month and drawings during such month under each outstanding Participated Letter of Credit and (ii) to the Agent and each Lender with a Participated Commitment, with a copy to the Account Party, by the fifteenth Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount and Stated Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Participated Letters of Credit issued by it. (i) Failure to Make L/C Disbursements. The failure of any Lender to make the L/C Disbursement to be made by it on the date specified in Section 2.02(e) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its L/C Disbursement on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the L/C Disbursement to be made by such other Lender on such date. (j) Downgraded Lender. (i) If a Downgrade Event shall occur with respect to (a) any Downgraded Lender or (b) any other Lender with a Participated Commitment and, as a result thereof, such other Lender becomes a Downgraded Lender, then the Agent or Wachovia as Issuing Bank with respect to Participated Letters of Credit may, by notice to such Downgraded Lender and the Account Party within 45 days after the Agent (or Wachovia, whichever have given the notice) becomes aware of such Downgrade Event (any such notice a "Downgrade Notice"), request that the Account Party and the Guarantor use reasonable commercial efforts to replace such Lender as a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.02(k) as soon as possible. If such Lender is not so replaced within 45 days after receipt by the Account Party of such Downgrade Notice, then (x) if no Default exists and such Downgraded Lender has not exercised its right to remain a Lender hereunder pursuant to clause (y) below, the following shall occur concurrently: (A) the aggregate Participated Commitments shall be reduced by the amount of the Participated Commitment of such Downgraded Lender, (B) the Account Party shall pay all amounts owed to such Downgraded Lender hereunder or in connection herewith, (C) if, upon the reduction of the Participated Commitments under clause (A) above and the payment under clause (B) above, the Available Amount of all Participated Letters of Credit would exceed the aggregate amount of the Participated Commitments, then the Account Party will use its best efforts to eliminate such excess by causing the Available Amount under one or more Letters of Credit to be reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess; provided, however, that, in the event that the Account Party is unable to eliminate such excess, the Account Party shall deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account cash collateral in an amount equal to such excess, and (D) upon completion of the events in (A), (B) and (C) above, such Downgraded Lender shall cease to be a party to this Agreement or (y) if a Default exists or, not later than 30 days after receipt of such Downgrade Notice, such Downgraded Lender notifies the Account Party, Wachovia and the Agent that such Downgraded Lender elects to provide (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) cash collateral to the Agent for (or if such Downgraded Lender is unable, without regulatory approval, to provide cash collateral, a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the Agent covering) its 21
contingent obligations to reimburse Wachovia for its Participated Commitment, such Downgraded Lender shall be obligated to (and each Lender agrees that in such circumstances it will) deliver to the Agent (I) immediately, cash collateral (or, as aforesaid, a letter of credit) in an amount equal to its Participated Commitments and (II) from time to time thereafter (so long as it is a Downgraded Lender), cash collateral (or, as aforesaid, a letter of credit) sufficient to cover any increase in its Participated Commitments as a result of any proposed issuance of or increase in a Participated Letter of Credit. Any funds provided by a Downgraded Lender for such purpose shall be maintained in segregated deposit accounts in the name of Wachovia at the Agent's principal offices in the United States (each a "Downgrade Account"). The funds so deposited in any Downgrade Account (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) shall be used only in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 2.02(j). (ii) If any Downgraded Lender shall be required to fund its participation in a payment under a Participated Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.02(e), then the Agent shall apply the funds deposited in the applicable Downgrade Account by such Downgraded Lender (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) to fund such participation. The deposit of funds in a Downgrade Account by any Downgraded Lender (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) shall not constitute a Participated Reimbursement Obligation (and the Downgraded Lender shall not be entitled to interest on such funds except as provided in Section 2.02(j)(iii) below) unless and until (and then only to the extent that) such funds (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) are used by the Agent to fund the participation of such Downgraded Lender pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.02(j)(ii). (iii) Funds in a Downgrade Account shall be invested in such investments as may be agreed between the Agent and the applicable Downgraded Lender, and the income from such investments shall be distributed to such Downgraded Lender from time to time as agreed between the Agent and such Downgraded Lender. The Agent will (x) from time to time, upon request by a Downgraded Lender, release to such Downgraded Lender any amount on deposit in the applicable Downgrade Account in excess of the Participated Commitments of such Downgraded Lender (or, if applicable, not draw under any such letter of credit in excess of the Participated Commitments of such Downgraded Lender) and (y) upon the earliest to occur of (A) the effective date of any replacement of such Downgraded Lender as a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, (B) the termination of such Downgraded Lender's Participated Commitment pursuant to Section 2.02(j)(i) or (C) the first Business Day after receipt by the Agent of evidence (reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) that such Lender is no longer a Downgraded Lender, release to such Lender all amounts on deposit in the applicable Downgrade Account (or, if applicable, return such letter of credit to such Lender for cancellation). (iv) At any time any Downgraded Lender is required to maintain cash collateral with the Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02(j), Wachovia shall have no obligation to issue or increase any Participated Letter of Credit unless such Downgraded Lender has provided sufficient funds as cash collateral (or a letter of credit satisfactory to Wachovia, as aforesaid) to the Agent to cover all Participated Commitments of such Downgraded Lender (including in respect of the Participated Letter of Credit to be issued or increased). (k) Replacement of Downgraded Lender. At any time any Lender is a Downgraded Lender, the Account Party or Wachovia, as Issuing Bank with respect to Participated Letters of Credit, may replace such Downgraded Lender as a party to this Agreement to the extent of the Downgraded Lender's Participated Commitment with one or more Eligible Assignees, and upon notice from the Account Party such Downgraded Lender shall assign pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, and without recourse or warranty, its Participated Commitment, its participation in, and rights and obligations with respect to, Participated Letters of Credit, and all of its other rights and obligations hereunder to such Eligible Assignee or Eligible Assignees for a purchase price equal to the sum of the principal amount of the Participated Commitments so assigned, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, such Downgraded 22
Lender's Ratable Share of all accrued and unpaid fees payable pursuant to Section 2.03 and all other obligations owed to such Downgraded Lender hereunder, in each case to the extent such fees and other obligations relate to Participated Letters of Credit. (l) Receipt of NAIC Approval. If a Lender which did not have NAIC approval on the date it became a party to this Agreement shall receive or obtain such approval thereafter (a "Subsequent-NAIC Lender"), the Account Party, the Guarantor, such Subsequent-NAIC Lender and the other Lenders hereby agree that (i) (A) if such Subsequent-NAIC Lender is not a Downgraded Lender, such Subsequent-NAIC Lender shall automatically be deemed to have a Syndicated Commitment for Syndicated Letters of Credit in an amount equal to its Unused Commitment, and (B) if such Subsequent-NAIC Lender is a Downgraded Lender, the provisions of Section 2.02(j) shall apply and, in each case, it shall thereafter cease to have a Participated Commitment to the extent of such Unused Commitment, and (ii) to the extent Participated Letters of Credit are outstanding, effective on the date that the Beneficiaries agree to an amendment to any Participated Letter of Credit such that an amount equal to the Ratable Share thereof of the Subsequent-NAIC Lender is removed from such Participated Letter of Credit (and the Account Party and the Guarantor agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment to be executed by the Beneficiaries and any necessary regulatory approvals to be obtained at the earliest possible date), the aggregate Participated Commitments and Participated Letters of Credit, respectively, shall be automatically reduced by an amount equal to the Subsequent-NAIC Lender's Participated Commitments and such Subsequent-NAIC Lender shall be automatically deemed to have a Syndicated Commitment in an amount equal to each reduction in its Participated Commitment; provided that, if, upon the reduction of the Participated Commitments, the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments, then the Account Party will immediately eliminate such excess by causing the Available Amount under one or more Letters of Credit to be reduced. SECTION 2.03. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Guarantor, on behalf of the Account Party, agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee on the aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment (whether or not utilized) from (and including) the Closing Date in the case of each Initial Lender and from (and including) the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the later of the Termination Date and the payment in full of all obligations hereunder at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for Facility Fees in effect from time to time, payable (for the period commencing on the Closing Date) in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on the first end-of-quarter date after the Closing Date, and on the Termination Date. For purposes of this Section 2.03(a), from and after the Termination Date, each Lender's Commitment shall be deemed to be in an amount equal to its Ratable Share of the sum of (i) the Available Amount, if any, of the Letters of Credit plus (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the L/C Disbursements for which reimbursement has not been received. (b) Letter of Credit Fees.

Subject to Section 3.03, the Account Party and the Lenders agree that, as of the Closing Date, each Existing Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Account Party under the Existing L/C Agreement and set forth on Schedule 2.06 on the Closing Date will be deemed continued for the account of the Account Party under this Agreement as of the date of the issuance thereof.

(b) Default Interest with Respect to L/C Disbursements. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, require the Account Party to pay interest ("Default Interest") on (i) the unpaid reimbursement amount with respect to each L/C Disbursement owing to each Lender, payable in arrears from time to time as demanded and on the date such reimbursement amount is paid in full, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such L/C Disbursement pursuant to clause (a) above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be L/C Disbursements pursuant to clause (a) above; provided, however, that following acceleration pursuant to Section 6.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Agent.

and/or the Guarantor shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in same day funds for deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to such excess. Such funds shall be applied or disbursed in accordance with Section 6.02, in all cases as if Section 6.02 applied thereto. SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), after the Effective Date, there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.10 any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the Account Party shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Account Party and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) enacted, made or becoming effective after the Effective Date affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Account Party shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation for any reduced rate of return associated with such increase in capital in light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Account Party and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) If it becomes unlawful in any jurisdiction for a Lender to perform any of its obligations contemplated in this Agreement or to make any L/C Disbursements in accordance with such Lender's Commitment, (i) such Lender shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event; (ii) upon the Agent notifying the Account Party and the Guarantor, the Commitment of such Lender will be immediately cancelled; and (iii) with respect to Syndicated Letters of Credit, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-NAIC Lender and the provisions of Section 2.01(j) shall apply or, with respect to Participated Letters of Credit, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Downgraded Lender and the provisions of Section 2.02(j) shall apply. (d) Failure or delay of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Account Party shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more that 30 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Account Party of the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor. (e) In the event that any Lender demands payment of material costs or material additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10 or Section 2.12, then (subject to such Lender's right to 26
rescind such demand or assertion within 10 days after the notice from the Account Party referred to below) the Account Party may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and so long as such costs or additional amounts are materially more than those charged by other Lenders and so long as the Beneficiaries agree to the assignment below (and the Account Party and the Guarantor agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Beneficiaries to agree to such assignment at the earliest possible date), upon 20 days' prior written notice to such Lender and the Agent, elect to cause such Lender to assign its Commitment in full to one or more Persons selected by the Account Party so long as (a) each such Person satisfies the criteria of an Eligible Assignee and is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, (b) such Lender receives payment in full in cash of any outstanding L/C Disbursements made by it and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due and payable to such Lender as of the date of such assignment (including, without limitation, amounts owing pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 9.04) and (c) each such Lender assignee agrees to accept such assignment and to assume all obligations of such Lender hereunder in accordance with Section 9.07. SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The Guarantor and, for the period from and after the Closing Date, the Account Party shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at the Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.10, 2.12 or 9.04) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) The Guarantor and, for the period from and after the Closing Date, the Account Party hereby authorize each Lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Guarantor's and the Account Party's accounts, as applicable, with such Lender any amount so due. (c) All computations of interest, fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be. (e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from (i) the Guarantor or (ii) from the period from and after the Closing Date, the Guarantor or the Account Party prior to the date on which any payment owed by the Guarantor or the Account Party, as the case may be, is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Guarantor or the Account Party, as the case may be, will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Guarantor or the Account Party, as the case may be, has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be 27
distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Guarantor or the Account Party, as the case may be, shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, to or for the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made (the "Original Sum"), (ii) the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall pay to the Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, an amount equal to the Original Sum and (iii) the Guarantor shall pay an amount equal to the full amount of such deductions to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Guarantor shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other documents to be delivered hereunder (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) The Guarantor shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor accompanied by evidence of the imposition or payment of the applicable Taxes or Other Taxes. (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. In the case of any payment hereunder or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, by a payor that is not a United States person, if the Account Party determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, the 28
Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "United States" and "United States person" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code. (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, with two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date and the Lender assignee is similarly entitled under United States federal law and regulations relating to withholding tax, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in Section 2.12(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.12(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes. SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the obligations owing to it hereunder (other than in connection with a payment in respect of an L/C Disbursement made by an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.01(g) 2.02(f), 2.10, 2.12 or 9.04(c)) in excess of its Ratable Share of payments on account of the L/C Disbursements obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the obligations owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall 29
repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Account Party agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Account Party in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.14. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Account Party to such Lender resulting from each L/C Disbursement applicable to such Lender from time to time, including the amount of Reimbursement Obligations and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of L/C Disbursements. (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each applicable L/C Disbursement made under a Letter of Credit, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any Reimbursement Obligation or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Account Party to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Account Party hereunder and each Lender's share thereof. (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Account Party to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Account Party under this Agreement. SECTION 2.15. Use of Proceeds. The Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Account Party agrees that it shall use such Letters of Credit) solely to support the reinsurance provided from time to time by the Account Party to the Beneficiaries.

winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for any substantial part of its property and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted against it (but not instituted by it), either such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 days, or any of the actions sought in such proceeding (including, without limitation, the entry of an order for relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for, it or for any substantial part of its property) shall occur; or the Account Party, the Beneficiaries, the Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary shall take any corporate action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this subsection (e); or (f) One or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $300,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) shall be rendered against the Account Party, the Beneficiaries, the Guarantor, or any Significant Subsidiary or any combination thereof and the same shall remain undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed; or (g) The Account Party ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Guarantor, or a Change of Control shall occur; or (h) An ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in liability of the Guarantor and its Significant Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount exceeding $200,000,000 in any year; or (i) The Guaranty shall have been determined by a competent court to be unenforceable or the Guarantor shall have asserted in writing to any of the Lenders or the Agent that the Guaranty is unenforceable, then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Account Party, declare the obligation of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit to be terminated in whole or in part, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Account Party, declare any or all Reimbursement Obligations, all interest thereon and any or all other amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon any or all Reimbursement Obligations, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Account Party; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Account Party under Bankruptcy Law, (A) the obligation of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (B) all Reimbursement Obligations, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Account Party. SECTION 6.02. Actions in Respect of Letters of Credit upon Default. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders, irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Section 6.01 or otherwise, make demand upon the Account Party and/or the Guarantor to, and forthwith upon such demand the Account Party and/or the Guarantor will, (a) pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in same day funds at the Agent's office designated in such demand, for deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding, or (b) make 43
such other collateral arrangements in respect of the outstanding Letters of Credit as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Law, the Account Party and/or the Guarantor will automatically and without any requirement of notice pay to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in same day funds, for deposit to the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Account Party and the Guarantor. If at any time the Agent determines that any funds held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account are subject to any right or interest of any Person other than the Agent and the Lenders or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the Account Party and/or the Guarantor will, forthwith upon demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account that are free and clear of any such right and interest. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit, to the extent funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Banks to the extent permitted by applicable law, and if so applied, then such reimbursement shall be deemed a repayment of the corresponding L/C Disbursement, if any, in respect of such Letter of Credit; provided that, to the extent cash collateral is on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account pursuant to Section 2.02(j)(i)(C), such cash collateral shall be applied only to an L/C Disbursement made under Participated Letters of Credit. To the extent that the cash amount deposited in the L/C Cash Deposit Account exceeds the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit plus all fees, costs and expenses that may be payable on or before the Termination Date, and all other obligations of the Account Party hereunder, such excess shall be promptly returned to the Account Party or the Guarantor upon written request therefor. ARTICLE VII GUARANTY SECTION 7.01. Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all obligations of the Account Party now or hereafter existing under or in respect of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for Reimbursement Obligations, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Account Party to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of this Agreement but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Account Party. SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute. (a) The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are absolute, unconditional and independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of the Account Party under or in respect of this Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Account Party or whether the Account Party is joined in any such action 44
or actions; provided that the Guarantor shall retain all the defenses that the Guarantor would have had if it were jointly and severally liable with the Account Party for the Account Party's obligations under this Agreement (it being understood and agreed in any event that the Guarantor waives all suretyship defenses, including those set forth below in this Section 7.02). The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, or any agreement or instrument relating thereto; (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of the Account Party under or in respect of this Agreement, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to the Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise; (iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any manner of application of any collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of the Account Party under this Agreement or any other assets of the Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries; (vi) any failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Account Party any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Account Party now or hereafter known to the Agent or such Lender (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Agent and the Lenders to disclose such information); (vii) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this Guaranty or any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction of liability of the Guarantor or other guarantor or surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or (viii)any other circumstance other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Account Party or any other guarantor or surety. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Account Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 45
SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Account Party or any other Person or any collateral. (b) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future. (c) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Agent or any Lender that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against the Account Party, any other guarantor or any other Person or any collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder. (d) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by the Agent or such Lender. (e) The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in Section 7.02 and this Section 7.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. SECTION 7.04. Subrogation. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against the Account Party or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against the Account Party or any other insider guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Account Party or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (b) the Termination Date, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this 46
Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and (iii) the Termination Date shall have occurred, the Agent and the Lenders will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty. SECTION 7.05. Subordination. The Guarantor hereby subordinates any and all debts, liabilities and other obligations owed to the Guarantor by the Account Party (the "Subordinated Obligations") to the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Section 7.05: (a) Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Account Party, the Guarantor agrees that the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (including all interest and expenses accruing after the commencement of a proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, whether or not constituting an allowed claim in such proceeding ("Post Petition Interest")) before the Guarantor receives payment of any Subordinated Obligations. (b) Turn-Over. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Account Party), the Guarantor shall, if the Agent so requests, collect, enforce and receive payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee for the Agent and the Lenders and deliver such payments to the Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations (including all Post Petition Interest), together with any necessary endorsements or other instruments of transfer, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. (c) Agent Authorization. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to the Account Party), the Agent is authorized and empowered (but without any obligation to so do), in its discretion, (i) in the name of the Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest), and (ii) to require the Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any amounts received on such obligations to the Agent for application to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest). SECTION 7.06. Continuing Guaranty; Assignments. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty of payment and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the later of (i) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (ii) the Termination Date, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Agent and the Lenders and their successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Agent or any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments, the L/C Disbursements owing to it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Agent or such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in Section 9.07. The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Lenders. 47
ARTICLE VIII THE AGENT, ETC. SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and Issuing Bank, as applicable) hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice and communication given to it by the Account Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 8.02. Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any Issuing Bank nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (a) as to Wachovia as the "Agent" (as defined in the Syndicated Letters of Credit) for the Syndicated Letters of Credit and as Issuing Bank with respect to Participated Letters of Credit, its willful failure in such capacities to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of drafts and certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit and, in the case of a Syndicated Letter of Credit, after its receipt of appropriate funds from the other Lenders with Syndicated Commitments and (b) as to Issuing Banks under Syndicated Letters of Credit, any such Issuing Bank's willful failure to make payment to Wachovia as "Agent" (as defined in the Syndicated Letters of Credit) under a Syndicated Letter of Credit after Wachovia as such "Agent" has confirmed to the Issuing Bank that drafts and documents strictly complying with the terms of such Syndicated Letter of Credit have been presented. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (a) may treat the Lender that made any L/C Disbursement as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by a Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Guarantor), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance, observance or satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Account Party or the Guarantor or the existence at any time of any Default or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Guarantor; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties. SECTION 8.03. Wachovia and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitments, the L/C Disbursements made by it, Wachovia shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wachovia in its individual capacity. 48
Wachovia and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Guarantor, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Guarantor or any such Subsidiary, all as if Wachovia were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose any information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates relating to the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was obtained or received in any capacity other than as Agent. SECTION 8.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. SECTION 8.05. Indemnification. (a) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Account Party or the Guarantor) from and against such Lender's Ratable Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement, to the extent any such claim relates to an event arising on or after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"); provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Account Party. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 8.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party. (b) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Issuing Banks (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Account Party or the Guarantor) from and against such Lender's Ratable Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank hereunder or in connection herewith, to the extent any such claim relates to an event arising on or after the Closing Date; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct or (a) in the case of Wachovia as the "Agent" (as defined in the Syndicated Letters of Credit) for Syndicated Letters of Credit and Issuing Bank with respect to the Participated Letters of Credit, its willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of drafts and certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit and in the case of a Syndicated Letter of Credit, after its receipt of appropriate funds from the other Lenders with Syndicated Commitments, and (b) as to Issuing Banks under Syndicated Letters of Credit, any such Issuing Bank's willful failure to make payment to Wachovia as "Agent" (as defined in the Syndicated Letters of Credit) under a Syndicated Letter of Credit after Wachovia as such "Agent" has confirmed to the Issuing Bank that drafts and documents strictly complying with the terms of such Syndicated Letter of Credit have been 49
presented. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse any such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Account Party under Section 9.04, to the extent that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Account Party. (c) The failure of any Lender to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any amount required to be paid by the Lenders to the Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank for its Ratable Share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank for such other Lender's Ratable Share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder. Each of the Agent and each Issuing Bank agrees to return to the Lenders their respective Ratable Shares of any amounts paid under this Section 8.05 that are subsequently reimbursed by the Account Party. SECTION 8.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the Lenders, the Account Party and the Guarantor. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, with the consent (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) of the Guarantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. SECTION 8.07. No Responsibility. It is understood and agreed by all parties hereto that neither the Arrangers, the Co-Administrative Agents, the Co-Syndication Agents nor the Documentation Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder or in connection herewith. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by the Account Party or the Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all affected Lenders, do any of the following: (a) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01, (b) increase the Commitments of the Lenders, (c) reduce the amount of, or interest on, any Reimbursement Obligations or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) postpone any date fixed for any payment of, or interest on, any Reimbursement Obligations or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or extend the Termination Date, (e) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate Credit Exposure, the number of Lenders, that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, or the definition of Required Lenders, (f) reduce or limit the obligations of the Guarantor under Section 7.01 or release the Guarantor or otherwise limit the Guarantor's liability to the Agent and 50

The Guarantor acknowledges that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy or 51
completeness of the Communications or the Platform and each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or the Platform.

Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Agent in writing of such Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address. SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies; Entire Agreement. No failure on the part of any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. This Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties with respect hereto. SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Guarantor agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Arrangers in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, (i) all due diligence, syndication (including printing, distribution and bank meetings), transportation, computer, duplication, consultant, and audit expenses and (ii) the reasonable fees and expenses of one primary counsel for the Agent and the Arrangers with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent and the Arrangers as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The Guarantor further agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without limitation, counsel fees and expenses), in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent and each Lender in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a). (b) The Guarantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in connection therewith), this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the L/C Disbursements, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense (i) is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) is the result of claims of Lenders or the Agent against other Lenders or the Agent that are not attributable to the Account Party's or the Guarantor's actions and for which the Account Party and the Guarantor otherwise has no liability. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.04(b) applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such 52
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Account Party or the Guarantor, or any of their directors, equityholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Account Party and the Guarantor also agree not to assert any claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages against the Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the L/C Disbursements. (c) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Account Party and the Guarantor hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Account Party and the Guarantor contained in Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to declare the obligations under this Agreement due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Account Party or the Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of the Account Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Account Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be, after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may have. SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. Upon (a) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01, Sections 2.03(d) and 2.11 and Articles VIII and IX shall become effective and (b) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02, the remaining sections of the Agreement shall become effective and, in each case thereafter, such sections shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Account Party, the Guarantor, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither the Account Party nor the Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders. SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may and, if demanded by the Account Party (following a demand by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12) or by Wachovia or the Account Party in accordance with Section 2.02(k) upon at least five Business Days' notice to such Lender and the Agent, will assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, its Unused Commitment, the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, and its participations or position in Letters of Credit); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement related to the Commitments assigned thereby, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to an Eligible Assignee that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Commitment or Unused Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) each such assignment shall be 53
to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Account Party pursuant to this Section 9.07(a) shall be arranged by the Account Party after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Account Party pursuant to this Section 9.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Account Party or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, (vi) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 payable by the parties to each such assignment, provided further, however, that in the case of each assignment made as a result of a demand by the Account Party, such recordation fee shall be payable by the Account Party except that no such recordation fee shall be payable in the case of an assignment made at the request of the Account Party to an Eligible Assignee that is an existing Lender, and (vii) each assignment of Unused Commitment shall be subject to the approval of the Account Party, such approval not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, THAT NO LENDER MAY ASSIGN ANY OBLIGATION UNDER A SYNDICATED LETTER OF CREDIT UNLESS AN AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION OR SUPPLEMENT TO SUCH SYNDICATED LETTER OF CREDIT APPROVED BY THE BENEFICIARY AND THE AGENT IS CONCURRENTLY DELIVERED TO THE AGENT REMOVING OR ADJUSTING, AS THE CASE MAY BE, THE ASSIGNOR'S SYNDICATED COMMITMENT AND SYNDICATED REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION AND REPLACING OR ADJUSTING THE SAME WITH A SYNDICATED COMMITMENT (AND SYNDICATED REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF) THE ASSIGNEE. Each Lender may assign to any Federal Reserve Bank as security, all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, its Unused Commitment, the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, and its participations in Letters of Credit) without the consent of the Account Party or the Agent. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 9.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such assignment) and be released from its obligations (other than its obligations under Section 8.05 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior such assignment) under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Account Party of the Guarantor or the performance or observance by the Account Party or the Guarantor of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; 54
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Account Party and the Guarantor. (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the L/C Disbursements owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Account Party, the Guarantor, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Account Party, the Guarantor or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) Each Lender (including, for these purposes, Wachovia, as Issuing Bank of Participated Letters of Credit) may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the L/C Disbursements owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Account Party hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Account Party, the Guarantor, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any consent to any departure by the Account Party or the Guarantor therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Guarantor furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Guarantor; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Guarantor Information relating to the Guarantor received by it from such Lender. 55
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Reimbursement Obligations owing to it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. Neither the Agent nor any Lender may disclose to any third Person any confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries (such information being referred to collectively herein as the "Guarantor Information"), except that each of the Agent and each of the Lenders may disclose Guarantor Information (a) to its and its affiliates' employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors (it being understood that such disclosure shall be made solely in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Guarantor Information and instructed to keep such Guarantor Information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (and in the event of any such disclosure under this clause (c), the disclosing party shall give prompt notice to the Account Party and the Guarantor thereof to the extent permitted by applicable law), (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.08, to any assignee or participant or prospective assignee or participant, (g) to the extent such Guarantor Information (i) is or becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.08 by the Agent or such Lender, or (ii) is or becomes available to the Agent or such Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Guarantor, (h) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.08, and with the consent of the Guarantor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), to any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, swap or derivative transaction relating to the Account Party, the Guarantor, any Subsidiaries and the Reimbursement Obligations; and (i) with the consent of the Guarantor.

Exhibit 99.1 Public Relations MetLife, Inc. For Immediate Release One MetLife Plaza 27-01 Queens Plaza North [MetLife Logo] Long Island City, NY 11101 Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE BOARD NAMES C. ROBERT HENRIKSON NEXT CEO ------------------------------------------------ ROBERT H. BENMOSCHE SETS RETIREMENT PLANS New York, NY, April 26, 2005 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced today that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert H. Benmosche, has advised the Company's Board that he will retire in the spring of 2006. The Board, which has been engaged in succession planning for over a year, unanimously elected C. Robert (Rob) Henrikson, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, to the Board of Directors and named him to succeed Benmosche. Rob Henrikson became President and COO, overseeing all of MetLife's revenue-generating businesses, including the Individual, Institutional, Auto & Home, International and Asset Management business segments, as well as MetLife Bank, in June 2004. During more than 33 years with MetLife, he has held numerous executive positions, including President of MetLife's U.S. Insurance and Financial Services businesses from 2002 to 2004. Mr. Benmosche, who was named to his current positions in 1998, has led the 137-year-old company through a successful demutualization and substantial growth in its core businesses. On January 31, 2005, MetLife announced that it will acquire Travelers Life and Annuity from Citigroup for $11.5 billion. "Over the past several years, MetLife has developed a strong performance-based business culture, with a talented and deep management team," Mr. Benmosche said. "We have solid platforms for growth in our core life insurance and annuity businesses and a growing international presence, and we have developed a comprehensive plan for the smooth and rapid integration of the Travelers business into MetLife. With a closing of that transaction by the summer of 2005, we fully expect to complete the integration of the businesses by December 2005.
"As I look ahead with confidence to the completion of the Travelers integration, and consider the overall strength of both the company and its management team, I have concluded that this is the right time to set a management transition schedule. The spring of 2006 is the time I want to commence an active and fulfilling retirement, leaving MetLife in the strongest possible position to go forward as a leader in our industry. Rob Henrikson is an exceptionally talented leader, with broad experience in the financial services and insurance industry. I believe he is the ideal person to lead MetLife through its next growth phase." MetLife said its Board has been engaged in ongoing succession planning that included a review of internal and external candidates. In February 2005, with the assistance of outside advisors, the non-management Directors met in executive session to continue their review of the background, experience and attributes of possible internal and external candidates. "With the successful transformation of the company's culture and the focusing of our business strategy in the past several years under Bob's leadership, MetLife can look ahead to a new era of growth as we serve the financial security needs of Americans and an expanding global middle class," Mr. Henrikson said. "With current demographic trends and the shift toward greater reliance on individual responsibility for retirement and other financial planning needs, our core businesses, including life insurance and annuities, have never been more relevant. "With our highly skilled agency force, and an exceptionally talented management team, we are well-positioned to serve our targeted customer base and build value for all of our stakeholders. I look forward to working with our outstanding people to maximize our opportunities by building on the foundation so effectively set by Bob and the Board." Mr. Henrikson, who will turn 58 next month, began his career at Metlife as a sales representative in 1972, and held roles of increasing breadth and responsibility, heading up the pensions business, group insurance and retirement and savings businesses, and both group and individual businesses at MetLife, representing 90% of total revenues for the company. He serves on the boards of various MetLife entities, including MetLife Auto & Home, MetLife Bank, and MetLife Foundation. In addition, he has been actively involved in industry organizations and initiatives, and has testified at Congressional, Department of Labor and other agency hearings regarding pension and related retirement security matters. He is a member of the executive committee of the American Benefits Council; Chairman of the Wharton School's S.S. Huebner Foundation for Insurance Education; a member of the CSIS's Commission on Global Aging; and a board member of The Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership. Henrikson received his B. A. degree from the University of Pennsylvania and his J.D. degree from Emory University School of Law. In addition, he is a graduate of the Wharton School's Advanced Management Program. Mr. Benmosche, who will turn 61 next month, joined MetLife as an Executive Vice President in 1995 and was President and Chief Operating Officer from November 1997 through June 1998.
He was named Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer in July 1998. Prior to joining MetLife, he spent over 13 years at PaineWebber Group Incorporated, including service as Executive Vice President from 1989 to 1995.
