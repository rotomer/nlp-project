EXHIBIT 99.1 PUBLIC RELATIONS For Immediate Release News MetLife, Inc. One MetLife Plaza 27-01 Queens Plaza North Long Island City, NY 11101 (METLIFE LOGO) (SNOOPY GRAPHIC) Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS REPORTS RECORD NET INCOME OF $1.33 PER SHARE, A 68% INCREASE REPORTS RECORD OPERATING EARNINGS OF $1.11 PER SHARE, A 42% INCREASE UPDATES FULL YEAR 2005 OPERATING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR 2006 ANNOUNCES FINANCING DETAILS FOR TRAVELERS ACQUISITION NEW YORK, May 3, 2005 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported first quarter 2005 net income of $987 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared with $598 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004. (1) Operating earnings, operating earnings per diluted share and book value per common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income per diluted share) are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to GAAP measures in this press release are provided in the non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section below.
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS - - Achieved record quarterly net income of $987 million - - Earned total premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year period - - Continued strong investment spreads "MetLife had a remarkable first quarter," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "We generated record quarterly net income, record operating earnings and grew our top-line results. We continue to leverage MetLife's leading market positions to identify growth opportunities in the marketplace that not only enable us to provide comprehensive financial solutions for our customers, but also generate strong returns for shareholders." Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 were $821 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with $595 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the prior year period. EARNINGS GUIDANCE "We are revising our full year 2005 operating earnings guidance of between $3.50 and $3.65 per share, which we announced last December on Investor Day, to between $3.90 and $4.05 per share. Our new guidance reflects our very strong results this quarter, anticipated strong results for the remainder of 2005 and our expectation that MetLife's acquisition of Citigroup's Travelers Life & Annuity and substantially all of Citigroup's international insurance businesses will close this summer and be accretive to earnings during the second half of 2005," added Benmosche. "At this time, we are also announcing preliminary guidance for full year 2006 operating earnings, which we expect to be between $4.25 and $4.50 per share," continued Benmosche. FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income to operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS REMAIN STRONG Institutional Business operating earnings for the first quarter of 2005 were $324 million, compared with $317 million in the prior year period. Operating earnings in both periods were strong. The improvement in earnings in the segment was primarily due to growth in the business and continued strong, but lower, interest spreads in the group life and Retirement & Savings businesses. This was partially offset by higher expenses, which are largely attributable to the impact of unusually low expenses in the prior year period. Excluding the favorable prior year period underwriting results in the Retirement & Savings business, underwriting results generally improved across most products. During the quarter, Retirement & Savings net investment income grew 12% compared to the prior year period largely due to an increase in the asset base driven by favorable sales, particularly in the structured settlement business, and higher corporate joint venture income. In addition to growth in group life premiums, fees and other revenues during the quarter, non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues increased 16% over the prior year period due 2
to continued growth in the small market and long-term care. Growth in long-term care was due, in part, to the early 2004 acquisition of TIAA-CREF's long-term care insurance business and sales growth in the Individual Business independent channels. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 70% Individual Business operating earnings were $318 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $187 million in the prior year period. Results in Individual Business were driven by higher earnings in the annuity product line due to overall growth in this product segment, as well as very strong interest spreads and unusually low expenses due to the elimination of certain expense liabilities. Variable/universal life results benefited from higher interest margins, higher fee income and lower expenses. In addition, traditional life results benefited from favorable mortality and unusually low expenses. Fees for the investment-type products within the annuity business increased, while first year premiums and deposits for the universal life business were down slightly from the prior year period. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS UP 65% Auto & Home operating earnings were $76 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $46 million in the prior year period. Auto & Home's results benefited from lower non-catastrophe losses compared with the prior-year period and were primarily driven by lower auto severities and homeowners frequencies. As a result, the segment's non-catastrophe combined ratio improved to 90.9% for the first quarter of 2005. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 52% International operating earnings were $67 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $44 million in the prior year period. Business growth in Latin America and Asia, including excellent underwriting and interest margins, contributed to a very strong quarter. INVESTMENTS During the first quarter of 2005, corporate joint venture income, bond prepayment fees and commercial mortgage prepayment fees were at higher than normal levels. TRAVELERS ACQUISITION On January 31, 2005, MetLife announced that it would finance its planned $11.5 billion purchase of Travelers Life & Annuity and substantially all of Citigroup's international insurance businesses with a variety of financial instruments. MetLife now expects to finance the acquisition as follows: 3
MetLife's final financing plan for the transaction will depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, timing and valuation considerations. A registration statement relating to the securities described above has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not become effective. Securities may not be sold and offers to buy may not be accepted prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective. Any offering of securities covered by the registration statement will be made only by means of written prospectuses and prospectus supplements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. Earnings Conference Call - ------------------------ MetLife will hold its first quarter earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Wednesday, May 4, 2005, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET). The conference call will be available live via telephone and the Internet. To listen over the telephone, dial (612) 326-1003 (domestic and international callers). To listen to the conference call over the Internet, visit www.metlife.com (through a link on the Investor Relations page). Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures - ---------------------------------------- MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, the impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. 4
(1) Net investment gains (losses), net of income taxes, include gains (losses) on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $12 million and $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net investment gains (losses), net of income taxes, exclude gains of $16 million and $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. (2) Adjustments related to net investment gains (losses), net of income taxes, include amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, adjustments related to the policyholder dividend obligation and amounts allocable to certain participating contracts. (3) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2004 relates to the adoption of AICPA Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non-Traditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts. In this release, MetLife provides guidance on its future earnings per share on an operating, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. This release contains statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries, as well as other statements including words such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the company. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to the following: (i) changes in general 5
economic conditions, including the performance of financial markets and interest rates; (ii) heightened competition, including with respect to pricing, entry of new competitors and the development of new products by new and existing competitors; (iii) unanticipated changes in industry trends; (iv) the company's primary reliance, as a holding company, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations and the applicable regulatory restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends; (v) deterioration in the experience of the "closed block" established in connection with the reorganization of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; (vi) catastrophe losses; (vii) adverse results or other consequences from litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations; (viii) regulatory, accounting or tax changes that may affect the cost of, or demand for, the company's products or services; (ix) downgrades in the company's and its affiliates' claims paying ability, financial strength or credit ratings; (x) changes in rating agency policies or practices; (xi) discrepancies between actual claims experience and assumptions used in setting prices for the company's products and establishing the liabilities for the company's obligations for future policy benefits and claims; (xii) discrepancies between actual experience and assumptions used in establishing liabilities related to other contingencies or obligations; (xiii) the effects of business disruption or economic contraction due to terrorism or other hostilities; (xiv) the company's ability to identify and consummate on successful terms any future acquisitions, and to successfully integrate acquired businesses with minimal disruption; and (xv) other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its S-1 and S-3 registration statements. The company specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
