EXHIBIT 99.1 PUBLIC RELATIONS MetLife, Inc. For Immediate Release One MetLife Plaza 27-01 Queens Plaza North Long Island City, NY 11101 [METLIFE LOGO] Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2005 RESULTS GAINS ON REAL ESTATE SALES CONTRIBUTE TO RECORD NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE OF $3.02 REPORTS RECORD OPERATING EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $1.17, A 16% INCREASE NEW YORK, July 28, 2005 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported second quarter 2005 net income of $2.2 billion, or $3.02 per diluted common share, compared with $954 million, or $1.26 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2004. (1) $1.2 billion, net of income taxes, in gains on the sale of real estate are included in net income for the three months ended June 30, 2005. (2) Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings per diluted common share and book value per diluted common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income per diluted common share) are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to GAAP measures in this press release are provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section below, as well as in the tables that accompany this release.
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS - - Achieved record quarterly net income of $2.2 billion, which includes $1.2 billion of net investment gains, net of income taxes, from the sale of real estate - - Earned total premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year period - - Continued strong investment spreads "MetLife delivered outstanding results as we achieved record net income and operating earnings available to common shareholders for the second consecutive quarter," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Our diverse institutional and retail businesses in the U.S. and abroad continued to deliver strong, top-line results. In addition to leveraging the benefits of the Travelers acquisition, we are well positioned to expand our customer base by offering a variety of financial products, services and solutions that build financial freedom." Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2005 were $869 million, or $1.17 per diluted common share, compared with $766 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share, for the prior year period. SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings available to common shareholders are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 13% Institutional Business operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 were $358 million, compared with $317 million in the prior year period. The improvement in earnings was primarily due to retirement & savings, which experienced strong interest spreads, and the non-medical & health business, which had favorable underwriting results. This was partially offset by a higher than normal level of large group life claims. Operating earnings in the prior year period benefited from a $31 million reduction, net of income taxes, to a previously established premium tax liability in group life. During the quarter, group life premiums, fees and other revenues grew 8% over the prior year period primarily due to growth from sales, strong retention and favorable renewal activity on large participating business. Retirement & savings net investment income grew 22% compared to the prior year period largely due to higher corporate joint venture income and an increase in the asset base driven by favorable sales, particularly in guaranteed interest contracts and the structured settlement business. Non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues increased 15% over the prior year period due to continued growth across all product lines, particularly in the disability, long-term care and dental businesses. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 28% Individual Business operating earnings were $278 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $217 million in the prior year period. Results in Individual Business were driven primarily by growth in the annuity business and higher interest spreads. Traditional life results reflected the continuing decline in revenues from the company's closed block business while variable/universal life results were up over the prior year period primarily due to growth in the business. Fees 2
for the investment-type products within the annuity business increased by 27% compared with the prior year period. Traditional life first year premiums and deposits were up 11%, driven by higher term life sales. Declines in variable/universal life premiums and deposits were driven by lackluster interest in variable life products and a decrease in high initial premium universal life sales. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS UP 42% Auto & Home operating earnings were $101 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $71 million in the prior year period. Auto & Home's record results during the quarter benefited from an improved non-catastrophe combined ratio (86.4%), which resulted from lower homeowners claim frequencies, moderate auto claim severity, and favorable claim development related to prior accident years. Catastrophes for the second quarter of 2005 were also unusually low. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 22% International operating earnings were $50 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $41 million in the prior year period. Overall business growth in Latin America and Asia contributed to the segment's growth during the quarter. INVESTMENTS During the second quarter of 2005, the company completed the sale of One Madison Avenue and 200 Park Avenue in New York City. Combined, the sales resulted in a net investment gain of $1.2 billion, net of income taxes. During the quarter, derivative gains, net of income taxes, of $249 million were primarily related to interest rate and foreign currency movements on positions which did not qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, variable income was at higher than normal levels, primarily from corporate joint ventures. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On July 1, 2005, MetLife completed its acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity and substantially all of Citigroup's international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion. As part of the consideration, the company issued $1 billion in MetLife common stock, valued at $44.57 per common share, to Citigroup. Earnings Conference Call MetLife will hold its second quarter earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Friday, July 29, 2005, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET). The conference call will be available live via telephone and the Internet. To listen over the telephone, dial (612) 326-1003 (domestic and international callers). To listen to the conference call over the Internet, visit www.metlife.com (through a link on the Investor Relations page). Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings per diluted common share. Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, the impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations, net of income taxes. 3
Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends. Operating earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income per diluted common share, respectively. (1) Net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, includes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $(1,219) million and $(85) million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively and excludes (gains) losses of $(8) million and $(14) million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. (2) Adjustments related to net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, include amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation and amounts allocable to certain participating contracts. (3) Excludes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations. 4

(2) Adjustments related to net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, includes amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation and amounts allocable to certain participating contracts. (3) The cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, for the six months ended June 30, 2004, is in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non-Traditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.
