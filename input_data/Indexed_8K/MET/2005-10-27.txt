PUBLIC RELATIONS METLIFE, INC. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NEWS ONE METLIFE PLAZA 27-01 QUEENS PLAZA NORTH LONG ISLAND CITY, NY 11101 METLIFE [SNOOPY GRAPHIC] Contacts: For Media: For Investors: John Calagna Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-6252 (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2005 RESULTS - -NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $0.97 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE- - OPERATING EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $1.01 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, A 23% INCREASE - NEW YORK, October 27, 2005 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported third quarter 2005 net income available to common shareholders of $742 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share, compared with $695 million, or $0.92 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2004. (1) Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and book value per diluted common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Information
regarding non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the reconciliation of them to GAAP measures are provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section below, as well as in the tables that accompany this release. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS - - Achieved quarterly net income available to common shareholders of $742 million - - Earned total premiums, fees and other revenues of $8 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period - - Reached $483 billion in assets under management - - Completed acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity and substantially all of Citigroup's international insurance businesses on July 1, which contributed approximately 10% to operating earnings available to common shareholders, excluding integration and related expenses for the quarter "During the third quarter of 2005, MetLife continued to deliver overall strong results reflecting, in part, an important contribution from the businesses we acquired as a result of the Travelers transaction. We remain on track to complete the integration of the Travelers business by November 1," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "We have been extremely effective over the past few months integrating Travelers, while maintaining intense focus on achieving our overall financial objectives. This focus, along with the 2005 annual dividend we announced earlier this week, further demonstrates our commitment to providing value to MetLife's shareholders and fulfilling the promises we continue to make to our customers." Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2005 were $780 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share, compared with $618 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, for the prior year period. ESTIMATED KATRINA LOSSES MetLife estimates that the company's total net losses from Hurricane Katrina, which impacted the Auto & Home and Institutional (primarily disability business) segments, will be $130 million, net of income taxes and reinsurance recoverables and including premiums related to the catastrophe, or $0.17 per diluted common share. MetLife estimates its gross losses from Katrina to be approximately $340 million, primarily arising from the company's homeowners business. THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income available to common shareholders to segment operating earnings available to common shareholders are provided in the tables that accompany this release. During the quarter, MetLife had integration-related expenses of $38 million and recorded an accrual of $75 million for an employee bonus tied to the timely completion of the Travelers integration. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 30% Institutional Business operating earnings available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2005 were $386 million, compared with $298 million in the prior year period. Strong growth in the asset base for retirement & savings, due in large part to the Travelers acquisition, as well as higher net investment income, contributed to the earnings growth in the segment. In addition, non-medical health & other earnings increased 39%, primarily due to business growth across the majority of products. This includes a $12 million increase, net of income taxes, in disability benefits related to Hurricane Katrina. 2
During the quarter, group life premiums, fees and other revenues grew 16% over the prior year period primarily due to sales growth and favorable renewal activity, including a substantial, one-time premium on a large participating contract. Retirement & savings net investment income grew 61% compared to the prior year period largely due to the Travelers acquisition, higher corporate joint venture income and an increase in the asset base driven by favorable guaranteed interest contract sales. Non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues increased 13% over the prior year period due to continued growth across all product lines. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 66% Individual Business operating earnings available to common shareholders were $331 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $200 million in the prior year period. The strong growth in the segment was driven by the Travelers acquisition, as well as continued growth in the business. Traditional life results benefited from strong investment performance and favorable mortality in the open block of business. Fees for the investment-type products within the annuity business doubled compared with the prior year period as a result of growth in the separate account assets. Annuity results also benefited from strong investment performance. Traditional life first year premiums and deposits were up 18%, driven by higher term life sales. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS The Auto & Home segment reported an operating loss of $26 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared with operating earnings available to common shareholders of $34 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, the segment had catastrophe losses of $130 million, net of income taxes and reinsurance recoverables and including premiums related to the catastrophes. These losses were primarily due to Hurricane Katrina ($116 million, net of income taxes and reinsurance recoverables and including premiums related to the catastrophe) and Hurricanes Rita and Ophelia ($6 million, net of income taxes). While the homeowners business was significantly impacted by hurricanes, earnings in the auto business increased 25%. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 40% International operating earnings available to common shareholders were $66 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $47 million in the prior year period. Earnings in this segment increased due in part to a one-time $15 million tax benefit, as well as continued business growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. INVESTMENTS During the third quarter of 2005, variable income was at higher than normal levels, primarily from corporate joint ventures. EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL MetLife will hold its third quarter earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Friday, October 28, 2005, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET). The conference call will be available live via telephone and the Internet. To listen over the telephone, dial (612) 326-1003 (domestic and international callers).

NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, the impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. 4
