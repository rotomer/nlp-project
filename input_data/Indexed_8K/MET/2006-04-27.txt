(NYSE: MET) today reported first quarter 2006 net income available to common shareholders of $714 million, or $0.93 per diluted common share, compared with $987 million, or $1.33 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2005. (1) Operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and book value per diluted common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the reconciliation of them to GAAP measures are provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section below, as well as in the tables that accompany this release. 1
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS - - Earned total premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.9 billion, a 12% increase over the prior year period - - Annuity deposits in the United States reached a record $3.8 billion, an increase of 51% over the prior year period - - Total assets increased to approximately $500 billion - - Continued strong investment results Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2006 were $1,025 million, or $1.33 per diluted common share, compared with $822 million, or $1.11 per diluted common share, for the prior year period. "MetLife had a very strong first quarter as operating earnings available to common shareholders reached a record $1 billion," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "During the quarter, we continued to see the benefits of the Travelers acquisition, which added to our strong and diverse product portfolio and broad distribution capabilities. Already the leader in a number of markets, MetLife is well positioned to continue growing our core businesses as we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and delivering value to shareholders." EARNINGS GUIDANCE In light of the company's strong performance in the first quarter of 2006 and anticipated strong results for the remainder of the year, MetLife also announced today that it is revising its previously announced full year 2006 operating earnings guidance from $4.25 to $4.50 per common share to between $4.55 and $4.75 per common share. FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income available to common shareholders to segment operating earnings available to common shareholders are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 28% Institutional Business operating earnings available to common shareholders in the first quarter of 2006 were $416 million, compared with $324 million in the prior year period, which includes the impact of the Travelers acquisition and favorable investment and expense results across Institutional Business. Retirement & savings earnings increased 58% over the prior year period due in large part to the acquisition of Travelers, favorable investment results and an increase in earnings from underwriting. Group life earnings were down slightly versus the year ago period. Favorable expense results were offset by slightly lower investment earnings. Underwriting results were in line with the previous year period. Earnings in the non-medical health & other segment were up 3%, driven by favorable investment and expense results, partially offset by lower earnings from underwriting. 2
Non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues increased 12% over the prior year period, reflecting continued strong growth across all product lines. Group life premiums, fees, and other revenues grew by 13% over the prior year period. Underlying business growth driven by favorable retention of existing customers was the primary driver of the increase. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 27% Individual Business operating earnings available to common shareholders were $408 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $321 million in the prior year period. The strong growth in the segment was due to Travelers as well as continued growth in the business. Fees for investment-type products within the annuity business increased 92% compared with the prior year period as a result of growth in the separate account assets. Annuity earnings increased 54% over the prior year period as results continued to benefit from strong investment performance and spread management. In addition, combined life earnings were up 6% due to growth in the business, partially offset by unfavorable mortality. During the quarter, annuity deposits increased 51% over the prior year period to reach a record $3.8 billion. In addition, total first year life premiums and deposits increased nearly 50%, reflecting broader distribution resulting from the Travelers acquisition and a growing agency sales force. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS UP 22% Auto & Home operating earnings available to common shareholders were $93 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $76 million in the prior year period. Auto & Home's strong results were due to an improved combined ratio of 89.6%, which resulted from lower automobile claim frequencies, moderate auto claim severity and $9 million, net of income taxes, in favorable claim development related to prior accident years in the first quarter of 2006. Mild weather conditions in the Northeast during the first quarter contributed to the excellent claim experience. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 10% International operating earnings available to common shareholders were $75 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $68 million in the prior year period. Earnings in this segment increased due to unusually strong business performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America. STRONG INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE During the first quarter of 2006, MetLife's investment results continued to be strong, enhanced by sustained solid performance in corporate joint ventures. The company undertook a strategic repositioning of its investment portfolio during the quarter to take advantage of rising interest rates. This repositioning, while enhancing the portfolio, contributed to higher net realized losses, net of income taxes, of $406 million. Also included in this result were derivative losses, net of income taxes, of $164 million. The company's derivative positions provide MetLife with protection against interest rate and currency movements and the losses related to positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. 4
(1) Net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, includes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $3 million and $(12) million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and excludes (gains) losses of $(25) million and $(16) million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. (2) Adjustments related to net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, include amortization of unearned revenue and deferred policy acquisition costs, adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation and amounts allocable to certain participating contracts. (3) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes, excludes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations.
