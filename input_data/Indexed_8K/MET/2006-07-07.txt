METLIFE COMMENTS ON CITIGROUP'S SALE OF SHARES NEW YORK, July 7, 2006 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced today that it has been informed by Citigroup Inc. that Citigroup has sold to an unaffiliated broker-dealer all of the 22,436,617 shares of MetLife common stock that Citigroup had received in the July 1, 2005 sale of Travelers Life & Annuity and substantially all of Citigroup's international insurance businesses to MetLife. Citigroup further informed MetLife that all of the MetLife shares were delivered to the third-party broker-dealer today pursuant to certain forward contracts entered into by Citigroup and the broker-dealer previously. Because MetLife believes that the broker-dealer had previously engaged in hedging activities with respect to a substantial portion or more of the shares, the sale of these shares to the broker-dealer should not result in a material increase in the net supply of MetLife shares into the market. MetLife, Inc. is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to millions of individual and institutional customers throughout the United States. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife, Inc. offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowner's insurance and retail banking services to individuals, as well as group insurance, reinsurance and retirement and savings products and services to corporations and other institutions. Outside the U.S., the MetLife companies have direct insurance operations in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe. For more information, please visit www.metlife.com.
