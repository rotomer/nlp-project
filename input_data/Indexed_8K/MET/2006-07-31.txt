Exhibit 99.1 Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2006 RESULTS - REPORTS NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $0.80 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE - - REPORTS OPERATING EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $1.28 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, A 9% INCREASE - NEW YORK, July 31, 2006 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported second quarter 2006 net income available to common shareholders of $617 million, or $0.80 per diluted common share, compared with $2.2 billion, or $3.02 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, net income available to common shareholders included a net investment gain of $1.2 billion, net of income taxes, due to the sale of real estate. (1) Operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and book value per diluted common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the reconciliation of them to GAAP measures are provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section below, as well as in the tables that accompany this release. 1
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS - - Earned total premiums, fees and other revenues of $8 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year period - - Annuity deposits in the United States reached a record $4.2 billion, an increase of 69% over the prior year period - - Achieved record operating earnings available to common shareholders in Institutional Business Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2006 were $982 million, or $1.28 per diluted common share, compared with $870 million, or $1.17 per diluted common share, for the prior year period. "In the second quarter, MetLife once again demonstrated its ability to achieve strong results. Total premiums, fees and other revenues increased 11% and total annuity deposits increased 69% over the prior year period as our expanded independent distribution group continues to improve our market position," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Each of our core businesses continues to grow, capitalizing on MetLife's experience and breadth of product offerings." SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income available to common shareholders to segment operating earnings available to common shareholders are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 31% Institutional Business operating earnings available to common shareholders in the second quarter of 2006 were a record $453 million, compared with $346 million in the prior year period. The segment's strong performance during the quarter was due in large part to favorable underwriting results in the group life business, strong performance among the products in the non-medical health & other business as well as favorable investment results in the retirement & savings business. Group life earnings were up 67% over the prior year period due to strong underwriting results and continued favorable persistency. In addition, group life premiums, fees, and other revenues grew slightly over the prior year period. Retirement & savings earnings grew 6% compared with the second quarter of 2005. Favorable investment results and growth in the asset base, due primarily to the Travelers acquisition, were partially offset by a charge of $11 million, net of income taxes, associated with costs related to the sale of certain small market recordkeeping businesses. Retirement & savings net investment income was up 47% due in large part to the Travelers acquisition. 2
Non-medical health & other earnings increased 72% due to favorable results across most product lines and slightly lower expenses. Non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues were up 9% over the prior year period, reflecting growth across most product lines. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 22% Individual Business operating earnings available to common shareholders were $353 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared with $290 million in the prior year period. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by the Travelers acquisition. Annuity earnings increased 18% over the prior year period as results benefited from strong growth in the business, including the addition of Travelers. During the quarter, annuity deposits increased 69% over the prior year period to reach a record $4.2 billion, reflecting the successful integration of the distribution channels acquired through the Travelers acquisition and the introduction of new products and riders. As a result, fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business increased 85% compared with the prior year period. Earnings in the traditional life business were up 45% due primarily to favorable mortality and a one-time post-retirement benefit liability release. Total first year life premiums and deposits increased 35%, reflecting broader distribution resulting from the Travelers acquisition and a growing agency force. Variable/universal life earnings increased 10% over the prior year period. In addition, MetLife has completed its previously announced review of Travelers underwriting on specific blocks of life policies and has determined that an additional $30 million, net of income taxes, of excess mortality reserves was required for these policies. This resulted in a charge of $21 million, net of income taxes, primarily to variable/universal life earnings. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS REMAIN STRONG Auto & Home operating earnings available to common shareholders remained strong at $99 million in the second quarter of 2006. This compared with a record $101 million in the prior year period, which benefited from unusually low catastrophes. Auto & Home's strong performance in the quarter resulted in an improved non-catastrophe combined ratio of 84.5%, which was due to lower automobile claim frequencies and $21 million, net of income taxes, in favorable claim development related to prior accident years. In addition, earned premiums in the second quarter of 2006 were impacted by higher reinsurance costs. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 22% International operating earnings available to common shareholders were $62 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared with $51 million in the prior year period. Earnings in the segment benefited from strong performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America. 3
INVESTMENTS During the second quarter of 2006, MetLife's investment results were enhanced by sustained, solid performance in corporate joint ventures. The company took advantage of higher interest rates and wider spreads during the second quarter to enhance the portfolio, which contributed to higher net realized investment losses, net of income taxes, of $524 million. Included in this result were derivative losses, net of income taxes, of $233 million. The company's derivative positions provide MetLife with protection against interest rate and currency movements and the losses related to positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Earnings Conference Call MetLife will hold its second quarter 2006 earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Tuesday, August 1, 2006, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET).

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common 4
share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. (1) Net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, includes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $2 million and $(1,227) million for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and excludes (gains) losses of $(44) million and $(8) million for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. (2) Adjustments related to net investment (gains) losses, net of income taxes, include amortization of unearned revenue and deferred policy acquisition costs, adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation and amounts allocable to certain participating contracts. (3) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes, excludes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations.

NOTE: The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.
