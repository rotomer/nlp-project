Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2006 RESULTS - REPORTS NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $1.29 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, A 33% INCREASE - - REPORTS OPERATING EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $1.24 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, A 23% INCREASE - NEW YORK, October 30, 2006 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported third quarter 2006 net income available to common shareholders of $999 million, or $1.29 per diluted common share, compared with $742 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2005. (1) Operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and book value per diluted common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the reconciliation of them to GAAP measures are provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section below, as well as in the tables that accompany this release. 1
HIGHLIGHTS - - Earned record total premiums, fees and other revenues of $8.1 billion - - Reached $516.2 billion in total assets - - Announced the sale of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2006 were $958 million, or $1.24 per diluted common share, compared with $780 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share, for the prior year period. "MetLife continued to benefit from our diverse businesses in the third quarter with strong underlying fundamentals in all segments and record quarterly results in Auto & Home," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "We are pleased to continue providing value to our shareholders with the recently announced 13% increase in the annual common stock dividend. In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program and remain focused on continuing our strong momentum to achieve our objectives for 2006." THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income available to common shareholders to segment operating earnings available to common shareholders are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS REMAIN STRONG Institutional Business operating earnings available to common shareholders in the third quarter of 2006 remained strong at $390 million, compared with $386 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, solid growth in non-medical health & other earnings was partially offset by the impact of lower interest spreads in the retirement & savings business. Non-medical health & other earnings increased 29% due to growth in the business and favorable underwriting results across the major product lines. Non-medical health & other premiums, fees and other revenues were up 9% over the prior year period, reflecting growth across all product lines, especially in dental and disability. Retirement & savings earnings, while benefiting from certain lower expenses, were down 7% compared with the third quarter of 2005, primarily due to the impact of lower interest spreads, driven by the inverted yield curve, and lower variable net investment income. During the quarter, the general and separate account assets for retirement & savings reached a combined record of $114.6 billion. Group life earnings of $101 million were relatively flat compared with the prior year period. Underlying growth in the business, lower expenses and favorable underwriting results were offset by the impact of lower interest spreads. 2
INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 11% Individual Business operating earnings available to common shareholders were $367 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared with $330 million in the prior year period. This increase was due, in part, to growth in the business and favorable underwriting results, partially offset by lower variable net investment income. Total life earnings increased 11% over the prior year period as the business benefited from good mortality and a $12 million benefit from a specific reserve reduction. A strong increase in variable & universal life earnings was partially offset by a decline in traditional life results, which was primarily driven by lower variable net investment income and higher expenses. Total life first year premiums and deposits, as expected, were down compared to the prior year period due to a decline in sales in the independent channel. Annuity earnings increased 11% over the prior year period as results benefited from growth in the business. While variable net investment income decreased from unusually high levels in the prior year period, annuity spreads remained strong. During the quarter, total annuity deposits were $3.5 billion and fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business increased 15% compared with the prior year period. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS REACH NEW RECORD Auto & Home operating earnings available to common shareholders were a record $107 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared with an operating loss of $26 million in the prior year period. Auto & Home's strong performance in the quarter was due in part to significantly lower catastrophes compared with the prior year period. In addition, the non-catastrophe combined ratio improved to 81.2%, reflecting $27 million, net of income taxes, in favorable claim development related to prior accident years and good claim frequencies in both the auto and homeowners businesses. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 9% International operating earnings available to common shareholders were $72 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared with $66 million in the prior year period. Earnings in the segment benefited from solid performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America. In Japan, MSI MetLife continued its strong performance with sales of $1.5 billion, up 12% over the prior year period on a yen basis. INVESTMENTS MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results as the net investment income yield increased to 6.32% in the third quarter of 2006, compared with 6.17% in the prior year period. Variable net investment income, while on plan, was lower than the prior year period. On October 17, 2006, MetLife announced the sale of its Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties for $5.4 billion. The sale is expected to result in a gain of approximately $3 billion, net of income taxes. It is anticipated that the sale will close in the fourth quarter of 2006, subject to customary closing conditions. 3
CORPORATE EVENTS Share Repurchase - ---------------- MetLife announced today that it intends to resume its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2006. The company currently has $716 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization. Earnings Conference Call - ------------------------ MetLife will hold its third quarter 2006 earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Tuesday, October 31, 2006, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET).

To access the replay of the conference call over the Internet, visit the above-mentioned Web site. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures - ---------------------------------------- MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. 4

(3) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes, excludes (gains) losses from discontinued operations related to real estate and real estate joint ventures.

NOTE: The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.
