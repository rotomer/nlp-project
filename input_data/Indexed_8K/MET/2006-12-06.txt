Michael J. Vietri is executive vice president of MetLife's agency distribution group. In this role, he oversees approximately 8,000 sales people from the MetLife career agency and New England Financial general agency distribution channels. He was named the head of the MetLife sales force in August 2004 and received added responsibility for New England Financial in April 2005.
Mike is responsible for the strategic direction of the sales force as it ties to the company's overall business sales, recruitment, retention, business goals and expense management. He successfully completed the restructuring of a number of MetLife sales offices from approximately 600 to 102, as well as led the two-year initiative to do the same for New England Financial (83 to 46 offices).
At the same time, he focused on increasing per agency production by developing the resources to strengthen the agencies' infrastructure and reducing the expense gap. Retention of top sales producers continues to be a key objective. Year-to-date 2006, four-year retention is more than double the industry. Through October 2006, the first year gross dealer concession per representative is up 6% over prior year.
Mike continues to focus on recruiting a diverse sales force. New rep appointments are up 3%  of which 26% are multicultural and 28% are women. Initiatives such as MetLife's partnership with The American College to provide internships and financial services class work to college sophomores and juniors is gaining momentum, as well as the women's sales symposiums to gain new recruits and provide training opportunities to the sales people already at MetLife. Also, Mike created top producer advisory councils, focusing on key demographics including African American, Hispanic, Chinese, South Asian and women, for financial education, as well as recruitment and retention. From the African American advisory council came MetLife's partnership with The American College for "Strategies to Be a Successful African American Financial Services Professional," a unique seminar focused on training and networking for African American financial services representatives from MetLife and other companies. Other initiatives in 2006 include redesigning and standardizing sales compensation in terms of gross dealer commissions, as well as revising the way in which new hires are financially supported.
Mike joined MetLife as a financial services representative, then managed a sales agency before becoming a regional vice president in 1986. In 1990, Mike was appointed marketing vice present in the Northeastern territory and territorial vice present of the Mid-America territory in 1991, before becoming senior vice present of the North Central zone in 1999, which included 12 states and two regional offices with more than 1,700 producers. The zone accounted for 31% of the company's total sales force and 32% of total sales. It was in this role that he developed programs that are used today to train and provide networking opportunities for women.
Mike earned his chartered life underwriter designation from The American College, where he now serves on the board of trustees, as well as the finance and marketing committees. Mike is a member of the General Agents & Managers Association (GAMA) and is involved in a number of industry associations. He has been a main platform speaker at key trade events.
