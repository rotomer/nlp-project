Exhibit 1.1 METLIFE, INC. UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT December 14, 2006 To the Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the respective Pricing Agreements hereinafter described Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time, MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "PRICING AGREEMENT") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (the "UNDERWRITERS" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) the principal amount of its securities or aggregate number of shares identified in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (the "SECURITIES" with respect to such Pricing Agreement). The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Subordinated Indenture as specified in such Pricing Agreement, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, (the Subordinated Indenture as so supplemented, the "INDENTURE"), or the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (including the applicable Certificate of Designation), as applicable (each, a "SECURITIES AGREEMENT"), and identified in such Pricing Agreement. Particular sales of Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "REPRESENTATIVES"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Securities or the total number of shares, as the case may be, the initial public offering price of such Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount or number of shares, as the case may be, of such Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter. In addition, such Pricing Agreement shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Securities and payment therefor. Such Pricing Agreement shall also specify (in a manner not inconsistent with the applicable Securities Agreements and the registration
statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Underwriting Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree that any representation and/or warranty by any of the parties hereto, concerning the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet and/or the General Disclosure Package (each, as defined below) shall be deemed to have been made as of the Applicable Time (as defined below). 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to the Underwriters, and agrees with each of the Underwriters, as follows: (a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-124358) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT"), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the Securities. The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Act. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a supplement or supplements to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Securities and the plan of distribution thereof. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"; the Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "ORIGINAL REGISTRATION STATEMENT"; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Original Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "BASE PROSPECTUS"; and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it shall first be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 (including the Base Prospectus as so supplemented), is hereinafter called the "FINAL PROSPECTUS." Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has heretofore been filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called a "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS."

to Rule 424 under the Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the Act and the rules thereunder and each Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus delivered to the Representatives for use in connection with this offering was identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval ("EDGAR") system, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (b) (i) The Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and, in the case of Securities issued pursuant to an Indenture, such Indenture, will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TRUST INDENTURE ACT"), as applicable, and the respective rules thereunder; (ii) Each Preliminary Prospectus complied when so filed in all material respects with the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act (the "1933 ACT REGULATIONS"); (iii) The Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to each part of the Registration Statement and as of the applicable filing date as to the Final Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the trustee's Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; and (iv) As of the Applicable Time, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es) (as defined below) listed on Schedule 1(a) hereto, if any, the Pricing Prospectus (as defined below), and the final term sheet relating to the securities set forth on Annex IV (the "FINAL TERM SHEET"), all considered together (collectively, the "GENERAL DISCLOSURE PACKAGE"), did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Delivery and Payment. Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in definitive form to the extent practicable, and in such 10
authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter at the office, on the date and at the time specified in the applicable Pricing Agreement (or such later date not later than five business days after such specified date as the Representatives shall designate), which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 8 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "CLOSING DATE"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Underwriters for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Representatives of the purchase price thereof by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company or as otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Agreement. 4. Company Covenants. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Securities: (a) To prepare the Final Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file timely such Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act; to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Securities and prior to the Closing Date for such Securities unless the Representatives for such Securities shall have had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such amendment or supplement prior to any filing thereof; to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Final Prospectus or any amended Final Prospectus has been filed and to furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities and, during such same period, to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of (i) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of the Final Prospectus, (ii) the suspension of the qualification of such Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or (iii) any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of the Final Prospectus or suspending any such qualification, promptly to use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; (b) To give the Representatives notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act or the regulations of the Commission thereunder within forty-eight hours prior to the Applicable Time; to give the Representatives notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Time and to furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing. The Company will prepare the Final Term Sheet and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prior to the close of business two business days after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representatives with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a 11
reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall object; (c) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for so long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation, to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise subject; (d) To furnish to the Representatives a copy of each proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company and not to use or refer to any proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to which the Representatives reasonably object; if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, to promptly notify the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, to promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission; provided, however, that this covenant shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein; (e) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities, and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus were delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or a supplement to the Final Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Representatives shall be identical to the electronically 12
transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T; (f) To make generally available to securityholders of the Company as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); (g) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for any Securities and continuing to and including the Closing Date for such Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to offer or sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company having pricing characteristics similar to the Securities exceeding an aggregate principal amount of $3 billion less the gross proceeds from the sale of the Securities without the prior written consent of the Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (h) During a period of five years from the effective date of the Registration Statement, to furnish to the Representatives copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders of the Company, and to furnish to the Representatives as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Securities or any class of securities of the Company is listed (such financial statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission), provided that reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission, and publicly available on EDGAR, or furnished on the Company's website, shall be deemed to have been furnished to the Representatives under this Section 4(h); and (i) The Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Final Term Sheet filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto). Each Underwriter agrees, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) under the Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder but for the action of such Underwriter (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Final Term Sheet filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto). Any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives, is listed on Schedule 1 hereto. 5. Fees and Expenses. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel and accountants to the Company in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the 13
preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Securities Agreement, any Agreement among Underwriters, any Blue Sky Survey and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws and insurance securities laws as provided in Section 4(b) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky Survey; (iv) the filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, securing any required review by the NASD of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (v) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of any trustee, paying agent or transfer agent and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any such trustee, paying agent or transfer agent in connection with a Securities Agreement and the Securities issued pursuant to any Securities Agreement; (viii) any travel expenses of the Company's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of the Securities; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. Except as provided in this Section, and Sections 7 and 10 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, stock transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers of the Securities that they may make. 6. Conditions to Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein or in certificates of any officer of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof are, at and as of the Closing Date true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder and under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities to be performed at or before the Closing Date, and the following additional conditions.

such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Richard S. Collins, Chief Counsel - General Corporate, of the Company, shall have furnished to the Underwriters his written opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex V; (d) The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives reasonably request; (e) (i) On the date hereof, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date hereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants with respect to the Company and the Company's subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder, and further to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto and (ii) on the Closing Date for the applicable Securities, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of delivery thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you, that reaffirms the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to subclause (i) of that section, except that the specified date referred to shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Date; (f) The Underwriters shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP (and furnished to you in form and substance satisfactory to you) a review report with respect to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company," as set forth in the Company's 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagement No. 10 issued by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; (g) Neither the Company nor any Significant Subsidiary shall have sustained (i) since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package, there shall not have been any change in the surplus of MetLife or the capital stock of the Company or any increase in the long-term debt of the Company and its respective subsidiaries considered as a whole, or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the applicable Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectus; (h) At or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the debt securities of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or the financial 15

(m) LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Underwriters their written opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex VI. 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (i) the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any Preliminary Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus set forth on Schedule 1(a) or 1(b) attached hereto (each, a "COVERED ISSUER FREE WRITING PROSPECTUS") or the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Covered Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement(s) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of the applicable Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein. (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Covered Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement, or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged 17
omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Covered Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or 18
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the applicable Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus relating to the applicable Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of the applicable Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 19
8. Defaulting Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of any defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, which remains unpurchased does not exceed ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as applicable, to be purchased on such Closing Date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of Securities, as applicable, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of Securities, as applicable, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, which remains unpurchased exceeds ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution 20
agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 9. Offering Restrictions. Each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, any of the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees as set forth in Annex III to this Agreement. 10. Survival. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11. Effect of Termination of Pricing Agreement or Nondelivery of Securities. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of such Securities except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof. 12. Reliance upon Representatives.
