NEW YORK, February 13, 2007  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported record fourth quarter 2006 net income available to common shareholders of $3.8 billion, or $4.95 per diluted common share, compared with $677 million, or $0.88 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2005. MetLife also reported that net income available to common shareholders for 2006 was a record $6.2 billion, or $7.99 per diluted common share, compared with $4.7 billion, or $6.16 per diluted common share, for 2005.
 
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $1.1 billion, or $1.36 per diluted common share, compared with $799 million, or $1.04 per diluted common share, for the prior year period.
"MetLife had a great quarter as total revenues reached a record level and operating earnings available to common shareholders increased 32% over the prior year period," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Total assets grew 10% over the fourth quarter of 2005. We continue to focus on growing our core businesses as we capitalize on our broad distribution reach to provide competitive products to both our institutional and individual clients."
Full Year Highlights
Operating earnings available to common shareholders for 2006 were $4.0 billion, or $5.21 per diluted common share, compared with $3.3 billion, or $4.33 per diluted common share, for 2005.
"With a 23% increase in full year 2006 operating earnings available to common shareholders over 2005's results, MetLife delivered solid financial performance during the year. In addition to achieving record net income and operating earnings available to common shareholders during the year, we also continued to leverage our strong brand name and financial strength to solidify and grow our leading U.S. market positions while also expanding our businesses in several international markets," added Henrikson.
Reconciliations of segment net income available to common shareholders to segment operating earnings available to common shareholders are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Fourth Quarter Segment Overview
Institutional Business operating earnings available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $441 million, compared with $389 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, the segment delivered strong top line growth and also benefited from higher net investment income. The increase in earnings was slightly offset by a charge of $16 million, net of income tax, which represents costs associated with a previously announced regulatory settlement. This charge primarily impacted group life results.
Institutional Business Earnings up 13%
 
Retirement & savings earnings were up 30% compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily due to higher interest spreads. The business benefited from strong net investment income and a 7% increase in the general account asset base. During the quarter, the general account and separate account balances for retirement & savings reached a combined record of $117.6 billion.
Non-medical health & other earnings increased 21% due to growth in the business and favorable net investment income. Non-medical health & other premiums, fees and other revenues were up 8% over the prior year period, reflecting growth across all product lines, especially in dental and disability.
Group life earnings of $95 million were down compared with the prior year period. Underlying growth in the business and stronger interest spreads were offset by higher expenses, including the above-mentioned charge.
Individual Business operating earnings available to common shareholders were a record $415 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $312 million in the prior year period. This increase was due, in part, to growth in the business, strong net investment income and an increase of $35 million, net of income tax, due to deferred acquisition cost adjustments in the life and annuity businesses.
Individual Business Earnings up 33%
Total life earnings almost doubled compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 as the business benefited from favorable mortality and higher net investment income. Total life first year premiums and deposits were down compared with the prior year period due primarily to a decline in universal life sales in the independent channel.
Annuity earnings increased 10% over the prior year period, reflecting a 16% increase in separate account fees and wider general account spreads, which benefited from strong net investment income. Total annuity premiums and deposits were $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 and total annuity assets reached a record $127.2 billion.
Auto & Home operating earnings available to common shareholders were a record $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $81 million in the prior year period. Auto & Home's strong performance during the quarter was due to favorable claim development related to prior accident years of $52 million, net of income tax (compared to $18 million, net of income tax, in the prior year period), lower catastrophes compared with the prior year period and lower auto claim frequencies.
Auto & Home Earnings up 42%
International operating earnings available to common shareholders were $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $48 million in the prior year period. Operating earnings for the quarter were impacted by start-up expenses in the United Kingdom associated with the retail annuity business; a charge of $50 million, net of income tax, related to loss recognition in Taiwan due to the effects of a continuing low interest rate environment; and a charge of $11 million, net of income tax, related to the December 2006 closing of the agency distribution channel in Taiwan. These items were partially offset by an increase in earnings of $38 million, net of income tax, in South Korea resulting from the implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system.
International
During the quarter, the segment had solid growth in premiums, fees and other revenues. In Japan, MSI MetLife continued its strong performance with annuity sales of $1.6 billion, up 20% over the prior year period on a yen basis.
 
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter of 2006. Variable investment income was higher than expected and driven primarily by strong corporate joint venture income.
Investments
During the fourth quarter of 2006, MetLife completed the sale of its Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties for $5.4 billion. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $3 billion, net of income tax.
Corporate Events
Share Repurchase
For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, MetLife repurchased through its share repurchase program 8.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $500 million. A portion of the repurchases were made under an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, through which MetLife repurchased 4 million shares at a cost of $232 million. At December 31, 2006, MetLife had $216 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization. In February 2007, MetLife paid a cash adjustment related to the accelerated share repurchase of $8 million for a final purchase price of $240 million.
During the fourth quarter, MetLife made a $30 million contribution to MetLife Foundation, the company's non-profit organization. This item is recorded in Corporate & Other in other expenses.
MetLife Foundation Contribution
During the first quarter of 2007, MetLife will be adopting the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, which provides accounting guidance on deferred acquisition costs (DAC) associated with the replacement or significant modification of an insurance policy or annuity contract. The adoption is estimated to result in a reduction in DAC of between $275 million to $350 million, net of income tax, and will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. MetLife estimates that this adoption may result in a reduction to 2007 operating earnings of up to $35 million, net of income tax.
Statement of Position 05-1
MetLife will hold its fourth quarter 2006 earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Wednesday, February 14, 2007, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET).

MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
(1) Net investment (gains) losses, net of income tax, includes (gains) losses on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $(3,021) million and $(100) million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and excludes (gains) losses of $(56) million and $(23) million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment.
(2) Adjustments related to net investment (gains) losses, net of income tax, include amortization of unearned revenue and deferred policy acquisition costs, adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation and amounts allocable to certain participating contracts.
(3) Discontinued operations, net of income tax, excludes (gains) losses from discontinued operations related to real estate and real estate joint ventures.

NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income, operating earnings available to common shareholders to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share to GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release dated Feburary 13, 2007, for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, which are available at www.metlife.com.
