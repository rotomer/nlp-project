First Quarter Highlights
Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2007 were a record $1,082 million, or $1.41 per diluted common share, compared with $1,026 million, or $1.33 per diluted common share, for the prior year period.
"In addition to delivering record operating earnings in the first quarter, MetLife also achieved top-line growth and increased total assets in a challenging interest rate environment," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "MetLife continues to benefit from its diverse businesses, enabling us to focus on multiple opportunities to leverage our strong brand name and expand our leading positions in several markets. Our competitive products and high quality distribution channels will serve us well as we continue to provide financial solutions that meet the asset and income protection needs of individuals around the world."
First Quarter Segment Overview
Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Institutional Business Earnings of $452 Million, up 9%
Institutional Business operating earnings for the first quarter of 2007 were $452 million, compared with $416 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, the segment benefited from favorable underwriting results across all product lines, higher net investment income and top line growth. The earnings increase was partially offset by an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of approximately $18 million, net of income tax, due to a change in accounting rules required under AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1. This increased amortization impacted both group life and non-medical health & other results.
Group life earnings increased 18% over the prior year period to $107 million. Underlying growth in the business and favorable underwriting results were somewhat offset by the previously mentioned accounting change.
Retirement & savings earnings were $266 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared with $261 million in the prior year period. Strong net investment income and lower expenses drove the higher results. Retirement & savings total assets reached a combined record of $119.3 billion.
Non-medical health & other earnings increased 23% over the prior year period to $79 million due primarily to growth in the dental and disability businesses and favorable underwriting results. This was partially offset by the previously mentioned accounting change. Non-medical health & other premiums, fees and other revenues were up 11% over the prior year period, reflecting growth across all product lines, especially in dental and disability.
 
Individual Business Earnings of $319 Million
Individual Business operating earnings were $319 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared with $408 million in the prior year period. Underlying growth in the business was partially offset by a revision to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $40 million, net of income tax, in both the life and annuity businesses, as well as $22 million, net of income tax, in asset write-offs.
Total life earnings were down compared with the prior year period, reflecting the impact of a revision to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and higher expenses. Total life first year statutory premiums and deposits were down compared with the prior year period. Sales in the agency channel were up 6% and were more than offset by a decline in universal life sales in the independent channel.
Annuity earnings declined from the first quarter of 2006 due to the impact of a revision to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and higher expenses, which were partially offset by growth in the business. Total fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business increased 15% compared with the first quarter of 2006 to reach a record level. Total annuity statutory premiums and deposits were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2007. Variable annuity sales in the agency channel were up 4% over the prior year period and total annuity assets reached a record $128.3 billion.
Auto & Home Earnings of $106 Million, up 14%
Auto & Home operating earnings were $106 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared with $93 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, the segment benefited from favorable claim development related to prior accident years of $30 million, net of income tax, as well as lower catastrophes compared with the prior year period. In addition, non-catastrophe claim frequencies returned to more normal levels compared to the favorable levels in the prior year period, when weather conditions were relatively mild.
International Earnings a Record $124 Million, up 63%
International operating earnings were a record $124 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared with $76 million in the prior year period. International's strong performance during the quarter was due primarily to business growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. In addition, expense management positively impacted results along with $17 million, net of income tax, in one-time benefits related to tax benefits and experience premium reserve reductions.
During the quarter, International premiums, fees and other revenues grew 18% over the prior year period. In Japan, MSI MetLife achieved annuity sales of $1.6 billion, up 36% over the prior year period on a yen basis.
Investments
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2007. Before income tax and the impact of deferred policy acquisition costs, variable investment income was approximately $120 million higher than planned, driven primarily by strong corporate joint venture income.
 
Corporate Events
Share Repurchase
For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, MetLife repurchased, through its share repurchase program, 11.9 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $750 million under an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. At March 31, 2007, MetLife had $458 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization.
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
During the first quarter of 2007, MetLife adopted AICPA SOP 05-1, which provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred policy acquisition costs associated with the replacement or significant modification of an insurance policy or annuity contract. The adoption resulted in a reduction in deferred policy acquisition costs of $292 million, net of income tax, and was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The adoption also resulted in an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of approximately $18 million, net of income tax, to operating earnings in the first quarter.
In addition, during the quarter, MetLife adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in a company's financial statements. This adoption decreased retained earnings by $37 million, net of minority interest.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative
 
instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as net income and net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
