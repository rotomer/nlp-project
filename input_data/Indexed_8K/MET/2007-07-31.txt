Second Quarter Highlights
In the second quarter of 2007, MetLife achieved the following record results:
Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $1.3 billion, or $1.72 per diluted common share, compared with $984 million, or $1.28 per diluted common share, for the prior year period.
"MetLife had an outstanding second quarter as we again achieved record top- and bottom-line results, generated strong earnings in each of our businesses and reached new operating earnings records in our two largest businesses  Institutional and Individual," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "During the quarter, we also reached a new record in total assets, as well as in annuity deposits in the U.S. We continue to capitalize on shifting demographics and market trends, and I believe this is reflected in our strong results for the quarter."
As a result of MetLife's strong performance in the first half of 2007, the company also announced today that it is updating its previously announced full year 2007 operating earnings guidance to $5.65 to $5.80 per diluted common share from $5.05 to $5.30 per diluted common share.
Earnings Guidance
Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Second Quarter Segment Overview
Institutional Business operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were a record $521 million, compared with $453 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, the segment benefited from strong net investment income and excellent underwriting results across the businesses.
Institutional Business Earnings of $521 Million, up 15%
Group life earnings during the second quarter of 2007 remained strong at $142 million, up slightly from $139 million in the prior year period. Top-line growth, solid underwriting results and higher net investment income were somewhat offset by higher expenses, including $3 million, net of income tax, resulting from the adoption of AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1.
Retirement & savings earnings were $299 million in the second quarter of 2007, up 35% from the $221 million earned in the prior year period. Strong net investment income and favorable underwriting results drove the increase. In addition, retirement & savings' total assets reached a record of $124.4 billion.
 
Non-medical health & other earnings were $80 million during the second quarter of 2007, compared with $93 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 10% over the prior year period, reflecting growth across all product lines, especially in dental and disability. In addition, underwriting results were solid during the quarter. Offsetting this were higher expenses, including $9 million, net of income tax, due to non-recoverable overpayments on certain dental claims. Results were also negatively impacted by an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $9 million, net of income tax, resulting from the adoption of SOP 05-1 and a charge of $19 million, net of income tax, related to certain insurance liability adjustments.
Individual Business operating earnings were a record $449 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared with $353 million in the prior year period. The segment's strong earnings increase was driven by growth in the business, improved overall spreads due to higher net investment income, as well as favorable equity market performance.
Individual Business Earnings of $449 Million, up 27%
Total life earnings were up 16% compared with the prior year period, reflecting an increase in net investment income and improved underwriting results.
Annuity earnings grew 31% over the second quarter of 2006 to $270 million due to significant growth in the business and higher net investment income. Fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business increased 19% compared with the second quarter of 2006. Total annuity statutory premiums and deposits reached a new high of $4.5 billion in the second quarter of 2007, up 6% over the record prior year period. In addition, total annuity assets reached $132.7 billion.
Auto & Home operating earnings were $108 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared with $99 million in the prior year period. The increase in earnings was driven by higher revenues and lower operating expenses. In addition, the segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $23 million, net of income tax, compared to $21 million in the prior year period. Catastrophe losses also were lower than expected during the second quarter of 2007, but similar to the prior year period.
Auto & Home Earnings of $108 Million, up 9%
International operating earnings were $117 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared with $64 million in the prior year period. International's strong performance was primarily due to business growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Also during the quarter, International benefited from $13 million, net of income tax, from local tax benefits and the impact of an unusually strong equity market in Korea. In addition, expense management initiatives across the segment also positively impacted results.
International Earnings of $117 Million, up 83%
During the second quarter of 2007, International premiums, fees and other revenues grew 17% over the prior year period to reach a record $1 billion. In Japan, MSI MetLife achieved annuity sales of $1.3 billion, up slightly over the prior year period on a yen basis.
 
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter of 2007. Before income tax and the impact of deferred policy acquisition costs, variable investment income was approximately $220 million higher than planned, driven by record corporate joint venture income.
Investments
During the second quarter of 2007, MetLife took advantage of higher interest rates to improve its investment portfolio return. This activity contributed to net realized investment losses, after income tax, of $193 million. Included in this result were net derivative losses, after income tax, of $70 million related to positions that protect economic value but do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Corporate & Other had operating earnings of $78 million during the second quarter of 2007, reflecting strong net investment income and the benefit of a $20 million, net of income tax, reduction in legal liabilities and a $25 million, net of income tax, favorable legal settlement.
Corporate & Other
As of June 30, 2007, MetLife had approximately $441 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization. Future share purchases could be made during the second half of 2007 dependent upon market conditions and other corporate considerations.

MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
 
diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as net income and net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.
In this release, MetLife provides guidance on its future earnings per diluted common share on an operating, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
