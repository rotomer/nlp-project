Third Quarter Highlights
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $1,161 million, or $1.52 per diluted common share, compared with $958 million, or $1.24 per diluted common share, for the prior year period.
"During the third quarter of 2007, MetLife achieved strong growth over the prior year period in its bottom line, driven by solid underwriting and good investment results, despite a challenging market environment," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "During the quarter, we increased annuity deposits in the U.S., Japan and South Korea; achieved a new operating earnings record in International; and generated strong operating earnings growth in Institutional."
"We're extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first nine months of 2007, during which we grew our business and repurchased $975 million in common stock. These efforts, combined with the recently announced 25% increase in our common stock dividend, further demonstrate our ongoing commitment to build shareholder value," added Henrikson.
Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Third Quarter Segment Overview
Institutional Business operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $467 million, compared with $390 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, the segment grew its asset base, produced strong underwriting results, experienced solid interest spreads and incurred lower expenses.
Institutional Business Earnings of $467 Million, up 20%
Group life operating earnings during the third quarter of 2007 grew 20% to $121 million, compared with $101 million in the prior year period. The growth in operating earnings was driven by an 8% increase in premiums, fees and other revenues over the prior year period, continued good underwriting results and higher interest spreads. This was offset, in part, by an increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs of $3 million, net of income tax, resulting from the adoption of AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1.
Retirement & savings operating earnings were $240 million in the third quarter of 2007, up 19% from the $201 million earned in the prior year period. During the quarter, a 12% increase in the general account assets and lower expenses more than offset tighter interest spreads. Retirement & savings' total assets reached a record $127 billion.
Non-medical health & other operating earnings were a record $106 million during the third quarter of 2007, up 20% from $88 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating
 
earnings was mostly driven by excellent underwriting results. The operating earnings growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs of $6 million, net of income tax, resulting from the adoption of SOP 05-1. During the quarter, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 6% over the prior year period.
Individual Business operating earnings were $363 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared with $367 million in the prior year period.
Individual Business Earnings of $363 Million
Annuity operating earnings grew 22% from $192 million in the prior year period to $235 million in the third quarter of 2007. Fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2006. In addition, total annuity statutory premiums and deposits grew 22% over the prior year period to $4.4 billion while total annuity assets reached $135 billion.
Total life operating earnings declined to $117 million, compared with $167 million in the prior year period, due to higher expenses and lower underwriting margins. In addition, operating earnings in the prior year period benefited from a $12 million reserve reduction. During the third quarter of 2007, total life first year premiums and deposits grew 14% over the prior year period with sales up in both the independent and affiliated channels.
Auto & Home operating earnings were $109 million in the third quarter of 2007, up slightly from $107 million in the prior year period. The segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $18 million, net of income tax, compared to $27 million, net of income tax, in the prior year period. In addition, catastrophe losses were lower than expected during the third quarter of 2007.
Auto & Home Earnings Remain Strong at $109 Million
International operating earnings were a record $134 million in the third quarter of 2007, 86% higher than the $72 million earned in the prior year period. International's strong performance was primarily due to business growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. During the quarter, International also benefited from a $10 million, net of income tax, benefit from an adjustment to deferred acquisition costs and an $8 million, net of income tax, claim liability reduction in the Latin America region.
International Earnings Reach a Record $134 Million
International premiums, fees and other revenues grew 15% over the prior year period to exceed $1 billion. In Japan, MSI MetLife achieved annuity deposits of 196 billion yen ($1.7 billion), a 10% increase over the prior year period on a local currency basis. In addition, total assets in Japan reached $24.2 billion. In South Korea on a local currency basis, annuity deposits more than tripled to 150 billion won ($162 million) compared to the prior year period.
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter of 2007. Before income tax and the impact on deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was approximately $145 million higher than plan, driven primarily by higher corporate joint venture income. During the third quarter of 2007, the unusual volatility in the equity and fixed income markets resulted in hedge fund losses of $25 million, net of income tax.
Investments
 
During the third quarter of 2007, MetLife took advantage of higher interest rates to improve its investment portfolio return. This activity contributed to net realized investment losses, after income tax, of $215 million. Included in this result were net derivative losses, after income tax, of $60 million related to positions that protect economic value but do not qualify for hedge accounting.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, MetLife repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $200 million. At September 30, 2007, MetLife had $1.2 billion remaining on its existing share repurchase authorizations. In the fourth quarter of 2007, MetLife plans to repurchase approximately $750 million of its common stock pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement.

MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and
