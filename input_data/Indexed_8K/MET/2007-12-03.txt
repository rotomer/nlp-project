NEW YORK, December 3, 2007  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today announced its expected results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 and provided several financial targets for 2008. Members of MetLife's senior management team will discuss the company's businesses at MetLife's annual investor conference beginning at 8 a.m. today.
Strong Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2007 Results
For the fourth quarter of 2007, MetLife expects to generate between $1.40 and $1.45 in operating earnings per diluted common share, compared with $1.36 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result, MetLife projects full year 2007 operating earnings to be between $6.04 and $6.09 per diluted common share compared with $5.21 per diluted common share in 2006.
"2007 is going to be another strong earnings year for MetLife," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Our core businesses are performing extremely well. Total 2007 operating earnings per diluted common share are expected to grow approximately 16% over 2006's results due to our robust business performance and unusually strong investment results. Our market leadership, combined with our commitment to expand our growth in the U.S. and internationally, has enabled us to deliver strong, consistent growth in a variety of market conditions and environments."
Full Year 2008 Goals
During 2008, MetLife expects to generate between $5.90 and $6.20 per share in operating earnings for the year, reflecting strong earnings growth from operations. MetLife also expects to
 
achieve an operating return on equity of 13.0% to 13.6% and repurchase $2.2 billion in common stock in 2008.
MetLife also announced today a goal of achieving an operating return on equity of 15% by year-end 2010.
"With our businesses poised to expand upon their strong performance in 2007, we are excited about 2008," added Henrikson. "On a global basis, we see a number of opportunities where MetLife is well positioned to expand its growth. Our asset-liability management and underwriting expertise  combined with MetLife's strong brand name, competitive products and wide distribution network  will enable us to keep winning in the marketplace every day. We are committed to growing our book value and return on equity to deliver shareholder value."
MetLife will hold its annual investor conference today from 8:00 a.m. to approximately 12:30 p.m. (ET). A live audio and video Webcast of the conference, along with the presentation materials, will be available at www.metlife.com (through a link on the Investor Relations page). A replay of the conference will be available at MetLife's Web site beginning shortly after the conference ends on December 3, until 11:59 p.m. (ET) on December 10, 2007.
In this release, MetLife provides guidance on its future earnings and earnings per diluted common share on an operating, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income and net income per diluted common share.
Assumptions included in MetLife's estimated fourth quarter and full year 2007 and projected full year 2008 results are discussed in detail in the slide presentations to be presented at MetLife's annual investor conference, which are included in a Current Report on Form 8-K that was furnished earlier today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued
 
real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
