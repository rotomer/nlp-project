Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
          On December 11, 2007, the MetLife, Inc. board of directors (the "Board") adopted the MetLife Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), effective December 17, 2007. All individuals employed by MetLife, Inc. (the "Company") or its affiliates who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other individuals granted eligibility by the Compensation Committee of the Board and named in an appendix to the Severance Plan (collectively, the "Participants") are eligible for benefits under the Severance Plan. To the extent a Participant had an Employment Continuation Agreement with the Company (each, a "Continuation Agreement"), the Severance Plan replaces that agreement. Pursuant to the terms of a Termination of Employment Continuation Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference, each of Messrs. Henrikson, Wheeler and Toppeta, and Mmes. Weber and Rein, agreed to terminate his or her Continuation Agreement, effective December 17, 2007, in consideration of the adoption of the Severance Plan.
          The Severance Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference, is intended to provide benefits to Participants should their employment end, under certain circumstances, during the three years after a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Severance Plan). The terms of the Severance Plan are substantially similar to those of the Continuation Agreements, except that:
          Also on December 11, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved (i) an Amendment to Management Performance Share Agreements pursuant to the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2005 Plan"), effective as of December 31, 2007 (the "Amendment"), (ii) a new form of Management Performance Share Agreement pursuant to the 2005 Plan, effective as of December 11, 2007, and (iii) a new form of Management Restricted Stock Unit Agreement pursuant to the 2005 Plan, effective as of December 11, 2007. The terms of the new form of Management Performance Share Agreement and new form of Management Restricted Stock Unit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in the form of Management Performance Share Agreement and form of Management Restricted Stock Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.27 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and Exhibit 10.4 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 10, 2006, respectively, except that:
          The effect of the Amendment is to incorporate similar changes into the outstanding Management Performance Share Agreements and Management Restricted Stock Unit Agreements. The Amendment, the new form of Management Performance Share Agreement and the new form of Management Restricted Stock Unit Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

     (i) . In the event that any of the Covered Payments to an Executive would be an Excess Parachute Payment as defined in Section 280G of the Code, and would thereby subject the Executive to the Excise Tax, and the net after-tax benefit that the Executive would receive by applying the Payment Cap is greater than the net after-tax benefit the Executive would receive if the Payment Cap were not applied to Executive's Covered Payments, then the Severance Pay payable to the Executive shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the Severance Pay and all other Covered Payments do not exceed the amount of the Payment Cap.
Application of Section 3(c) Hereof
     (ii) . Promptly after delivery of any Notice of Termination, the Company shall notify the Executive of the aggregate present value of all Covered Payments to which the Executive would be entitled under the Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement as of the projected Date of Termination, together with the projected maximum payments, determined as of such projected Date of Termination that could be paid without the Executive being subject to the Excise Tax.
Calculation of Benefits
     (iii) . For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax:
Application of Section 280G of the Code
     (a) such Covered Payments will be treated as Parachute Payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all Parachute Payments in excess of the Base Amount shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Accountants, the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to the Executive pursuant to the Plan, or any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to the Executive by the Company or any Affiliate under any other plan, agreement, or arrangement (in whole or in part), either do not constitute Parachute Payments or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the portion of the Base Amount allocable to such Covered Payments, or such Parachute Payments are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
     (b) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
     (iv) . For purposes of determining whether the net after-tax benefit that the Executive would receive by applying the Payment Cap is greater than the net after-tax benefit the Executive would receive if the Payment Cap were not applied to Executive's
Assumptions in Determining Net After-Tax Benefit
 
Covered Payments, Executive shall be deemed to pay (a) Federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the first amounts are to be paid hereunder, and (b) any applicable state and local income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for such calendar year, net of the maximum reduction in Federal incomes taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year.
     4. . Except as expressly provided herein, nothing in the Plan shall prevent or limit an Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the Company or any Affiliate and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise prejudice such rights as the Executive may have under any other agreements with the Company or any Affiliate, including employment agreements or stock option agreements.
Non-exclusivity of Rights

No Offset
     6. . If, on or after the date of a Change of Control, an Executive asserts any claim in any contest (whether initiated by the Executive or by the Company) as to the validity, enforceability or interpretation of any provision of the Plan, or any claim for any Earned Obligations (including but not limited to the timely payment of Earned Obligations under law or accordance with the terms of the applicable plan, program or arrangement), the Company shall pay the Executive's legal expenses (or cause such expenses to be paid) including, but not limited to, the Executive's reasonable attorney's fees, on a quarterly basis, upon presentation of proof of such expenses in a form acceptable to the Company, the Executive shall reimburse the Company for such amounts, plus simple interest thereon at the 90-day United States Treasury Bill rate as in effect from time to time, compounded annually, if the Executive shall not prevail, in whole or in part, as to at least one material issue as to the validity, enforceability or interpretation of any provision of the Plan or the Executive's right to any Earned Obligations.

the Plan in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would have been required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
     8. . The Plan is an unfunded employee benefit plan established by the Company. Any obligation to pay benefits under this Plan are general, unsecured obligations of the Company that shall be paid out of the general assets of the Company, or an Affiliate on behalf of the Company.
Unsecured Nature of Obligations

     Pursuant to the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), MetLife, Inc. hereby amends each of your Management Performance Share Agreements (the "Agreements") as of December 31, 2007, as follows (this "Amendment"):
     1. Section 2(f) of each Agreement is restated in its entirety as follows:
     (f) . Unless the Committee determines otherwise, if no other provision in this Section 2 regarding change of status applies, including, for example, your voluntary termination of employment, your termination without Retirement or Bridge Eligibility, or your termination by the Company or an Affiliate without Cause, your Performance Shares will be forfeited immediately unless you are offered a separation agreement by the Company or an Affiliate under a severance program. To the extent you are offered a separation agreement by the Company or an Affiliate, and your separation agreement becomes final, your Prorated Performance Shares will be due and payable to you. The number of your "Prorated Performance Shares" will be determined by dividing the number of calendar months in the Performance Period that have ended as of the end of the month of the termination of your employment by thirty-six (36), multiplying the result by the number of your Performance Shares, and rounding to the nearest whole number; , that if the date of the termination of your employment is prior to the first anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period, then the number of your Prorated Performance Shares shall be zero (0). Payment for each of your Prorated Performance Shares will be made in cash at a value equal to the Closing Price on the Grant Date, and shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred dollars ($100.00). If your separation agreement does not become final, your Performance Shares will be forfeited.
Other Termination of Employment
provided, however
     2. Section 3 of each Agreement is restated in its entirety as follows:
3.
Change of Control
.
     (a) Except as provided in Section 3(b), and unless otherwise prohibited under law or by applicable rules of a national security exchange, if a Change of Control occurs, your Performance Shares will be due and payable in the form of cash equal to the number of your Performance Shares multiplied by the Change of Control Price.
     (b) The terms of Section 3(a) will not apply to your Performance Shares if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith, prior to the Change of Control, that you have been granted an Alternative Award for your Performance Shares pursuant to Section 15.2 of the Plan. Any such Alternative Award shall not accelerate the timing of payment or otherwise violate Code Section 409A.
3. Section 8 of each Agreement is restated in its entirety as follows:
8.
Timing of Payment
.
     (a) This Agreement is intended to comply with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted accordingly. If Shares are to be paid to you, you will receive evidence of ownership of those Shares.
     (b) If payment is due and payable under Section 2(b), it will be made upon your death.
 
     (c) If payment is due and payable under Section 2(f), it will be made six (6) months after the termination of your employment (or six (6) months after your "separation from service" under Code Section 409A, if that is a different date).
     (d) If payment is due and payable under Section 3(a), and the Change of Control that causes payment to be due and payable is a "change of control" as defined under Code Section 409A, such sum shall be paid to you within thirty (30) days of the Change of Control. If payment is due and payable under Section 3(a), and the Change of Control that causes payment to be due and payable is not a "change of control" as defined under Code Section 409A, such sum shall be paid to you at the time determined under Section 8(e).
     (e) If payment is due and payable under the Standard Performance Terms and you have chosen to defer payment under an applicable deferred compensation plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate, payment will be made at the time determined under that plan. If payment is due and payable under the Standard Performance Terms and you have not chosen to defer payment under an applicable deferred compensation plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate, payment will be made in the calendar year after the end of the performance period.
     4. Any capitalized word used in this Amendment is defined in the Plan or each Agreement. This Amendment will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the law that might be applied under principles of conflict of laws. This Amendment, the Agreements, and the Plan represent the entire agreements between you and the Company, and you and all Affiliates, regarding your Performance Shares and no other promises, terms, or agreements of any kind regarding your Performance Shares apply. In the event any provision of this Amendment is held illegal or invalid, the rest of the Amendment will remain enforceable.

Standard Performance Terms
.
     (a) The terms of this Section 1 shall be referred to as the "Standard Performance Terms" and will apply to your Performance Shares except in so far as Sections 2 (Change of Status) or 3 (Change of Control) apply.
     (b) The Performance Period for your Performance Shares will begin on , and end on the December 31 immediately preceding the third anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period. After the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing the number of Performance Shares payable in accordance with Section 1(c) (your "Final Performance Shares"), and your Final Performance Shares will be due and payable in Shares.
[date]
[year]
     (c) The Committee will determine your Final Performance Shares by multiplying your Performance Shares by the "Performance Factor." The Performance Factor means a percentage (from zero to 200%) which is the sum of two other percentages (each from zero to 100%), described in (1) and (2) below.
     (1) The first percentage will be based on the Company's performance with respect to Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share during the Performance Period relative to the other companies in the Standard and Poor's Insurance Index, determined according to Table 1 of Schedule A to this Agreement. For this purpose, (a) "Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share" for any period means net income, excluding: (1) after-tax net investment gains and losses, (2) after-tax adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, (3) after-tax discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, and (4) preferred stock dividends, in each case determined according to generally accepted accounting principles, divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period determined on a diluted basis under generally accepted accounting principles; and (b) "Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share" means Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share in the final calendar year of the Performance Period divided by Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share in the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the Performance Period.
     (2) The second percentage will be based on the Company's performance with respect to Proportionate Total Shareholder Return during the Performance Period relative to the other companies in the Standard and Poor's Insurance Index, determined according to Table 2 of Schedule A to this Agreement. For this purpose, (a) "Initial Closing Price" means the average Closing Price (and, in the case of a company other than the Company, the most closely analogous price) in the twenty (20) trading days prior to the first day of the Performance Period; (b) "Final Closing Price" means the average Closing Price (and, the case of a company other than the Company, the most closely analogous price) in the twenty (20) trading days prior
 
to and including the final day of the Performance Period; (c) "Total Shareholder Return" means the change (plus or minus) from the Initial Closing Price to the Final Closing Price, plus dividends (if any) actually paid on Shares (or, in the case of a company other than the Company, the most closely analogous security) on a reinvested basis from the first day of the Performance Period to and including the last day of the Performance Period; and (d) "Proportionate Total Shareholder Return" means Total Shareholder Return divided by Initial Closing Price.
     (d) For these purposes, the Standard & Poor's Insurance Index means each company which is described by either of the following criteria:
     (1) the company is included in such index for the entirety of the Performance Period; or
     (2) the company is included in such index on the final day of the Performance Period, and at least fifty percent (50%) of the securities entitled to vote for the directors of that company were owned, directly or indirectly, immediately after and as the result of a merger, acquisition, or other similar corporate transaction, by a majority of the shareholders (determined immediately prior to such transaction) of a company that was either: (i) included in such index on the first day of the Performance Period, or (ii) described by this Section 1(d)(2).
     For purposes of this Section 2, your transfer between the Company and an Affiliate, or among Affiliates, will not be a termination of employment. In the event of a Change of Control, any applicable terms of Section 3 (Change of Control) will supersede the terms of this Section 2.
2. 
Change of Status
.
     (a) . In the event you qualify for long-term disability benefits under a plan or arrangement offered by the Company or an Affiliate for its Employees, the Standard Performance Terms will continue to apply to your Performance Shares. Once this provision applies, no other change of status described in this Section 2 (except the provision regarding termination for Cause) will affect your Performance Shares, even if you subsequently return to active service or your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates other than for Cause.
Long-Term Disability
     (b) . In the event that your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates due to your death, your Performance Shares will be due and payable in Shares (or cash at a value equal to the Closing Price on the date of your death, if so determined by the Committee).
Death
     (c) . If your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates (other than for Cause) on after your early retirement date or normal retirement date (in each case determined under any ERISA qualified pension plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate in which you participate) ("Retirement"), the Standard Performance Terms will continue to apply to your Performance Shares.
Retirement
     (d) . If your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates (other than for Cause) with bridge eligibility for retirement-related medical benefits (determined under an ERISA qualified benefit plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate in which you participate, if any) ("Bridge Eligibility"), and your separation agreement (offered to you under the severance program offered by the Company or an Affiliate to its Employees) becomes final, the Standard Performance Terms will continue to apply to your Performance Shares.
Bridge Eligibility
 
     (e) . In the event that your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates for Cause, your Performance Shares will be forfeited immediately.
Termination for Cause
     (f) . Unless the Committee determines otherwise, if no other provision in this Section 2 regarding change of status applies, including, for example, your voluntary termination of employment, your termination without Retirement or Bridge Eligibility, or your termination by the Company or an Affiliate without Cause, your Performance Shares will be forfeited immediately unless you are offered a separation agreement by the Company or an Affiliate under a severance program. To the extent your separation agreement becomes final, your Prorated Performance Shares will be due and payable to you. The number of your "Prorated Performance Shares" will be determined by dividing the number of calendar months in the Performance Period that have ended as of the end of the month of the termination of your employment by thirty-six (36), multiplying the result by the number of your Performance Shares, and rounding to the nearest whole number; , that if the date of the termination of your employment is prior to the first anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period, then the number of your Prorated Performance Shares shall be zero (0). Payment for each of your Prorated Performance Shares will be made in cash at a value equal to the Closing Price on the Grant Date, and shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred dollars ($100.00). If your separation agreement does not become final, your Performance Shares will be forfeited.

     (b) The terms of Section 3(a) will not apply to your Performance Shares if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith, prior to the Change of Control, that you have been granted an Alternative Award for your Performance Shares pursuant to Section 15.2 of the Plan. Any such Alternative Award shall not accelerate the timing of payment or otherwise violate Code Section 409A.
     Except as provided in Section 5 or as otherwise permitted by the Committee, you may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate any of your Performance Shares, and all rights with respect to your Performance Shares are exercisable during your lifetime only by you.

Each beneficiary designation for such purpose will revoke all such prior designations. Beneficiary designations must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Committee and must be filed with the Company during your lifetime. If you have not designated a beneficiary, your rights under this Agreement will pass to and may be exercised by your estate.

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Committee" includes any direct or indirect delegate of the Committee as defined in the Plan, and the word "Section" refers to a Section in this Agreement. Any other capitalized word used in this Agreement and not defined in this Agreement, including each form of that word, is defined in the Plan. Any determination or interpretation by the Committee pursuant to this Agreement will be final and conclusive. In the event of a conflict between any term of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan control. This Agreement and the Plan represent the entire agreement between you and the Company, and you and all Affiliates regarding your Units. No promises, terms, or agreements of any kind regarding your Units that are not set forth, or referred to, in this Agreement or in the Plan are part of this Agreement. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the rest of this Agreement will remain enforceable. If you are an Employee of an Affiliate, your Units are being provided to you by the Company on behalf of that Affiliate, and the value of your Units will be considered a compensation obligation of that Affiliate. Your Units are not Shares and do not give you the rights of a holder of Shares. You will not be credited with additional Units on account of any dividend paid on Shares. The issuance of Shares or payment of cash pursuant to your Units is subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to any approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. No Shares will be issued or no cash will be paid if that issuance or payment would result in a violation of applicable law, including the federal securities laws and any applicable state or foreign securities laws.
