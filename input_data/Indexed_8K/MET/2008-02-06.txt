Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, February 6, 2008  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported fourth quarter 2007 net income of $1,083 million, or $1.44 per diluted common share. In the fourth quarter of 2006, MetLife's net income benefited from a one time net investment gain of $3 billion, net of income tax, due to the sale of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town. This gain contributed to a record quarterly net income of $3,829 million, or $4.95 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2006. Without this gain, MetLife's fourth quarter 2006 net income would have been $829 million, or $1.07 per diluted common share.

MetLife today also reported full year 2007 net income of $4,180 million, or $5.48 per diluted common share, compared with $6,159 million, or $7.99 per diluted common share, for 2006. Full year 2006 net income also reflects the above mentioned gain from a real estate sale. Without this gain, MetLife's 2006 full year net income would have been $3,159 million, or $4.09 per diluted common share.
 
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $1,208 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share, compared with $1,054 million, or $1.36 per diluted common share, for the prior period.
"MetLife had an outstanding quarter with record premiums, fees and other revenues of $9.1 billion," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "In addition, our Institutional and International businesses delivered record operating earnings, and Individual Business generated strong year-over-year growth in both annuity deposits and total life premiums."
 
Full Year Highlights
Operating earnings for 2007 were $4,762 million, or $6.25 per diluted common share, compared with $4,022 million, or $5.22 per diluted common share, for 2006.
"I'm very pleased with our record revenue and earnings performance in 2007. We continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business and have produced excellent results. In 2007, we grew book value per share and generated an operating return on equity of 15.2% as we continue our commitment to building shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for 2008," added Henrikson.
Fourth Quarter Segment Overview
Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Institutional Business Earnings a Record $527 Million, up 20%
Operating earnings in Institutional Business increased 20% to $527 million compared with $441 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 as the segment experienced strong growth in premiums, fees and other revenues in the group life and non-medical health and other businesses due to favorable sales and persistency. Earnings also benefited from very strong investment results across the businesses.
Retirement & savings operating earnings were a record $336 million in the quarter, up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2006. The strong performance during the quarter reflects wider interest spreads due to strong investment income and lower crediting rates, as well as good underwriting results and lower expenses.
Operating earnings in non-medical health & other were $98 million in the quarter, up 32% from the fourth quarter of 2006. The growth in earnings was due primarily to improved underwriting results as well as a 12% increase in premiums, fees and other revenues, including a 15% increase in both dental and disability premiums, fees and other revenues.
Group life operating earnings for the quarter were $93 million, compared with $95 million in the prior period. Earnings in the business benefited from a 6% growth in premiums, fees and other revenues as well as higher interest spreads. Earnings for the quarter were impacted by certain non-recurring expenses.
Individual Business Earnings of $382 Million
The Individual Business segment had operating earnings of $382 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with $415 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. While earnings
 
declined year-over-year, the segment experienced top-line growth and increases in both variable annuity deposits and total first year life premiums.
Total life operating earnings were $181 million, compared with $183 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net revisions to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs favorably impacted fourth quarter 2007 earnings by $48 million, net of income tax. This was partially offset by mortality liability adjustments. Total life first year premiums and deposits grew 27% over the prior period. In addition, sales increased for the third consecutive quarter in all major channels driven by recent systems and service enhancements as well as a focus on key account relationships.
Annuity operating earnings were $186 million, compared with $230 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. While investment results were strong during the quarter, they were more than offset by net revisions to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs that reduced fourth quarter 2007 earnings by $41 million, net of income tax. Fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business rose 22% and total annuity premiums and deposits grew from $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $4.0 billion. Variable annuity statutory premiums and deposits rose 13% due to product enhancements, strong account relationships and growth in the agency distribution channels.
Auto & Home Earnings of $103 Million
Auto & Home operating earnings were $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $115 million in the prior period. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $25 million, net of income tax, compared with $52 million, net of income tax, in the prior period. In addition, catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 were within expectations and lower than the prior period.
International Business Earnings of $193 Million
International operating earnings were $193 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter 2006 earnings, which were negatively impacted by certain one time items, were $16 million.
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 reflect sound business results in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. In addition, Latin America earnings were positively impacted by a one time liability reduction and related tax benefits, due to pension regulation changes, in the amount of $105 million.
International continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2007 as premiums, fees and other revenues grew 14% over the prior period to exceed $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. In South Korea, on a local currency basis, sales more than doubled compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 reaching 430 billion won ($467 million). This was due to growth in the agency distribution channel as well as institutional pension sales and new retail product launches. In line with current market conditions and due in part to new regulatory guidelines, Japan annuity deposits of 139 billion yen ($1.2 billion) were down from 183 billion yen ($1.6 billion) in the prior period.
 
Investments
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter of 2007. Before income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was approximately $270 million higher than plan, driven by higher corporate joint venture and securities lending income.
In the quarter, MetLife had net realized investment losses, after income tax, of $182 million, including $49 million, net of income tax, in credit-related losses. The remainder of the net realized investment losses was primarily driven by net derivative losses related to positions that protect economic value but do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Corporate Events
Share Repurchase
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, MetLife repurchased approximately 11.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $731 million, under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. To date in 2008, MetLife has repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $450 million pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement signed in December 2007.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is defined as operating earnings available
 
to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
 
 
 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as net income and net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
