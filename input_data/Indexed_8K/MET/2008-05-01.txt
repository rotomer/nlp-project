First Quarter Highlights
"MetLife had a strong first quarter," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Compared to the prior year period, we grew top line results by 12%, increased operating earnings per share by 8% and continued to demonstrate the benefit of having a diverse mix of businesses. Despite the challenges posed by the credit and equity markets, we continued to execute well on our plans. Institutional Business generated record operating earnings fueled by strong top-line growth while Individual Business increased life insurance sales and International's top line grew by 25% over the first quarter of 2007. At the same time, we also repurchased more than 20 million shares of MetLife common stock."
First Quarter Segment Overview
Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Institutional Business Earnings a Record $558 Million, up 23%
Institutional Business had a record quarter, generating $558 million in operating earnings, compared with $452 million in the first quarter of 2007. In addition to growing total premiums, fees and other revenues by 14% over the first quarter of 2007, Institutional had solid underwriting results, particularly in retirement & savings and non-medical health, as well as wider interest spreads.
Retirement & savings operating earnings were $321 million in the quarter, up 21% from the first quarter of 2007. The strong performance during the quarter reflects favorable underwriting results as well as wider interest spreads. In addition, premiums, fees and other revenues rose 59% due in part to higher pension closeout sales during the quarter.
Operating earnings in non-medical health & other were a record $118 million in the quarter, up 49% from the first quarter of 2007. The earnings growth was driven by improved underwriting results and lower expenses. Also in the quarter, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 13% and reflect a 24% increase in dental's top line results, which benefited in part from the recent acquisition of a dental HMO.
Group life operating earnings for the quarter were $119 million, up 11% from the first quarter of 2007. Earnings in the business benefited from a 5% growth in premiums, fees and other revenues as well as wider interest spreads.
Individual Business Earnings of $312 Million
Individual Business had operating earnings of $312 million during the first quarter of 2008 compared with $319 million in the first quarter of 2007. The equity market downturn contributed to the relatively flat earnings in the segment year-over-year. Individual Business generated strong top-line growth in life insurance sales, although volatile equity markets resulted in lower variable annuity deposits during the quarter.
 
Total life operating earnings for the quarter were $131 million, up 14% from the first quarter of 2007. During the quarter, strong investment earnings were partially offset by lower underwriting margins. Total life first year premiums and deposits grew 9% over the first quarter of 2007, driven by continued success in the independent channel.
Annuity operating earnings were $167 million, compared with $210 million in the first quarter of 2007. An unfavorable equity market impacted annuity earnings during the quarter. Fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business rose 5% while variable annuity premiums and deposits were $3.2 billion, slightly lower than the $3.3 billion received in the first quarter of 2007.
Auto & Home Earnings of $98 Million
Auto & Home operating earnings were $98 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared with $106 million in the first quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, the segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $23 million, net of income tax, compared with $30 million, net of income tax, in the prior year period. In addition, catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2008 were $16 million, net of income tax. This result was $9 million more than the first quarter of 2007 and higher than expected.
International Business Earnings of $137 Million, up 10%
International Business generated operating earnings of $137 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared with $124 million in the prior year period. Results in the segment were driven in large part by strong performance in the Latin America region.
For the quarter, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 19% on a comparable currency basis over the prior year period to reach $1.2 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter that results have exceeded $1 billion. In South Korea, on a local currency basis, sales grew by 82% compared to the first quarter of 2007 to reach 267 billion won ($289 million). In line with current market conditions and due in part to recent changes in regulatory guidelines, Japan annuity deposits of 157 billion yen ($1.45 billion) were down from 190 billion yen ($1.63 billion) in the prior year period.
Investments
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2008. Before income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was approximately $20 million higher than plan.
In the quarter, MetLife had net realized investment losses, after income tax, of $560 million, including $150 million, net of income tax, in credit-related losses. This level of credit-related losses is in line with the company's expectations given the current credit market environment and had little impact on MetLife's $350 billion general account portfolio. The remainder of the net realized investment losses was primarily driven by net derivative losses related to investment positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivative losses were driven by a significant drop in the value of the U.S. dollar and a drop in interest rates, particularly at the short end of the curve. These losses are generally offset by corresponding adjustments elsewhere in the company's financial statements.
 
Corporate Events
Share Repurchase
For the quarter ended March 31, 2008, MetLife repurchased approximately 20.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,250 million. Currently, MetLife has $1,261 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorizations.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
 
 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as net income and net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income, operating earnings available to common shareholders to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share to GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release dated May 1, 2008, for the three months ended March 31, 2008, which are available at www.metlife.com.
