Second Quarter Highlights
"During the second quarter of 2008, MetLife achieved a new record in top-line results, with premiums, fees and other revenues reaching $9.5 billion," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "While our earnings this quarter were impacted by several factors, including the continuing decline in the equity markets and higher catastrophes in our homeowners business, our business fundamentals continue to be strong. We generated solid earnings growth in International, achieved significant top-line growth in Institutional Business and continued to execute on our business plans during the quarter."
Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Second Quarter Segment Overview
Institutional Business had operating earnings of $448 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with $521 million in the second quarter of 2007. Total premiums, fees and other revenues grew 16% over the second quarter of 2007, as Institutional Business achieved strong top-line growth in all of its businesses. Earnings results were impacted by lower investment income, less favorable group life underwriting results and a liability adjustment on a large institutional annuity contract.
Institutional Business Earnings of $448 Million
Group life operating earnings for the quarter were $136 million compared with $142 million in the second quarter of 2007. Strong interest margins in the second quarter of 2008 were offset by higher incurred claims. In addition, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 8% over the second quarter of 2007.
Non-medical health & other operating earnings were $93 million in the quarter, up 16% from the $80 million earned in the second quarter of 2007. Premiums, fees and other revenues for this business increased 14%, due to solid growth in several product lines, particularly in dental, which continued to benefit from a recent dental HMO acquisition.
Retirement & savings operating earnings were $219 million in the quarter compared with $299 million in the second quarter of 2007 due in part to lower investment income and the above-mentioned liability adjustment. Retirement & savings premiums, fees and other revenues rose 65% due mostly to higher pension closeout sales during the quarter.
Individual Business had operating earnings of $323 million during the second quarter of 2008 compared with $449 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Individual Business Earnings of $323 Million
 
Total life operating earnings for the quarter were $161 million, relatively flat compared with the $163 million earned in the second quarter of 2007. During the quarter, higher investment income in the traditional life business was more than offset by lower underwriting margins and lower interest spreads in the variable/universal life business. Total life first year premiums and deposits increased slightly over the second quarter of 2007.
Annuity operating earnings were $146 million, compared with $270 million in the second quarter of 2007. A deferred acquisition cost adjustment related to the unfavorable equity market, as well as lower investment income, contributed to the decline in earnings. Compared with the second quarter of 2007, fees for separate account investment-type products within the annuity business increased slightly. In addition, variable annuity premiums and deposits were $3.5 billion, up from the $3.2 billion received in the first quarter of 2008, but down compared with the record $4.2 billion received in the second quarter of 2007.
Auto & Home operating earnings were $52 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with $108 million in the second quarter of 2007. A 23% increase in auto earnings over the second quarter of 2007 was more than offset by an unusually high level of catastrophes in the homeowners business. In the second quarter of 2008, the segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $26 million, net of income tax, compared with $23 million, net of income tax, in the prior year period.
Auto & Home Earnings of $52 Million
International Business operating earnings increased 26% to $147 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with $117 million in the prior year period. Earnings results in the segment were driven by strong performance in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. For the quarter, total premiums, fees and other revenues grew 15% on a comparable currency basis over the prior year period to reach $1.2 billion. Annuity deposits in Japan of 150 billion yen ($1.4 billion) were relatively equal compared with 152 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in the prior year period, reflecting current market conditions.
International Business Earnings of $147 Million
MetLife's investment portfolio continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter of 2008. Net realized investment losses, after income tax, were $233 million. Included in these losses were approximately $175 million, net of income tax, in credit-related losses, which were modest relative to the size of MetLife's $350 billion general account portfolio. Before income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was approximately $30 million lower than plan.
Investments
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $81 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with $78 million of operating earnings in the second quarter of 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, Corporate & Other benefited from $45 million, net of income tax, due to legal liability reductions. In addition, Corporate & Other had lower investment income in the second quarter of 2008.
Corporate & Other
 
"As a result of a strategic review that we began in 2007, we have launched an enterprise initiative called Operational Excellence. This initiative began in April of this year, and is focused on reducing complexity, increasing productivity and improving the effectiveness of our operations," said Henrikson. "Operational Excellence is expected to achieve both revenue enhancements and cost savings. We will provide more details on how Operational Excellence will serve as a foundation for our future growth, and any required investments, when we announce third quarter results in October and at our Investor Day meeting in December."
Operational Excellence Initiative
"Given the performance of the equity markets and our results this quarter, we are revising our previously announced full year 2008 operating earnings guidance of $5.90 to $6.20 per diluted common share to $5.70 to $5.90 per diluted common share. This projection does not include the impact of any unusual events, such as Operational Excellence," added Henrikson. "We are pleased with the strong revenue growth we achieved in the first half of 2008, and we continue to see many growth opportunities ahead, where our financial strength, industry leadership and diverse offerings will serve us well."
Earnings Guidance
During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, MetLife received approximately 0.9 million shares related to an accelerated share repurchase transaction executed in February 2008. As a result, for the six months ended June 30, 2008, MetLife repurchased approximately 21.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1,250 million. Currently, MetLife has $1,261 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorizations.

MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
 
which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
 
 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as net income and net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.
In this release, MetLife provides guidance on its future earnings per diluted common share on an operating, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income, GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income, operating earnings available to common shareholders to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share to GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release dated July 29, 2008, for the three months ended June 30, 2008, which are available at www.metlife.com.
