Date: September 12, 2008
 

NEW YORK, September 11, 2008  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced today the final exchange ratio in connection with its previously announced offer to its stockholders to exchange all or some of their shares of MetLife common stock for 29,243,539 shares of class B common stock of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA.B). The exchange offer is being made in connection with the companies' June 2, 2008 announcement of MetLife's intent to split-off substantially all of its 52% interest in RGA.
For each share of MetLife common stock that is validly tendered and delivered pursuant to the exchange offer and accepted by MetLife, MetLife will deliver 1.2663 shares of RGA class B common stock to or at the direction of each tendering holder. The final calculated per-share value of MetLife common stock and RGA common stock used to calculate the exchange ratio for the exchange offer were $57.06063 and $50.06803, respectively.
The exchange offer will expire at the end of today, September 11, 2008, at 12:00 midnight (ET). Because the exchange offer is subject to proration if the offer is oversubscribed, the number of shares that MetLife accepts in the exchange offer may be less than the number of shares tendered.
The terms and conditions of the exchange offer are more fully described in an exchange offer prospectus previously filed by RGA and a Schedule TO, as amended, previously filed by MetLife with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife stockholders who tender their shares by means of a notice of guaranteed delivery before expiration of the exchange offer must deliver the related shares to the exchange agent, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, by Tuesday, September 16, 2008.

Filed by: MetLife, Inc. Pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act of 1933 and deemed filed under other applicable sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Subject Company: MetLife, Inc. Commission File No.: 333-152828
On September 12, 2008, MetLife, Inc. issued the following press release announcing the preliminary results of the exchange offer for the split-off of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated.
NEW YORK, September 12, 2008  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced today that, based on preliminary results, the previously announced offer to its stockholders to exchange all or some of their shares of MetLife common stock for 29,243,539 shares of class B common stock of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA.B) was oversubscribed. The exchange offer was made in connection with the companies' June 2, 2008 announcement of MetLife's intent to split-off substantially all of its 52% interest in RGA. The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight (ET) at the end of the day on Thursday, September 11, 2008.
Based on a preliminary count by the exchange agent, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, 253,284,912 shares of MetLife common stock were tendered for exchange, including 138,949,602 shares that were tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery. Because the exchange offer was oversubscribed, MetLife will accept only a portion of the total number of shares of MetLife common stock that were validly tendered and delivered by MetLife stockholders, on a pro rata basis in proportion to the total number of shares tendered by such stockholder. MetLife will accept for exchange 23,093,689 shares of MetLife common stock in exchange for the 29,243,539 shares of class B common stock of RGA. In accordance with the terms of the exchange offer, MetLife stockholders who owned less than 100 shares of MetLife common stock, or an "odd-lot," who have validly tendered and delivered all of their MetLife shares will not be subject to proration if they elected for such treatment in the exchange offer.
Based on the preliminary results, if all shares tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery are delivered under the terms of the exchange offer, it is estimated that approximately 8.6% of the tendered MetLife common stock will be accepted for exchange. This estimated preliminary proration factor is subject to change. MetLife expects to announce the final results of the exchange offer, including the final proration factor, on or before Wednesday, September 17, 2008.
Shares of RGA class B common stock (issued in book entry form) and shares of MetLife common stock tendered but not accepted for exchange will be credited to accounts of tendering stockholders promptly after the final results of the exchange offer are announced. In addition,
 
checks in lieu of fractional shares of RGA class B common stock will be delivered or mailed promptly after the final results of the exchange offer are announced.
The terms and conditions of the exchange offer are more fully described in an exchange offer prospectus previously filed by RGA and a Schedule TO, as amended, previously filed by MetLife with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife stockholders who tendered their shares by means of a notice of guaranteed delivery before expiration of the exchange offer must deliver the related shares to the exchange agent by Tuesday, September 16, 2008.
In connection with the exchange offer (which expired at 12:00 midnight (ET) at the end of September 11, 2008), RGA filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-152828), as amended, that included an exchange offer prospectus dated August 11, 2008, and MetLife filed with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO, as amended, that included such exchange offer prospectus and related transmittal materials.
