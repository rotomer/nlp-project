Exhibit 99.1
Filed by: MetLife, Inc. Pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act of 1933 and deemed filed under other applicable sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Subject Company: MetLife, Inc. Commission File No.: 333-152828
On September 17, 2008, MetLife, Inc. issued the following press release announcing the final results of the exchange offer for the split-off of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated.
NEW YORK, September 17, 2008  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced today the final results of its previously announced offer to its stockholders to exchange all or some of their shares of MetLife common stock for shares of class B common stock of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA.B). The exchange offer was made in connection with the companies' June 2, 2008 announcement of MetLife's intent to split-off substantially all of its 52% interest in RGA. The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight (ET) at the end of Thursday, September 11, 2008.
Under the terms of the exchange offer, MetLife accepted a total of 23,093,689 shares of MetLife common stock in exchange for 29,243,539 shares of RGA class B common stock. Each share of MetLife common stock accepted under the exchange offer was exchanged for 1.2663 shares of RGA class B common stock.
Because the exchange offer was oversubscribed, MetLife accepted only a portion of the number of shares of MetLife common stock that were validly tendered and delivered by MetLife stockholders, on a pro rata basis in proportion to the total number of shares tendered by such stockholder. Of the tendered MetLife common stock, 8.9% was accepted for exchange. In accordance with the terms of the exchange offer, however, stockholders who owned less than 100 shares of MetLife common stock, or an "odd-lot," who validly tendered and delivered all of their shares of MetLife common stock were not subject to proration if they elected for such treatment in the exchange offer.
 
Based on the final count by the exchange agent, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, the final results of the exchange offer were as follows:
Shares of RGA class B common stock (issued in book-entry form) and shares of MetLife common stock tendered but not accepted for exchange will be credited to accounts of tendering stockholders promptly by the exchange agent. In addition, checks in lieu of fractional shares of RGA class B common stock will be delivered or mailed promptly by the exchange agent.
The terms and conditions of the exchange offer are more fully described in an exchange offer prospectus previously filed by RGA and a Schedule TO, as amended, previously filed by MetLife with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Additional Information and Where to Find It
In connection with the exchange offer (which expired at 12:00 midnight (ET) at the end of September 11, 2008), RGA filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-152828), as amended, that included an exchange offer prospectus dated August 11, 2008, and MetLife filed with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO, as amended, that included such exchange offer prospectus and related transmittal materials.
