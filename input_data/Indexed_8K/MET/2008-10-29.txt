Third Quarter Highlights
"During the third quarter, MetLife generated strong top-line growth against the backdrop of an extremely challenging environment," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "This quarter, we once again demonstrated the benefit of having a diverse mix of businesses, a strong balance sheet and high quality investment portfolio. While we clearly are not immune from the volatility in both the credit and equity markets, MetLife is well positioned to continue to meet the needs of our customers and leverage a number of growth opportunities before us."
"With our recently completed $2.3 billion common stock offering, MetLife has further bolstered its strong, excess capital position. And in a sign of our continued commitment to delivering value to our shareholders, our board of directors has declared an annual common stock dividend of $0.74 per share, which is unchanged from the dividend we paid in 2007," added Henrikson.
The dividend will be payable on December 15, 2008 to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2008.
All comparisons of third quarter 2008 results in the segment discussions below are with the third quarter of 2007, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Third Quarter Segment Overview
Institutional Business had operating earnings of $396 million, compared with $467 million in the prior period. Earnings were impacted by lower investment income and less favorable underwriting results in the company's non-medical health business. Institutional Business continued to generate significant top line growth across all of its businesses as total premiums, fees and other revenues grew 30% to reach $4.5 billion.
Institutional Business Earnings of $396 Million
Group life operating earnings for the quarter were $145 million, up 20% from $121 million as the business experienced strong interest margins and favorable underwriting results. In addition, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 7%.
Non-medical health operating earnings were $56 million in the quarter, down from $107 million due to unfavorable underwriting results across the product lines and lower investment income. Premiums, fees and other revenues increased 16%, due to solid growth in all product lines, particularly in dental, which benefited from strong organic growth and a recent dental HMO acquisition.
Retirement & savings operating earnings were $195 million in the quarter compared with $239 million in the third quarter of 2007 due largely to lower investment income. Retirement & savings
 
premiums, fees and other revenues more than doubled to reach $1.1 billion, due to several large pension closeout sales in both the U.S. and U.K.
Individual Business had operating earnings of $218 million, compared with $363 million in the prior period. Poor equity market performance in the 2008 quarter and its impact on fee revenue, as well as the resulting acceleration of deferred acquisition cost amortization and other items, caused a $131 million, net of income tax ($0.18 per diluted common share) decline in Individual Business earnings. This mostly impacted earnings in the annuity business. During the quarter, the segment had solid annuity premiums and deposits and relatively flat total first year premiums and deposits in the life business.
Individual Business Earnings of $218 Million
Annuity operating earnings were $83 million, down from $235 million in the prior period. In addition to the impact of the equity markets, earnings in the annuity business were also affected by lower investment income. In the third quarter of 2008, variable annuity deposits were $3.8 billion, up from $3.5 billion in the second quarter of 2008, but down compared with $4.1 billion in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, variable annuity lapse rates declined and net flows remained positive. Fixed annuity deposits were $499 million, up 80% and 56% over the second quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2007, respectively.
Total life operating earnings for the quarter increased to $123 million from $117 million while total life first year premiums and deposits were $265 million, compared with $278 million.
International Business operating earnings were $144 million in the third quarter of 2008, up 7% from $135 million in the prior period, driven by strong performance in Latin America.
International Business Earnings of $144 Million
For the quarter, total premiums, fees and other revenues grew 12% on a comparable currency basis to $1.2 billion. In the Latin America region, top line growth was driven by Mexico, bolstered in part by an acquisition, and Chile, where annuity deposits were strong compared with the prior period. In the company's Europe region, premium, fee and other revenue growth was due to top line increases throughout the countries in Europe as well as India. In the Asia Pacific region, market conditions negatively impacted sales in Korea as well as in Japan, where annuity deposits were 173 billion yen ($1.6 billion), up from 150 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in the second quarter of 2008, but down from 196 billion yen ($1.7 billion) in the third quarter of 2007.
Auto & Home operating earnings were $101 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with $109 million in the third quarter of 2007. Auto earnings were up 30% versus the prior period. Homeowners earnings were down, driven by catastrophes. In the third quarter of 2008, the segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $27 million, net of income tax, compared with $18 million, net of income tax, in the prior year period.
Auto & Home Earnings of $101 Million
MetLife has a high quality, diversified $324 billion general account portfolio. For the quarter, net realized investment gains, net of income tax, were $456 million, including approximately $485 million, net, in credit-related losses and impairments. These credit-related losses are offset by derivative gains of approximately $745 million, net of income tax, which arose primarily from the
Investments
 
increase in value of the U.S. dollar in the third quarter, as well as the increase in credit default swap spreads.
After income tax, the impact of deferred acquisition costs and other offsets, variable investment income was approximately $120 million ($0.17 per diluted common share) lower than plan, driven mostly by negative hedge fund and private equity returns.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $220 million, compared with $39 million of operating earnings in the third quarter of 2007.
Corporate & Other
As previously announced, the company recorded a $48 million, net of income tax, ($0.07 per diluted common share) accrual related to MetLife's Operational Excellence initiative in the third quarter of 2008. The accrual relates to severance and is expected to result in future annualized savings of approximately $130 million before income tax. MetLife's Operational Excellence plans extend through 2010. While the company expects to incur additional expenses, MetLife anticipates future annual cost savings, before income tax, of at least $400 million from the Operational Excellence initiative.
In addition to investment income in the 2008 quarter being significantly lower, the company also commuted three excess insurance policies for asbestos-related claims during the 2008 quarter, resulting in a $23 million, net of income tax, ($0.03 per diluted common share) reduction in operating earnings.
During the third quarter, MetLife completed its split-off of substantially all of the company's interest in Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA). The split-off transaction resulted in a GAAP loss of $458 million, a statutory gain in excess of $1 billion, and a decrease in MetLife's share count of approximately 23 million shares. MetLife's share of the operating earnings of RGA in the third quarter (approximately $24 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share) is now reflected in discontinued operations. MetLife's share of RGA's operating earnings in all previous periods have been reclassed to discontinued operations.
RGA Transaction
On October 15, 2008, MetLife completed its public offering of 75 million shares of common stock and issued an additional 11.25 million shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. The total offering of 86.25 million shares produced gross proceeds of approximately $2.3 billion. MetLife expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes and potential strategic initiatives.

Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
Income from continuing operations available to common shareholders is a GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income less discontinued operations, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends.
MetLife also analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings available to common shareholders.
Income from continuing operations available to common shareholders can be reconciled to operating earnings available to common shareholders by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; and discontinued operations related to real estate. Discontinued operations other than discontinued operations related to real estate and preferred stock dividends are excluded from both income from continuing operations available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders.
MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Income from continuing operations
 
available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing Income from continuing operations available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.

NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings available to common shareholders to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share to GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release dated October 29, 2008, for the three months ended September 30, 2008, which are available at www.metlife.com.
