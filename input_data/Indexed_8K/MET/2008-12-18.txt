ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
     On December 5, 2008, MetLife, Inc. (the "Company") elected to continue to participate in the debt guarantee component of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ("FDIC") Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the "Program"). Under the terms of the Program, the FDIC will guarantee through June 2012 (or maturity, if earlier) the payment of certain newly-issued senior unsecured debt of the Company and any eligible affiliates. The Company also notified the FDIC that it has elected the option of excluding specified senior unsecured debt maturing after June 30, 2012, from the guarantee before reaching the limits on the amount of guaranteed debt under the Program (approximately $398 million for the Company and approximately $178 million for its affiliate, MetLife Bank, National Association, which may issue debt under its limit as well as the Company's limit). In addition, the Company opted out of the component of the Program that guarantees non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts.
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
