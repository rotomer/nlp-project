MetLife today also reported full year 2008 net income of $3.1 billion, or $4.14 per share, compared with $4.2 billion, or $5.48 per share, for 2007. Operating earnings for 2008 were $2.7 billion, or $3.67 per share, compared with $4.6 billion, or $6.00 per share, for 2007.
 
 
Full Year 2008 Highlights
"In 2008, MetLife generated a strong, 11% increase in top line results in what is clearly the most challenging economic environment we have experienced in decades," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "During the year, we benefited from a flight to quality in the marketplace. Our core businesses continued to grow and we achieved a number of positive results, including higher pension close-out sales as well as strong annuity deposits in both the U.S. and Japan."
"MetLife's capital strength, strong ratings and focus on the long-term will continue to set us apart as we move ahead in 2009. These attributes, along with our diversified businesses and investment portfolio, serve us well," added Henrikson.
Fourth Quarter Segment Overview
All comparisons of fourth quarter 2008 results in the segment discussions below are with the fourth quarter of 2007, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Institutional Business
Institutional Business continued to generate significant top line growth across all of its businesses as total premiums, fees and other revenues grew 18% over the fourth quarter of 2007 to reach $4.2 billion. Institutional Business operating earnings were $272 million, down from $527 million in the prior period due mainly to significantly lower investment income.
Premiums, fees and other revenues in the group life business increased 9% for the quarter due largely to growth in term life premiums. Group life operating earnings were $117 million, up 26% from $93 million as the business continued to experience solid underwriting and investment results, as well as lower expenses.
Non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues increased 13% over the prior period, due to strong growth in all product lines, particularly in dental, which benefited from both organic growth and a recent dental HMO acquisition. Operating earnings for non-medical health were $71 million, down from $98 million, due primarily to lower investment income.
Retirement & savings premiums, fees and other revenues grew 80% over the fourth quarter of 2007 to $689 million, primarily due to several pension closeout sales in the U.K. as well as higher structured settlement sales. Retirement & savings operating earnings were $84 million, down from $336 million, driven mainly by lower investment income.
 
Individual Business
Total Individual Business premiums and deposits grew 58% over the prior period as a result of strong growth in fixed annuity deposits. For the quarter, Individual Business had an operating loss of $106 million, compared with operating earnings of $380 million in the prior period. The decline in earnings was primarily due to the increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other capitalized items, along with lower fee revenue, resulting from the poor equity market performance in the 2008 quarter.
In the annuity business, total deposits grew 91% over the prior period to reach $7.5 billion as fixed annuity deposits grew from $261 million to $4.1 billion. In addition, variable annuity deposits remained strong at $3.4 billion, down from $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. For both fixed and variable annuities, net flows were positive and lapse rates declined.
In the life business, total first year premiums and deposits were $228 million, compared with $307 million. Total life operating earnings were $88 million, down from $181 million due mostly to a decline in investment income.
International Business
In the fourth quarter of 2008, total International premiums, fees and other revenues were $1.0 billion, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior period. The year-over-year performance reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total operating earnings were $94 million, compared with $193 million in the prior period. The fourth quarter of 2008 includes a one time liability adjustment in the Latin America region. In the fourth quarter of 2007, International's earnings were positively impacted by a one time liability reduction and related tax benefits (due to pension regulation changes in the Latin America region) of $105 million ($0.14 per share).
In the Latin America region, premiums, fees and other revenues were $496 million, down from $550 million, largely due to lower annuity sales and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. In the region, earnings were $115 million, down from $166 million, due to the previously mentioned one time benefit in the fourth quarter of 2007.
In the Asia Pacific region, premiums, fees and other revenues (excluding Japan) increased 9% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, annuity deposits were 125 billion yen ($1.3 billion), compared with 139 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in the prior period. Quarterly earnings in the region (excluding Japan) increased to $34 million.
In the European region, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 11% over the prior period to $99 million, reflecting growth in most of the countries in Europe where MetLife operates as well as India. The region had an operating loss of $23 million during the quarter, compared with $1 million in operating earnings in the prior period, reflecting the company's continued investment in expansion of the business throughout the region.
 
Auto & Home
Auto & Home operating earnings were $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, up 9% from $103 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the segment benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $27 million, net of income tax, compared with $25 million, net of income tax, in the prior year period. During the 2008 quarter, Auto & Home also experienced lower auto claim frequencies.
Investments
MetLife has a high quality, diversified $322.5 billion general account portfolio. For the quarter, net realized investment gains, net of income tax, were $1.3 billion, including $403 million, net, in credit-related losses and impairments. These credit-related losses are offset by derivative gains of $1.6 billion, net of income tax, which arose primarily from a decrease in interest rates in the fourth quarter. Derivative gains also include other items which primarily offset in the quarter driven by changes in currency, equity and credit spreads.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, variable income was negative and lower than plan by $540 million, or $317 million ($0.40 per share) after income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs and other offsets, driven mostly by negative returns from hedge funds and real estate funds.
Corporate & Other
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $224 million, compared with a $42 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting lower investment income.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release to net income, net income per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income available to common shareholders, net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
 
Net income available to common shareholders and net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") net income and GAAP net income per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release includes performance measures which are based on methodologies other than GAAP. MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and operating return on common equity. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income available to common shareholders and GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings.
Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other.
Operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
Operating return on common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by average common equity for the period indicated, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.

NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, such as operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings.
