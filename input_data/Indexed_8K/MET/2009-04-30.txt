"During the first quarter, MetLife generated $7.9 billion in premiums, fees & other revenues  a solid result in what continued to be a challenging economic environment," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "We once again demonstrated the benefit of our diverse mix of businesses, which continued to perform well despite the impact that lower investment income and unfavorable equity markets have had on earnings. In the quarter, revenue in several of our group businesses rose; U.S. annuity deposits increased significantly while net flows remained positive; and our International business grew its top line on a constant currency basis."
"MetLife has a strong excess capital position, diversified investment portfolio and ample liquidity, and we remain well positioned for the future," added Henrikson.
 
 
FIRST QUARTER 2009 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of first quarter 2009 results in the segment discussions below are with the first quarter of 2008, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Institutional Business
Institutional premiums, fees & other revenues were down slightly due to lower pension closeout sales, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Offsetting this were higher structured settlement sales and growth in the group life and non-medical health & other businesses. Group life premiums, fees & other revenues were up 5%, as were non-medical health premiums, fees & other revenues due largely to continued growth in the dental business.
Operating earnings for Institutional were $200 million, after income tax, down from $558 million in the prior period, mostly due to lower investment income.
 
Individual Business
Total annuity deposits more than doubled to reach approximately $7.4 billion as fixed annuity deposits grew from $272 million to $3.6 billion and variable annuity deposits increased 17% to $3.7 billion. The growth was driven by higher deposits across all channels. In addition, for both fixed and variable annuities, net flows were significantly positive and lapse rates declined from the fourth quarter of 2008.
Individual had an after-tax operating loss of $98 million, compared with operating earnings of $312 million in the year-ago quarter. The loss was primarily due to the increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs along with lower fee revenue, resulting from the continued poor equity market performance. Investment income was also lower.
International
International premiums, fees & other revenues, on a reported basis, were down from $1.2 billion due to the strength of the dollar against foreign currencies. In Japan, annuity deposits were 172.2 billion yen ($1.8 billion), up from 156.5 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in the prior period due to an increase in fixed annuity deposits.
International's operating earnings were $159 million, compared with $137 million in the prior period. Excluding several one-time adjustments that benefited both quarters, operating earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were relatively unchanged from the year-ago period.
 
Auto & Home
Net written premiums were slightly lower compared with the year-ago quarter and are reflective of current market conditions. Auto & Home operating earnings were $76 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $98 million in the prior period. Earnings in the 2009 and 2008 quarters benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $17 million, net of income tax, and $23 million, net of income tax, respectively. In addition, catastrophes were $4 million, net of income tax, higher than the prior period.
Investments
Net investment income declined to $3.3 billion from $4.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. The lower result was largely due to a decline in variable investment income, which was negative and lower than plan by $508 million, or $321 million ($0.40 per share) after income tax, the impact of deferred acquisition costs and other offsets. The lower variable investment income was driven mostly by negative returns from corporate joint ventures and real estate funds.
For the quarter, the company had net realized investment losses, net of income tax, of $618 million. The net realized investment losses were across a broad range of asset classes, including corporate credits and hybrid securities, and included $584 million, net of income tax, in credit-related losses and impairments.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share are defined as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share less preferred stock dividends, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release includes performance measures which are based on methodologies other than GAAP. MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings, operating earnings per share and operating return on common equity. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and adjustments related to acquisition costs, net of income tax, discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, and noncontrolling interests, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc., excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to acquisition costs, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends, which are recorded in Corporate & Other. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by average MetLife, Inc. common equity for the period indicated, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.
