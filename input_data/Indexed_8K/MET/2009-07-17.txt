Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, July 14, 2009  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced today that it is combining its Institutional and Individual Businesses, as well as its Auto & Home unit, into a single U.S. Business organization. This is a major outcome of the company's strategic review, which was launched two years ago to capitalize on growth opportunities in the changing marketplace. Combining the segments will enhance MetLife's product design and distribution capabilities, streamline its decision making processes and drive profitable growth.
"With this realignment, we are recognizing that we can better serve both employee benefit plan sponsors and individual customers through a single, integrated organization, while preserving our unique franchises," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Employers are increasingly shifting decision making about personal financial and retirement planning to employees. At the same time, both institutions and individuals recognize more than ever the importance of expertise, a strong balance sheet and trustworthiness in an insurance and financial services provider. This new structure will enable us to further strengthen our industry leadership."
"Our Institutional and Individual Businesses have always been complementary, but by bringing them together we will increase our speed in delivering new products and solutions to the market, better leverage our distribution channels, enhance efficiencies, and expand services to our customers. A unified U.S. Business organization creates a stronger growth platform and builds on our financial strength and our strong brand," said Henrikson.
William J. Mullaney, who has served as president of MetLife's Institutional Business since January 2007, has been named president of the U.S. Business organization. In previous roles at MetLife, Mullaney was president of MetLife Auto & Home, served as senior vice president for
 
claims and customer service at Auto & Home and was responsible for MetLife's voluntary benefits business.
"We look forward to integrating our businesses, which will broaden opportunities for our associates and our distribution channels," added Henrikson. "While seamless to our customers, these structural changes will enable us to provide the insurance and retirement products and services best designed to help customers address their challenges."
The changes announced today will be effective August 1, 2009. The integration of the business segments is expected to proceed through the second half of 2009 and be completed in 2010.
