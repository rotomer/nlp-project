NEW YORK, July 30, 2009  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported a second quarter 2009 net loss of $1.4 billion, or $1.74 per share. The net loss reflects net realized gains and losses, including derivative losses of $1.8 billion, after income tax, of which approximately $1 billion, after income tax, was due to the improvement in MetLife's credit spread in the quarter. MetLife reported second quarter 2009 operating earnings of $723 million, or $0.88 per share.

"MetLife generated strong revenues and operating earnings in the second quarter, as we again demonstrated our ability to deliver solid performance in an uncertain economic environment," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Our clients recognize the value of MetLife's strong balance sheet and capital strength, as evidenced by our 6% and 4% top line growth over the first quarter of 2009 and second quarter of 2008, respectively. We had very strong deposits and positive net flows in our U.S. annuity business; Institutional's top line grew 8% over the second quarter of 2008; and our International business continued to perform well."
"The consistent growth in our core businesses has enabled us to achieve noteworthy results despite lower investment income. At the same time, we have been able to successfully make use of the capital markets to further bolster our strong financial position and we are benefiting from the expense management initiatives we have put in place," added Henrikson.
 
 
SECOND QUARTER 2009 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of second quarter 2009 results in the segment discussions below are with the second quarter of 2008, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Institutional Business
Institutional premiums, fees & other revenues were 8% higher, driven by a $195 million increase in the retirement & savings business resulting from several pension closeout sales as well as continued growth in structured settlement sales. In addition, group life and non-medical health premiums, fees & other revenues were up 4% and 3%, respectively.
Operating earnings for Institutional were $306 million, down from $448 million. In the second quarter of 2009, lower net investment income was partially offset by a $21 million ($0.03 per share), after income tax, insurance liability release related to several large institutional annuity contracts. In addition, underwriting results continued to be solid with the exception of the dental business, which experienced higher claim utilization.
 
Individual Business
Total annuity deposits reached $5.5 billion as variable annuity deposits increased 27% to $4.5 billion and fixed annuity deposits grew from $277 million to $949 million. Annuity net flows remained positive for the fifth consecutive quarter while lapse rates declined for the second consecutive quarter. Total life first year premiums and deposits were $238 million, compared with $242 million. A 35% increase in traditional life first year premiums and deposits was offset by lower sales of variable and universal life.
Operating earnings for Individual were $276 million, compared with $322 million. General account growth and improved underwriting margins were more than offset by lower spreads and fee revenue.
International
International premiums, fees & other revenues, on a reported basis, were down from $1.2 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies compared with the second quarter of 2008. In Japan, total annuity deposits were 137.8 billion yen ($1.3 billion), compared with 149.6 billion yen ($1.4 billion). A 45% increase in fixed annuity deposits was more than offset by a decline in variable annuity deposits, reflecting current market conditions.
International's operating earnings were $158 million, compared with $152 million. During the second quarter of 2009, the adverse impact of a stronger U.S. dollar against foreign currencies was offset by lower expenses and approximately $35 million ($0.04 per share), after income tax, in one-time benefits.
Auto & Home
Net written premiums were slightly lower and are reflective of current market conditions. Auto & Home operating earnings were $76 million, compared with $52 million as catastrophe losses declined significantly. In addition, earnings in the second quarters of 2009 and 2008 benefited
 
from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $3 million, after income tax, and $26 million, after income tax, respectively.
Investments
Net investment income was $3.9 billion, up from $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2009 but down from $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, variable investment income was lower than plan by $150 million, or $102 million ($0.12 per share), after income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. The lower variable investment income was driven by negative returns from real estate funds as well as corporate joint ventures.
For the second quarter of 2009, the company had net realized investment losses, after income tax, of $2.6 billion, mostly driven by derivative losses of $1.8 billion, after income tax. The remainder were primarily due to credit-related losses and impairments across a broad range of asset classes, and were consistent with the company's expectations.
MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management efforts  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. During the quarter, an improvement in MetLife's credit spread, which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities, contributed approximately $1 billion, after income tax, to the derivative losses. This reverses derivative gains that occurred in earlier quarters when the credit spread widened. Increases in interest rates and changes in the value of foreign currency-related derivatives also contributed to the loss and are, in general, offset on an economic basis by gains across various assets and liabilities.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release includes performance measures which are based on methodologies other than GAAP. MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings, operating earnings per share and operating return on common equity. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses of consolidated entities and operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting and the impact of MetLife's own credit, net of income tax, each of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and adjustments related to acquisition costs incurred to effect a business combination after January 1, 2009, net of income tax, discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc., excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses of consolidated entities and operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting and the impact of MetLife's own credit, net of income tax; adjustments related to acquisition costs incurred to effect a business combination after January 1, 2009, net of income tax; discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax; and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by average MetLife, Inc. common equity for the period indicated, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.
