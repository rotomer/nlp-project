(NYSE: MET) today reported a third quarter 2009 net loss of $650 million, or $0.79 per share, reflecting net realized investment losses of $1.4 billion, after income tax.

THIRD QUARTER 2009 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of third quarter 2009 results in the segment discussions below are with the third quarter of 2008, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
 
Institutional Business
Institutional premiums, fees & other revenues, excluding pension closeout sales, were up 3% due in part to a 51% increase in structured settlement premiums. In addition, growth in the dental business drove a 3% increase in the non-medical health & other premiums, fees & other revenues, while group life premiums, fees & other revenues grew over 2%.
Operating earnings for Institutional were $311 million, down from $396 million, mostly due to lower net investment income and a $20 million ($0.02 per share), after income tax, reinsurance adjustment.
Individual Business
Total annuity deposits remained strong at $4.0 billion ($3.4 billion in variable annuities/$596 million in fixed annuities), but were down slightly and reflect current market trends. Annuity lapse rates declined for the third consecutive quarter with annuity net flows remaining positive for the sixth consecutive quarter. Total life first year premiums and deposits were $255 million, compared with $258 million. A 50% increase in traditional life first year premiums and deposits was offset by lower sales of variable and universal life.
Operating earnings for Individual grew 10% to $237 million from $215 million. More favorable market conditions and improved underwriting margins drove the increase. Earnings for the annuity business were $105 million, up 27% from $83 million as the lower interest rate environment offset strong equity market performance, with an estimated net impact on earnings of $46 million ($0.06 per share), after income tax.
International
On a constant currency basis, International premiums, fees & other revenues increased due to business growth in the company's three international regions. In particular, the Latin America region benefited from growth in the company's group business in Mexico, while Hong Kong and
 
South Korea drove the increase in the Asia Pacific region. In Japan, total annuity deposits were 126 billion yen ($1.3 billion), compared with 173 billion yen ($1.6 billion). A 27% increase in fixed annuity deposits was more than offset by a decline in variable annuity deposits, reflecting current market conditions in Japan. In the European region, variable annuity deposits increased significantly, primarily due to expanded distribution and greater product acceptance in the United Kingdom.
International's operating earnings grew 30% to $153 million from $118 million. During the third quarter of 2009, the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rates was offset by lower expenses and approximately $14 million ($0.02 per share), after income tax, in one-time benefits.
Auto & Home
Auto & Home's net written premiums were lower, and continued to reflect current market conditions. Operating earnings for Auto & Home were $86 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared with $101 million. Earnings in the third quarters of 2009 and 2008 benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $7 million, after income tax, and $27 million, after income tax, respectively. In addition, catastrophes were lower in the third quarter of 2009.
Investments
Net investment income was $4.0 billion, up from $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2009 and consistent with $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2009, variable investment income was lower than plan by $45 million, or $32 million ($0.04 per share), after income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. Solid performance from securities lending, hedge funds and corporate joint ventures was offset mostly by negative returns from real estate funds.
For the third quarter of 2009, MetLife had net realized investment losses, after income tax, of $1.4 billion, mostly driven by derivative losses of approximately $857 million, after income tax. The remainder was primarily due to credit-related losses and impairments across a broad range of asset classes, and was consistent with the company's expectations.
MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management efforts  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. During the quarter, an improvement in MetLife's own credit spread, which impacts the valuation of certain
 
insurance liabilities, contributed approximately $582 million, after income tax, to the derivative losses. This reverses derivative gains that occurred in earlier quarters when the credit spread widened. The remainder were primarily due to declines in the value of foreign currency-related derivatives and credit default swaps. These derivatives generally are used to offset economic value changes of instruments for which fair value changes are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release includes performance measures which are based on methodologies other than GAAP. MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP measures, including operating earnings, operating earnings per share and operating return on common equity. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses of consolidated entities and operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting and the impact of MetLife's own credit, net of income tax, each of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and adjustments related to acquisition costs incurred to effect a business combination after January 1, 2009, net of income tax, and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) available
 
to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc., excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses of consolidated entities and operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting and the impact of MetLife's own credit, net of income tax; adjustments related to acquisition costs incurred to effect a business combination after January 1, 2009, net of income tax; and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by average MetLife, Inc. common equity for the period indicated, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.
