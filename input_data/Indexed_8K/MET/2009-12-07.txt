Exhibit 99.2
NEW YORK, December 7, 2009  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today announced several financial targets for 2010 as well as its expected results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Members of MetLife's senior management team will share these financial projections with investors and discuss the company's businesses at MetLife's annual investor conference beginning at 8:00 a.m. (ET) today.
"In 2010, we expect operating earnings to grow approximately 50% over 2009 to between $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion, or $4.00 to $4.40 per share," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "In addition to a 6% to 8% increase in premiums, fees & other revenues, our disciplined pricing and underwriting, improving investment margins, higher variable investment income and lower expenses will enable us to deliver significant earnings growth. Combined, these factors will also increase MetLife's operating return on equity to approximately 10% for 2010 and generate further ROE improvements beyond next year."
2010 Projections & Guidance
 
MetLife's 2010 operating earnings projection does not reflect an anticipated charge of $30 million ($0.04 per share), after income tax, related to MetLife's Operational Excellence initiative, which is focused on reducing complexity, increasing productivity, accelerating growth and improving the effectiveness of the company's operations.
Premiums, fees & other revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 are expected to be between $8.5 billion and $9.1 billion, up approximately 7% from $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, premiums, fees & other revenues are expected to be between $33.2 billion and $33.8 billion, up approximately 2% from $32.9 billion in 2008.
Estimated Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2009 Revenue
"During 2009, we generated growth in premiums, fees & other revenues during one of the most difficult operating environments seen in decades," added Henrikson. "We have leveraged the tremendous scale in our businesses, increased market share and further strengthened our leadership positions in a number of insurance and retirement product lines."
For the fourth quarter of 2009, MetLife expects to report operating earnings between $740 million and $785 million ($0.90 to $0.95 per share), up significantly from $132 million ($0.17 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Estimated Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2009 Operating Earnings
"For the full year 2009, we expect to deliver between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion ($2.81 to $2.86 per share) in operating earnings, despite the various economic challenges," continued Henrikson. "In addition to growing premiums, fees & other revenues over 2008, we also made significant progress on our Operational Excellence initiative in 2009, having achieved our goal of at least $400 million in pre-tax annualized savings one year ahead of our target. As a result, we are increasing our pre-tax annualized savings goal by $200 million to reach $600 million by year-end 2010."
MetLife's fourth quarter and full year 2009 operating earnings expectations do not reflect the annual review of assumptions related to deferred acquisition costs and other adjustments. This review will be finalized later in the fourth quarter and is anticipated to have a positive impact on both fourth quarter and full year 2009 results.
MetLife's full year 2008 operating earnings were $2.7 billion ($3.62 per share).
"Our investment portfolio continues to benefit from the proactive steps we took to reposition the portfolio prior to the recession. Over the course of 2009, net realized after-tax investment losses have continued to decline in line with our expectations and, excluding derivatives, are expected to represent less than 1% of our roughly $340 billion general account portfolio for 2009. We also expect our book value to increase to approximately $41 per share at the end of the year  a 49% increase over 2008. Furthermore, with our strong liquidity, we are well positioned to capitalize on future investment opportunities," added Henrikson.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2009, MetLife expects net income to be between $340 million and $485 million ($0.41 to $0.59 per share), compared with $954 million ($1.20 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2008 net income benefited from net realized investment gains, after income tax, of $1.4 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion, after income tax, were due to derivative gains.
Estimated Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2009 Net Income
MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses.
The derivative losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company, but are reflected in MetLife's net income. During the first nine months of 2009, for example, an average 350 basis point improvement in MetLife's own credit spread contributed approximately $1 billion, after income tax, to derivative losses of $2.6 billion, after income tax. Therefore, MetLife expects a full year 2009 net loss between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion ($2.64 to $2.82 per share).
MetLife will hold its annual investor conference today from 8:00 a.m. to approximately 12:30 p.m. (ET). A live audio and video Webcast of the conference, along with the presentation materials, will be available at www.metlife.com (through a link on the Investor Relations page). A replay of the conference will be available at MetLife's Web site beginning shortly after the conference ends on Monday, December 7, until 11:59 p.m. (ET) on Monday, December 14, 2009. The conference and the accompanying presentation materials will include statements relating to the business, operations, management and financial results of MetLife, Inc., including its prospects for the remainder of 2009, as well as for 2010 and beyond.
Audio & Video Webcast
Assumptions included in MetLife's estimated fourth quarter and full year 2009 and projected full year 2010 results are discussed in detail in the slide presentations to be presented at MetLife's annual investor conference, which are included in a Current Report on Form 8-K that is being furnished today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release includes performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). MetLife analyzes its performance using so-called non-GAAP
 
measures, including operating earnings, operating earnings per share and operating return on common equity. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses of consolidated entities and operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting, net of income tax, each of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and adjustments related to acquisition costs incurred to effect a business combination after January 1, 2009, net of income tax, discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share and operating return on common equity should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share and return on common equity, respectively.
Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc., excluding net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income tax; adjustments related to net investment gains and losses of consolidated entities and operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting, net of income tax; adjustments related to acquisition costs incurred to effect a business combination after January 1, 2009, net of income tax; and discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred stock dividends. Scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders by average MetLife, Inc. common equity for the period indicated, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.
For the historical periods presented, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in either the slide presentations or the Appendix of the presentation materials, and are on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife, Inc.'s website (www.metlife.com). Additional information about MetLife's historical financial results is available in MetLife, Inc.'s Quarterly Financial Supplements for the corresponding periods which may be accessed through MetLife, Inc.'s website. The non-GAAP measures used in this press release should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
In this press release, MetLife provides guidance on its future earnings and earnings per diluted common share on an operating and non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide other than a range of net
 
investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or without the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
