Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009, MetLife has adopted a new presentation format for its Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS"). The new presentation reflects MetLife's recently realigned operating segments and other modifications to the presentation of its financial results, which are intended to improve investors' understanding of MetLife's business segments.
     As previously announced, MetLife has combined its Institutional and Individual Businesses, as well as its Auto & Home Unit, into a single U.S. Business organization. U.S. Business consists of Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and Auto & Home. The former Institutional Business & Individual Business segments have been reclassified into the following three segments:
     The financial reporting format for the Auto & Home segment, which is also part of U.S. Business and consists of MetLife's property & casualty insurance products, remains unchanged from prior periods. MetLife also is now providing additional detail on the results of its banking operations within Banking, Corporate & Other and additional statistical data.
     As a result of the abovementioned developments, MetLife has recast the information presented in its QFS for the quarters ended December 31, 2008, March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. These historical periods have been recast to reflect MetLife's realigned operating segments and conform to the new presentation format to be used effective with the QFS for the fourth quarter of 2009. There have been no changes to MetLife's consolidated operating earnings or net income for these historical periods as a result of recasting the financial results.
     The Financial Supplement Historical Results attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K is furnished and not filed pursuant to instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE:
The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes certain operating and statistical measures, such as sales and product spreads, among others, to provide supplemental data regarding the performance of our current business. The QFS also includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is our measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife's senior management's performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
In this QFS, operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc. excluding:
Operating earnings does not include the following related to net investment gains and losses: (i) amortization of deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired, (ii) amortization of unearned revenue, and (iii) changes in policyholder dividend obligation, all net of income tax. Operating earnings includes scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment, net of income tax. Operating earnings also reflects adjustments for all items mentioned above relating to operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting.
In this QFS, operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income (loss), operating earnings available to common shareholders to GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share to GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS, which is available at www.metlife.com.
