NEW YORK, February 2, 2010  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported fourth quarter 2009 net income of $289 million, or $0.35 per share, which reflects net investment gains and losses. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $793 million, or $0.96 per share.

MetLife today also reported a full year 2009 net loss of $2.4 billion, or $2.89 per share, reflecting net investment losses of $5.1 billion, after income tax. Included in the net investment losses were derivative losses of $3.2 billion, after income tax. MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Changes in the value of these derivatives are, in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Derivative losses related to the tightening of MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  do not have a direct economic impact on the company.
Operating earnings for the full year 2009 were $2.4 billion, or $2.87 per share.
 
 
"MetLife delivered a very strong fourth quarter, with operating earnings significantly higher than a year ago, and both our fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings are above the estimates we provided at Investor Day in December," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Our businesses throughout the U.S. and internationally have performed very well, generating a 14% increase in premiums, fees & other revenues over the fourth quarter of 2008, and a 4% increase over full year 2008 despite a difficult economic environment. Furthermore, in 2009 we had solid underwriting, better expense margins as well as both improving investment income and declining investment losses."
FULL YEAR 2009 SUMMARY
"MetLife's strong brand and capital position make us well-positioned to continue delivering long-term value for both our customers and our shareholders in 2010. We have already started to see the benefits of our new U.S. Business organization and we will continue to invest in our International business to capitalize on future growth opportunities. At the same time, we are building on the savings we achieved in 2009 with actions that will drive greater operational efficiencies," added Henrikson.
 
FOURTH QUARTER 2009 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of fourth quarter 2009 results in the segment discussions below are with the fourth quarter of 2008, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release. Further financial information on MetLife's business segments can be found in the Fourth Quarter 2009 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations page of www.metlife.com.
Beginning with the fourth quarter and full year 2009 periods, MetLife is reporting results under its new U.S. Business organization. U.S. Business consists of Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and Auto & Home.
The former Institutional Business & Individual Business segments have been reclassified into the following three segments:
 
The financial reporting format for the Auto & Home segment, which is also part of U.S. Business and consists of the company's property & casualty insurance products, remains unchanged from prior periods.
MetLife is now also providing details on the financial results of MetLife Bank within Banking, Corporate & Other. MetLife Bank provides forward and reverse mortgages as well as savings products.
All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new reporting structure.
U.S. BUSINESS
Insurance Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products, which includes group life, non-medical health and individual life insurance, were up 8%, reflecting growth across all the product groups. Revenue growth in both group life and individual life was solid, while non-medical health benefited from growth in the dental business.
In individual life, sales (as defined in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures section of this release) were up 17% as increases in whole, term and universal life offset a decline in variable life, reflecting current market trends.
Insurance Products operating earnings were $400 million, up 55% due in large part to higher net investment income, solid underwriting results in both group life and individual life, as well as the positive impact of the unlocking of deferred acquisition costs and other adjustments in individual life.
Retirement Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products were $732 million, up 32% on increased sales of immediate annuities and higher fee income. Total annuity sales continued to be strong at $4.2 billion, up from $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Sales were down from a record $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, which benefited from a high demand for fixed annuities. In variable annuities, demand remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2009 as sales grew 8% over both the third quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, total
 
annuity lapse rates declined for the fourth consecutive quarter with annuity net flows continuing to be positive for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Retirement Products operating earnings were $207 million, up from a $204 million operating loss. The fourth quarter of 2009 benefited from increased fee revenue due to higher equity market levels, the positive impact of the unlocking of deferred acquisition costs and other adjustments as well as a significant improvement in net investment income. The fourth quarter of 2008 was negatively impacted by the increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other adjustments, as well as lower fee revenue due to the poor equity market conditions.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding, which includes the company's U.S. and U.K. pension closeout business, structured settlements and related benefit funding products, were $1.0 billion, up 26% largely due to a 66% increase in structured settlement premiums as MetLife continued to gain market share. In addition, pension closeout premiums increased 7%.
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings were $191 million, up 72% largely due to improved interest spreads.
Auto & Home
Net written premiums for Auto & Home were solid at $698 million, but down 1%, reflecting current market conditions. Operating earnings were $84 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $112 million. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008 benefited from favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $9 million, after income tax, and $27 million, after income tax, respectively. In addition, catastrophes were lower in the fourth quarter of 2009. Auto & Home's combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 91.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with 82.9%.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
International premiums, fees & other revenues grew 22% to $1.2 billion due to business growth across the company's three international regions. In the Latin America region, premiums, fees & other revenues grew 18% due to strong growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil. Premiums, fees & other revenues grew 25% in the Asia Pacific region, primarily due to growth in South Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, in Japan, total annuity sales were 96 billion yen ($1.1 billion), compared with 125 billion yen ($1.3 billion). An 18% increase in fixed annuity sales was more than offset by a decline in variable annuity sales, reflecting current market conditions in Japan. In the EMEI (Europe/Middle East/India) region, premiums, fees & other revenues were up 32% due to growth primarily in India.
 
International operating earnings were $21 million, down 73%. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the double-digit business growth across all regions was more than offset by the previously discussed charge related to changes in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on certain inflation-indexed fixed maturity securities.
*Premiums, fees & other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. The constant currency basis amounts for both periods are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates of the fourth quarter of 2009.
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Total operating revenues for MetLife Bank were $377 million, up 80% as mortgage production and servicing revenue grew and net interest margins remained strong. Total assets at December 31, 2009 were $14.1 billion, up 37% from $10.3 billion at December 31, 2008 reflecting loan and deposit growth. MetLife Bank operating earnings were $65 million, up significantly from $13 million.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $175 million, down 26%. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the company recorded $62 million ($0.08 per share), after income tax, in Operational Excellence charges and certain one-time expenses.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $4.0 billion, up from $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 and consistent with $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, variable investment income was above plan by $40 million ($0.05 per share), after income tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. Strong performance from corporate joint ventures and hedge funds was offset by negative returns from real estate funds.
Compared with the first three quarters of 2009, net investment losses continued to decline and, in the fourth quarter, were $557 million, after income tax. Approximately $527 million, after income tax, of these total net investment losses were derivative losses. The remainder was due to net losses and impairments across a broad range of asset classes, and was consistent with the company's expectations.
MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. During the quarter, an improvement in MetLife's own credit spread contributed
 
approximately $213 million, after income tax, to the derivative losses. Derivative losses related to the tightening of MetLife's own credit spread do not have a direct economic impact on the company and reflect the reversal of derivative gains that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009, when MetLife's credit spread widened. The remainder of the derivative losses was mostly due to increases in interest rates, which are, in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities.
Recent Developments
Currently, MetLife is in discussions with American International Group, Inc. about acquiring its subsidiary, American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), an international life insurance company. No agreement has been reached and there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached.
"Because MetLife is financially strong and has a deep management team, we are in a very good position to pursue acquisitions that are strategic and would accelerate our long-term growth. If we reach an agreement, it will be because the transaction meets our criteria for acquisitions, including having the potential to generate long-term value for both shareholders and customers," said Henrikson.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings, operating earnings per share and operating return on equity should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share and operating return on common equity, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release include performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). MetLife, Inc. analyzes its performance using financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and operating return on common equity, that are not based on GAAP. MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and operating return on common equity should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share and return on common equity, respectively. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is
 
also a measure by which MetLife's senior management's performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc., less preferred stock dividends, excluding the following:
(i) net investment gains and losses;
(ii) changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value fluctuations;
(iii) discontinued operations other than discontinued real estate; and
(iv) costs related to business combinations (since January 1, 2009) and noncontrolling interests,        all net of income tax.
Operating earnings does not include the following related to net investment gains and losses: (i) amortization of deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired, (ii) amortization of unearned revenue, and (iii) changes in policyholder dividend obligation, all net of income tax. Operating earnings includes scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment, net of income tax. Operating earnings also reflects adjustments for all items mentioned above relating to operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting.
Operating earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated. Operating return on common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings by average common equity for the period indicated, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
