"MetLife delivered very strong first quarter results, generating significant earnings growth, growing premiums, fees & other revenues by 12% and increasing net investment income by 31%," said C. Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Improved equity market levels, solid underwriting results and our expense savings efforts also contributed to our strong performance in the quarter.
"The strong growth we achieved in both our U.S. and International Businesses in the first quarter positions us well for continued revenue and earnings growth during the remainder of 2010. With our well-established leadership in the U.S. and our pending acquisition of Alico, we are poised to increase our global market share and provide valuable financial solutions to an expanded client base," added Henrikson.
 
 
FIRST QUARTER 2010 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of first quarter 2010 results in the segment discussions below are with the first quarter of 2009, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the First Quarter 2010 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
U.S. BUSINESS
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were up 2%, largely driven by an increase in group life. In non-medical health, revenue grew slightly as growth in the dental business was offset by a decline in disability. In individual life, sales were up 15% driven by increases in whole, term and universal life insurance.
Insurance Products
 
Operating earnings for Insurance Products were $298 million, up 92% due in large part to higher net investment income, favorable group life underwriting results and lower expenses.
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products  which includes individual and institutional annuities  were $684 million, up 27% on increased fee revenue. Total annuity sales were $4.4 billion, down from $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009, which benefited from an unusually high demand for fixed annuities. Sales of variable annuities continued to grow in the first quarter of 2010, rising 8%.
Retirement Products
Operating earnings for Retirement Products were $159 million, compared with a $118 million operating loss. First quarter 2010 results benefited from increased fee revenue due to higher equity market levels, as well as improved net investment income. First quarter 2009 results were negatively impacted by the increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs as well as lower fee revenue.
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other corporate benefit funding products  were $920 million, up from $433 million due to significant growth in pension closeout premiums, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, structured settlement premiums grew 60%.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings were $228 million, up significantly from $65 million largely due to improved interest spreads.
Net written premiums for Auto & Home  which includes property and casualty insurance products  were $697 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year period. Operating earnings were $72 million, compared with $76 million. First quarter 2010 results benefited from $5 million, after tax, of favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years, compared with $17 million, after tax. Also, catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2010 were $25 million, after tax, compared with $20 million, after tax. Auto & Home's combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  was 88.8%, compared with 88.1%.
Auto & Home
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
International premiums, fees & other revenues were $1.2 billion up 27% due to business growth across the company's three international regions and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In the Latin America region, premiums, fees & other revenues grew 28% (12% on a constant currency basis) due to growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil. Premiums, fees & other revenues grew 24% (6% on a constant currency basis) in the Asia Pacific region, primarily
 
due to growth in Hong Kong. In Japan, total annuity sales were 85 billion yen ($932 million), compared with 172 billion yen ($1.8 billion), reflecting current market trends. In the EMEI (Europe/Middle East/India) region, premiums, fees & other revenues were up 30% (20% on a constant currency basis) due to growth primarily in India.
International operating earnings were $151 million, up 15% as business growth across all regions was partially offset by a $13 million ($0.02 per share) charge due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives.
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Total operating revenues for MetLife Bank were $299 million, down 20% as the first quarter of 2009 results benefited from significant mortgage refinancing activity. Likewise, total assets at March 31, 2010 were $13.6 billion, down 8% from $14.8 billion at March 31, 2009 primarily due to a lower amount of loans held-for-sale. MetLife Bank operating earnings were $53 million, down from $77 million.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $127 million, compared with an operating loss of $255 million. In addition to the previously mentioned charge associated with future retiree health care costs, the company also recorded $20 million ($0.02 per share), after tax, in Operational Excellence charges and certain one-time items.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $4.3 billion, up 31% from $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2009 and up 7% from $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, variable investment income was $314 million ($200 million, after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs). Strong performance from corporate joint ventures and hedge funds was partially offset by negative returns from real estate funds.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $2 million, after tax, net investment gain. This included approximately $19 million, after tax, in derivative losses. MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.
MetLife will hold its first quarter 2010 earnings conference call and audio Webcast on Friday, April 30, 2010, from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. (ET). The conference call will be available live via telephone and the Internet. To listen over the telephone, dial (612) 326-1011 (domestic and

All references in this press release (except in this section) to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release include performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). MetLife, Inc. analyzes its performance using financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on GAAP. MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss), GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net investment gains (losses), (ii) less amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses), (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments that are hedges of investments but do not
 
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (iv) plus income from discontinued real estate operations and (v) plus, for operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting, the aforementioned adjustments and those identified in the definition of operating expenses, net of income tax, if applicable to these joint ventures.
Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value fluctuations related to experience-rated contractholder liabilities and certain inflation-indexed liabilities, (ii) less costs related to business combinations (since January 1, 2009) and noncontrolling interests, (iii) less amortization of deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and (iv) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not reflect the consolidation of certain securitization vehicles that are variable interest entities as required under GAAP.
International premiums, fees & other revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $933 million and $1.1 billion, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. Latin America premiums, fees & other revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $471 million and $539 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. Asia Pacific premiums, fees & other revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $365 million and $430 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. EMEI premiums, fees & other revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $97 million and $105 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. The constant currency basis amounts for both periods are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates of the first quarter of 2010.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
