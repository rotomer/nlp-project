SECOND QUARTER 2010 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of second quarter 2010 results in the segment discussions below are with the second quarter of 2009, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Second Quarter 2010 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
U.S. BUSINESS
Insurance Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were up 2%, largely driven by an increase in group life.
 
In non-medical health, revenue growth in the dental business was offset by a decline in disability. In individual life, premiums, fees & other revenues increased slightly.
Operating earnings for Insurance Products were $369 million, up 29% due to favorable underwriting, higher net investment income and lower expenses.
Retirement Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products  which includes the company's U.S. annuity products  were $766 million, up 34% largely on increased fee revenue. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, total annuity sales were up 10%, including an 11% increase in variable annuity sales.
Operating earnings for Retirement Products were $238 million, up 66%. During the second quarter of 2010, gains from the company's hedge program more than offset the impact of lower equity markets and interest rates. In addition, results also benefited from improved net investment income.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other corporate benefit funding products  were $688 million, down 17% due to lower pension closeout sales, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. In addition, structured settlement premiums grew 9%.
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings were $238 million, up 54% largely due to higher net investment income.
Auto & Home
Net written premiums for Auto & Home were $764 million, up 2%. Operating earnings were $73 million, down 4% largely due to a $20 million, after tax, increase in catastrophe losses over the second quarter of 2009. Catastrophe losses also were $11 million, after tax, higher than expected in the second quarter of 2010. Favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years was $12 million, after tax, compared with $3 million, after tax in the second quarter of 2009. Excluding catastrophes, Auto & Home's combined ratio was 85.5%, compared with 88.0% in the second quarter of 2009.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
International premiums, fees & other revenues were $1.2 billion, up 21% with business growth across the company's three international regions. In the Latin America region, premiums, fees & other revenues grew 23% (15% on a constant currency basis) due to growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil. Premiums, fees & other revenues grew 20% (11% on a constant currency basis) in the Asia Pacific region due to growth in South Korea and Hong Kong. In the EMEI (Europe/Middle
 
East/India) region, premiums, fees & other revenues were up 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis due to growth in India and the European variable annuity business.
International operating earnings were $145 million, down 8% as business growth was offset by the impact of lower equity markets in Japan.
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Total operating revenues for MetLife Bank were $337 million, down 16% due to lower mortgage refinancing activity. Total assets at June 30, 2010 were $14.5 billion, down slightly from June 30, 2009. MetLife Bank operating earnings were $67 million, down $9 million.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $108 million, compared with an operating loss of $170 million. The second quarter of 2010 benefited from higher net investment income.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $4.1 billion, up 7% from $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2009 and down slightly from $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, variable investment income was $296 million ($192 million, after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs), largely due to strong performance from private equity funds.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $767 million, after tax, net investment gain, which was primarily due to derivative gains. MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release (except in this section) to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release include performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). MetLife, Inc. analyzes its performance using financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on GAAP. MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net investment gains (losses), (ii) less amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses), (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (iv) plus income from discontinued real estate operations and (v) plus, for operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting, the aforementioned adjustments, those identified in the definition of operating expenses and changes in fair value of hedges of operating joint venture liabilities, all net of income tax.
 
Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value fluctuations related to experience-rated contractholder liabilities and certain inflation-indexed liabilities, (ii) less costs related to business combinations (since January 1, 2009) and noncontrolling interests, (iii) less amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and (iv) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not reflect the consolidation of certain securitization vehicles that are variable interest entities as required under GAAP.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
Constant Currency Comparison
International premiums, fees & other revenues in the second quarter of 2009 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. Latin America premiums, fees & other revenues in the second quarter of 2009 were $503 million and $538 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. Asia Pacific premiums, fees & other revenues in the second quarter of 2009 were $408 million and $440 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. EMEI premiums, fees & other revenues in the second quarter of 2009 were $94 million on both a reported and constant currency basis. The constant currency basis amounts for both periods are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates of the second quarter of 2010.
