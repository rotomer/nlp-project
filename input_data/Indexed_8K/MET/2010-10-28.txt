A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.3 and is incorporated herein by reference. The press release may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

THIRD QUARTER 2010 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of third quarter 2010 results in the segment discussions below are with the third quarter of 2009, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Third Quarter 2010 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
U.S. BUSINESS
Insurance Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were $5.0 billion, down slightly as growth in the group life and non-medical health businesses was offset by lower individual life revenues. Operating
 
earnings for Insurance Products were $345 million, up 14% due to favorable underwriting, higher net investment income and lower expenses.
Retirement Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products  which includes the company's U.S. annuity products  were $738 million, up 11% due to increased fee revenue. Total annuity sales increased 25% due to strong growth in variable annuity sales. Operating earnings for Retirement Products were $149 million, up 42% due to growth in the business and higher net investment income.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other corporate benefit funding products  were $618 million, down 13% as lower pension closeout sales (which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter) offset a slight increase in structured settlement premiums. Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding were $189 million, up 35% primarily due to higher net investment income.
Auto & Home
Net written premiums for Auto & Home grew 3% to $780 million. Operating earnings were strong at $81 million. Catastrophe losses were $10 million, after tax, higher than in the third quarter of 2009, but were also $10 million lower than expected in the third quarter of 2010 due to light hurricane-related loss activity. Favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years was $3 million, after tax, compared with $7 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding catastrophes, Auto & Home's combined ratio was 88.2% in the third quarter of 2010, compared with 87.7%.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
International premiums, fees & other revenues were $1.3 billion, up 16% with business growth across the company's three international regions. In the Latin America region, premiums, fees & other revenues grew 21% (16% on a constant currency basis) due to growth in all countries in the region, driven by a strong increase in Chile. Premiums, fees & other revenues grew 11% (6% on a constant currency basis) in the Asia Pacific region largely due to growth in Korea and Hong Kong. In the EMEI (Europe/Middle East/India) region, premiums, fees & other revenues were up 7% (11% on a constant currency basis) due to growth in India and the European variable annuity business.
International operating earnings were $191 million, up 25% due to growth in the business as well as one-time tax-related benefits of $38 million ($0.04 per share).
 
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Total operating revenues for MetLife Bank were $410 million, up 8% due to higher mortgage servicing revenue. Total assets at September 30, 2010 were $16.6 billion, up 26% from September 30, 2009. MetLife Bank operating earnings were $101 million, up 26%.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $178 million, compared with an operating loss of $148 million. Higher net investment income in the third quarter of 2010 was offset by $57 million ($0.06 per share) in one-time tax-related items, including a true up to reflect a higher estimated tax rate for the company.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $4.3 billion, up 10% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 5% from the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter of 2010, variable investment income was $292 million ($186 million, after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs), driven by strong performance from private equity funds.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $72 million, after tax, net investment portfolio loss and $190 million, after tax, in derivatives losses. MetLife uses derivatives  in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy  to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release (except in this section) to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings and operating earnings per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release include performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). MetLife, Inc. analyzes its performance using financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on GAAP. MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net investment gains (losses) and net derivatives gains (losses), (ii) less amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivatives gains (losses), (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (iv) plus income from discontinued real estate operations and (v) plus, for operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting, the aforementioned adjustments, those identified in the definition of operating expenses and changes in fair value of hedges of operating joint venture liabilities, all net of income tax.
Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value fluctuations related to experience-rated contractholder liabilities and certain inflation-indexed liabilities, (ii) less costs related to business combinations and
 
noncontrolling interests, (iii) less amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivatives gains (losses) and (iv) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not reflect the consolidation of certain securitization entities that are variable interest entities as required under GAAP.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
Constant Currency Comparison
International premiums, fees & other revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were approximately $1.1 billion on a reported and constant currency basis. Latin America premiums, fees & other revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were $556 million and $581 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. Asia Pacific premiums, fees & other revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were $431 million and $451 million, on a reported basis and constant currency basis, respectively. EMEI premiums, fees & other revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were $107 million and $104 million, on a reported and constant currency basis, respectively. The constant currency basis amounts are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates of the third quarter of 2010.

This QFS also includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, which do not equate to and should not be viewed as substitutes for generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively.

Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife's senior management's and other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of income tax.

In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not reflect the consolidation of certain securitization entities that are variable interest entities ("VIEs") as required under GAAP.
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, operating earnings available to common shareholders to GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share to GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release dated October 28, 2010, for the three months ended September 30, 2010, which are available at www.metlife.com.
