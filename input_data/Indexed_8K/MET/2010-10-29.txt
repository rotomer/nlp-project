On October 29, 2010, MetLife Worldwide Holdings, Inc. ("MLWH"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., entered into a share purchase agreement with its joint venture partner, MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. ("MS&AD"), for the sale of its interest in Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Co., Ltd. ("MSI MetLife"), a Japan domiciled life insurance company, to MS&AD. The purchase price will be 22,525,000,000 (approximately US$275,000,000). It is anticipated that the sale will close on or about April 1, 2011, subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining required regulatory approvals.
MSI MetLife was established in 2001 as a joint venture between MLWH (then known as CitiInsurance International Holdings, Inc.) and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company, Ltd., a subsidiary and predecessor in interest of MS&AD. MetLife, Inc. acquired an indirect interest in approximately 50% of the capital stock of MSI MetLife when it acquired MLWH as part of its acquisition of substantially all of the international insurance businesses of Citigroup, Inc. in 2005. Other than the joint operation of MSI MetLife and certain arrangements related thereto, MetLife, Inc. conducts no substantial business with MS&AD. MetLife, Inc. and its affiliates will continue to jointly manage and provide operational support to MSI MetLife, consistent with past practice, until the closing. At closing, the joint venture agreement between MLWH and MS&AD will be terminated, and MetLife, Inc. will also terminate its commitment to assist MSI MetLife in maintaining specified levels of statutory capital and surplus and to make such loans to MSI MetLife as may be necessary to ensure that MSI MetLife has sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. Thereafter, a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. will continue to reinsure certain existing and certain new business written by MSI MetLife between the closing date and December 31, 2011.
A copy of the press release announcing the sale of MLWH's interest in MSI MetLife is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
New York, October 29, 2010  MetLife announced today that MetLife Worldwide Holdings, Inc. ("MLWH"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., has entered into an agreement to sell its interest in its Japanese joint venture, Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Co., Ltd. ("MSI MetLife"), to its joint venture partner, MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. ("MS&AD"), for 22,525,000,000 (approximately US$275,000,000). It is expected that the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions (including obtaining required regulatory approvals), will be completed on or about April 1 2011. Upon completion, MSI MetLife will be wholly owned by MS&AD.
"The combination of MetLife's strengths and the local experience of MS&AD has been a key factor in the success of this joint venture. We are pleased to have come to an agreement with MS&AD that is in the best interests of our shareholders, our policyholders and employees in Japan. This transaction also allows MetLife in Japan to concentrate on leveraging our strong market position as a result of the pending Alico acquisition," said Eugene Marks, Executive Vice President of MetLife's International Business.
"MS&AD has been an excellent partner and we wish them success in operating this company as a wholly owned subsidiary. Operating this joint venture with MS&AD has provided us a wealth of knowledge about the highly competitive Japanese market. We now fully turn our attention and resources towards Alico, which greatly increases our market presence with a much broader product set and distribution platforms and customer base," added Marks.
As part of the transaction, MLWH will transfer all of its ownership interest in MSI MetLife to MS&AD and MS&AD will be the sole operator of MSI MetLife once the transaction closes. MSI MetLife will be renamed following the completion of the transfer. Both
 
companies have agreed to continue to work closely to ensure a seamless transition for distribution partners and customers during and after the transfer process.
