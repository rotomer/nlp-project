Robert Henrikson, chairman, president & chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "During the year, we increased premiums, fees & other revenues and also achieved annualized savings above the target of our Operational Excellence initiative. These results, combined with our recently completed acquisition of Alico, have positioned MetLife to deliver strong top and bottom line results in 2011. Furthermore, the integration of Alico is on target, and we are focused on leveraging our many strengths to meet the insurance and retirement income needs of customers across the globe."
 
 
FULL YEAR 2010 SUMMARY
FOURTH QUARTER 2010 SUMMARY
 
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of fourth quarter 2010 results in the segment discussions below are with the fourth quarter of 2009, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Fourth Quarter 2010 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
U.S. BUSINESS
Insurance Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were $5.1 billion, down 4% as an increase in the dental business was offset by declines in other businesses in the segment.
Operating earnings for Insurance Products were $309 million, down 23% as higher net investment income was more than offset by increased amortization of DAC and other adjustments. In addition, group life underwriting results remained solid and were consistent with fourth quarter 2009 results.
Retirement Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products  which includes the company's U.S. annuity products  were $812 million, down $1 million. Total annuity sales increased 28% due to strong growth in variable annuities. In addition, total annuity net flows were strong at $2.2 billion and higher than in both the third quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter of 2009.
Operating earnings for Retirement Products were $175 million, down 17% as higher net investment income and separate account fees were more than offset by the impact of the company's variable annuity hedge program described above as well as less favorable unlocking of DAC and other adjustments.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other corporate benefit funding products  were $513 million, down from $930 million, due to lower pension closeout sales (which fluctuate from quarter to quarter) and a decline in structured settlement premiums, which were very strong in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding were $283 million, up 51% primarily due to higher net investment income.
Auto & Home
Net written premiums for Auto & Home were $729 million, up 4%. Operating earnings were strong at $74 million, but down 12% due to a $23 million increase in catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $13 million higher than expected. Favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years was $16 million, after tax, compared with $9 million, after tax, in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding catastrophes, Auto & Home's combined ratio was 90.0%, compared with 91.8%.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
International premiums, fees & other revenues were $2.1 billion, up 75% as results benefited from the acquisition of Alico and increases in MetLife's other international businesses. In addition to strong results from Japan, total International premiums, fees & other revenues benefited from a 13% increase in Latin America, primarily due to growth in Mexico and Brazil, as well as a 3% increase in Asia Pacific.
International operating earnings were $305 million, up significantly as the segment benefited from strong business growth and the acquisition of Alico. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 from MetLife's existing international businesses were strong at $191 million. Alico's contribution to operating earnings was $114 million.
Changes in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on certain inflation-indexed fixed maturity securities reduced earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 by $104 million and, in the fourth quarter of 2010, benefited earnings by $22 million ($0.03 per share). Fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings also benefited from $15 million ($0.02 per share) of one-time tax-related benefits.
International fourth quarter 2010 results reflect one month of Alico operations due to Alico's fiscal year ending on November 30, 2010.
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Total operating revenues for MetLife Bank were $355 million, down 6% due to lower mortgage servicing revenue. Total assets at December 31, 2010 were $16.3 billion, up 16% from December 31, 2009. MetLife Bank operating earnings were $46 million, down 29%.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $34 million, compared with an operating loss of $175 million. Results in the fourth quarter of 2010 benefited from higher net investment income, $20 million ($0.02 per share) of one-time tax-related benefits and a $27 million ($0.03 per share) legal settlement.
 
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $4.5 billion, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 5% from the third quarter of 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2010, variable investment income was $423 million ($268 million, after tax and the impact of DAC), driven by strong performance from private equity funds.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $4 million, after tax, net investment portfolio loss and $1.0 billion, after tax, in derivative losses. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release (except in this section) to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings, operating earnings per share and book value per share should be read as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and book value per common share, respectively.
Operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating revenues (including net investment income as well as premiums, universal life and investment-type product policy fees & other revenues), operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and book value per common share, excluding accumulated other
 
comprehensive income (AOCI), are not calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).
The historical and forward-looking financial information presented in this press release include performance measures which are based on methodologies other than GAAP. MetLife, Inc. analyzes its performance using financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, that are not based on GAAP. MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the businesses. Operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share and operating return on common equity should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, and return on common equity, respectively.
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) less amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (iv) plus income from discontinued real estate operations, (v) less net investment income related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (vi) plus, for operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting, the aforementioned adjustments, those identified in the definition of operating expenses and changes in fair value of hedges of operating joint venture liabilities, all net of income tax.
Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value fluctuations related to experience-rated contractholder liabilities and certain inflation-indexed liabilities, (ii) less costs related to business combinations and noncontrolling interests, (iii) less amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment
 
gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (iv) less interest credited to policyholder account balances related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (v) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not reflect the consolidation of certain securitization entities that are variable interest entities as required under GAAP.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.

NOTE:
This Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes certain operating and statistical measures, such as sales and product spreads, among others, to provide supplemental data regarding the performance of our current business. This QFS also includes financial measures, such as operating earnings, operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, which do not equate to and should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"): GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, respectively. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, is our measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife's senior management's and other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends and operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share is calculated by dividing operating earnings available to common shareholders by the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the period indicated.
