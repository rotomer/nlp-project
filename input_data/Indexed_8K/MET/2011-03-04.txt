     (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless () the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, () the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or () the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment () includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and () does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified

parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.
     (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and AIG and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the applicable Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and AIG and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and AIG and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus relating to the applicable Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and AIG and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, AIG and the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
pro rata
 
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), () no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and () AIG and the Selling Stockholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which () the net proceeds received by the Selling Stockholder from the sale of Securities exceeds () the amount of any damages which AIG and the Selling Stockholder have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of the applicable Securities in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.

The obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company, AIG or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Act.
     9. .
Defaulting Underwriters
     (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company and the Selling Stockholder (acting on its own or through AIG) shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed
 
periods, the Representatives notify the Company and the Selling Stockholder that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company or the Selling Stockholder (acting on its own or through AIG) notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives, the Company or the Selling Stockholder (acting on its own or through AIG) shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of any defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives, the Company and the Selling Stockholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities to be purchased on such Closing Date, then the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives, the Company and the Selling Stockholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company and the Selling Stockholder (acting on its own or through AIG) shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Selling
 
Stockholder, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, AIG, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     10. . Each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, any of the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees as set forth in Annex IX to this Agreement. The Underwriters agree () that they will not sell the Securities purchased by them hereunder to any purchaser if the number of Securities sold to such purchaser, together with the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under any Equity Units sold to such purchaser in the Concurrent Offering (for the purpose of this determination, giving effect to the conversion of such Equity Units into the minimum number of underlying shares of Common Stock), would exceed 22 million shares, unless approved by the Company, and () that, if fewer than 146,809,712 of the Securities are purchased hereunder by the Underwriters, the number of Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters will be purchased first from the Securities that the Company is selling and second from the Securities that the Selling Stockholder is selling.

The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, AIG, the Selling Stockholder and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company, AIG or the Selling Stockholder or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

     12. . If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company, AIG and the Selling Stockholder shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling Stockholder, as the case may be, as provided herein, the Company, AIG and the Selling Stockholder, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Securities, but the Company, AIG and the Selling Stockholder shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of such Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof, it being understood that AIG and the Selling Stockholder
Effect of Termination of Pricing Agreement or Nondelivery of Securities
 
shall be treated as one entity for purposes of such reimbursement and that the Company, on the one hand, and AIG and the Selling Stockholder, on the other hand, shall be responsible for no more than their share of such expenses based on the number of shares that the Company, on the one hand, and AIG and the Selling Stockholder, on the other hand, propose to sell under the Pricing Agreement.

Switzerland
     This prospectus supplement (and the accompanying prospectus), as well as any other material relating to the common stock which is the subject of the offering contemplated by this prospectus supplement (and the accompanying prospectus), do not constitute an issue prospectus pursuant to Article 652a or Article 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.

The common stock is being offered in Switzerland by way of a private placement, i.e., to a small number of selected investors only, without any public offer and only to investors who do not purchase the common stock with the intention to distribute it to the public. The investors will be individually approached by the issuer from time to time. This prospectus supplement (and the accompanying prospectus) as well as any other material relating to the common stock, is personal and confidential and does not constitute an offer to any other person. This prospectus supplement (and the accompanying prospectus) may only be used by those investors to whom it has been handed out in connection with the offering described herein and may neither directly nor indirectly be distributed or made available to other persons without express consent of the issuer. It may not be used in connection with any other offer and shall in particular not be copied and/or distributed to the public in (or from) Switzerland.

     (c) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder, the directors and officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company, AIG or the Selling Securityholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which the Company, AIG or the Selling Securityholder may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement, or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing
 
Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company, AIG or the Selling Securityholder, as the case may be, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company, AIG or the Selling Securityholder, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless () the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, () the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or () the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment () includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and () does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure

to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.
     (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and AIG and the Selling Securityholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the applicable Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and AIG and the Selling Securityholder on the one hand and the Underwriters of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and AIG and the Selling Securityholder on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the the Selling Securityholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus relating to the applicable Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and AIG and the Selling Securityholder on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of
pro rata
 
the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) AIG and the Selling Securityholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (A) the net proceeds received by the Selling Securityholder from the sale of Securities exceeds (B) the amount of any damages which AIG and the Selling Securityholder have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of the applicable Securities in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
     (f) The obligations of the Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company, AIG or the Selling Securityholder within the meaning of the Act.
     9. .
Defaulting Underwriters
     (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Selling Securityholder (acting on its own or through AIG) shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other
 
parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Selling Securityholder that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Selling Securityholder (acting on its own or through AIG) notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Selling Securityholder (acting on its own or through AIG) shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of any defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Selling Securityholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed ten percent of the aggregate number of  shares of such Securities to be purchased on such Closing Date, then the Selling Securityholder shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of  shares of such Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Selling Securityholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Selling Securityholder (acting on its own or through AIG) shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any
 
nondefaulting Underwriter or the Selling Securityholder, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, AIG, the Selling Securityholder and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     10. . Each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, any of the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees as set forth in Annex IX to this Agreement. The Underwriters agree that they will not sell the Securities purchased by them hereunder to any purchaser if the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under any Securities sold to such purchaser (for the purpose of this determination, giving effect to the conversion of such Securities into the minimum number of underlying shares of Common Stock), together with the number of shares of Common Stock sold to such purchaser in a concurrent offering of 68,570,000 shares of Common Stock by the Company and 78,239,712 shares of Common Stock by the Selling Securityholder (the ""), would exceed 22 million shares, unless approved by the Company.

     11. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, AIG, the Selling Securityholder and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company, AIG or the Selling Securityholder or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
     12. . If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling Securityholder, as the case may be, as provided herein, the Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Securities, but the Company, AIG and the Selling Securityholder shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of such Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof, it being understood that AIG and the Selling

Securityholder shall be treated as one entity for purposes of such reimbursement and that the Company, on the one hand, and AIG and the Selling Securityholder, on the other hand, shall be responsible for no more than their share of such expenses based on the number of Securities that the Company, on the one hand, and AIG and the Selling Securityholder, on the other hand, propose to sell under the Pricing Agreement.
