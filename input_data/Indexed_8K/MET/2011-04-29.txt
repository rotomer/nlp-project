Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
The MetLife, Inc. (the "Company") annual meeting of stockholders was held on April 26, 2011 (the "2011 Annual Meeting"). The matters that were voted upon at the 2011 Annual Meeting, and the number of votes cast for, against, or withheld, as well as the number of abstentions and broker non-votes as to each such matter, as applicable, are set forth below.
At the 2011 Annual Meeting, the stockholders elected one Class II Director for a term expiring at the Company's 2013 Annual Meeting, and four Class III Directors, each for a term expiring at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting.(1) The stockholders approved the proposal to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the Board of Directors(2) and ratified the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent auditor for 2011.(3) The stockholders also approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the Company's 2011 Proxy Statement.(4)
Finally, the stockholders voted, on an advisory basis, on the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers.(5) Because the stockholders' vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation is itself advisory, the result is not binding. The Company expects to publicly disclose within 150 days of the 2011 Annual Meeting its Board of Directors' determination of the frequency with which future advisory votes on executive compensation will be held.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: April 29, 2011
