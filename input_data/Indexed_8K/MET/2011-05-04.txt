FIRST QUARTER 2011 SUMMARY
 
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of first quarter 2011 results in the segment discussions below are with the first quarter of 2010, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the First Quarter 2011 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
U.S. BUSINESS
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were $5.0 billion, down 2%. Operating earnings for Insurance Products were $350 million, up 17% driven by strong underwriting results in group life and non-medical health. Results reflect the company's continued commitment to pricing discipline.
Insurance Products
 
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products  which includes the company's U.S. annuity products  were $867 million, up 13%. Total annuity sales increased 34% to $6.1 billion, driven by strong growth in variable annuities across all distribution channels. In addition, total annuity net flows were strong at $2.6 billion and higher than in both the first and fourth quarters of 2010. Operating earnings for Retirement Products were $212 million, up 5% driven by higher separate account fee income.
Retirement Products
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other corporate benefit funding products  were $405 million, down from $789 million, due to lower pension closeout sales (which fluctuate from quarter to quarter) and a decline in structured settlement sales, which were very strong in the first quarter of 2010. Total assets (general and separate accounts) in Corporate Benefit Funding grew 10% to reach $159.7 billion and operating earnings were $289 million, up 31% primarily due to higher net investment income.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Net written premiums for Auto & Home were $719 million, up 3% due to growth across the business. Operating earnings were $57 million, down 21% largely due to severe weather in the Northeast in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, catastrophe losses were $14 million higher than expected. Favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years was $10 million, after tax, compared with $5 million, after tax, in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding catastrophes, Auto & Home's combined ratio was 92.3%, compared with 88.8%.
Auto & Home
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Premiums, fees & other revenues in Japan were $1.7 billion and reflect strong sales, particularly in life and accident & health insurance, as well as improved persistency. Operating earnings in Japan were strong at $290 million and reflect both growth in the business as well as higher net investment income.
Japan
MetLife currently expects that the impact to the company's second quarter 2011 operating earnings from additional insurance claims and increased operating expenses due to the March 11 earthquake in Japan will be between $45 million and $65 million, after tax.
Premiums, fees & other revenues in MetLife's Other International Regions were $2.1 billion, up 86% largely driven by the Alico acquisition as well as strong performance in the Latin America
Other International Regions
 
and Asia Pacific regions. In Latin America, growth in the institutional business in Mexico, the group life and dental businesses in Brazil and in accident & health insurance in both Chile and Argentina contributed to the region's strong results. In the Asia Pacific region, growth was driven by strong life insurance sales through the agency channel in Korea. Operating earnings in the Other International Regions were also strong at $277 million due to growth in the business.
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Total operating revenues for MetLife Bank were down 8% to $275 million while its operating earnings were $11 million, down from $53 million, reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity. MetLife Bank's total assets at March 31, 2011 were $15.6 billion, up 15% from March 31, 2010.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $68 million, compared with an operating loss of $127 million. Results in the first quarter of 2011 benefited from higher net investment income.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $4.9 billion, up 14% from the first quarter of 2010 and up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, variable investment income was $434 million ($279 million, after tax and the impact of DAC), driven by strong performance from private equity funds.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $29 million, after tax, net investment portfolio loss. The company also reported $254 million, after tax, in derivative losses primarily due to higher interest rates and a weaker U.S. dollar. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.

The conference call will be available live via telephone and the Internet. To listen over the telephone, dial (612) 326-1011 (domestic and international callers).

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues exclude net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
 
The following adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted share, respectively. These reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the First Quarter 2011 Quarterly Financial Supplement and in the tables that accompany this earnings press release.

exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.

Exhibit 99.3
NEW YORK, May 2, 2011  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today announced that its board of directors has appointed Steven J.

Goulart will report to President and Chief Executive Officer Steven A. Kandarian and become a member of MetLife's executive group.
As CIO, Goulart will oversee MetLife's over $450 billion general account portfolio and the more than 650 investment and support professionals in MetLife's investments organization around the world.

Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results.
Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of MetLife, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
