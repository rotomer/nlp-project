MetLife, Inc. (the "Company") estimates $160 million to $180 million, after tax, in catastrophe losses in its Auto & Home business as a result of storm activity in the United States during April and May 2011. This estimate is $133 million to $153 million, after tax, higher than the Company's plan provision of $27 million for these two months.

The month of May had three catastrophes, one of which impacted 20 states and caused severe tornado damage in Missouri, Minnesota and Oklahoma.
The Company's Auto & Home business represented 7% of net income available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders for the first quarter of 2011.
