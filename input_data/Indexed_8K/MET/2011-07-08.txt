Item 8.01 Other Events.
     As previously disclosed in MetLife, Inc.'s (the "Company") filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company entered into replacement capital covenants (each a "Replacement Capital Covenant") on: (i) December 21, 2006, relating to and in connection with the Company's issuance of 6.40% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the "6.40% JSDs"); (ii) December 12, 2007, relating to and in connection with MetLife Capital Trust IV's issuance of 7.875% Fixed-to Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities due 2067 (the "7.875% X-SURPS"), automatically exchangeable in specified circumstances into 7.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 of the Company; (iii) April 8, 2008, relating to and in connection with MetLife Capital Trust X's issuance of 9.250% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities due 2068 (the "9.250% X-SURPS"), automatically exchangeable in specified circumstances into 9.250% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 of the Company; (iv) December 30, 2008, relating to the Company's Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, and 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (collectively the "Preferred Stock"); and (v) July 8, 2009, relating to and in connection with the Company's issuance of 10.750% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2069 (the "10.750% JSDs").
     Each Replacement Capital Covenant is for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's "Covered Debt", as defined in the relevant Replacement Capital Covenant. The Replacement Capital Covenants generally provide that the Company will not repay, redeem or purchase ("repay" or "repayment") the securities to which they relate, unless during a period prior to the repayment the Company has sold certain securities that are not senior to the securities to be repaid and the cash proceeds from such sale meet minimum thresholds.
     The Company's 5.70% Senior Notes due 2035 (the "Senior Notes") were initially designated as the Covered Debt under each of the Replacement Capital Covenants. As a result of the Company's issuance of the 10.750% JSDs, the 10.750% JSDs became the Covered Debt with respect to, and in accordance with the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenants relating to, the 6.40% JSDs and the Preferred Stock. The Senior Notes continue to be the Covered Debt with respect to, and in accordance with the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenants relating to, the 7.875% X-SURPS, the 9.250% X-SURPS and the 10.750% JSDs.
     The foregoing descriptions of the Replacement Capital Covenants are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Replacement Capital Covenants, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
