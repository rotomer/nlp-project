"We grew earnings per share by 13% over the prior-year quarter while generating a record $11.8 billion in premiums, fees and other revenues. The fact that we were able to deliver these results despite losses from natural disasters in the United States and Japan is a testament to the earnings power of MetLife's diverse portfolio of businesses. Our Alico integration work is proceeding on plan and we're well positioned for continued profitable growth that adds shareholder value."
 
 
SECOND QUARTER 2011 SUMMARY
 
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of second quarter 2011 results in the segment discussions that follow are with the second quarter of 2010, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Second Quarter 2011 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
 
U.S. BUSINESS
Operating earnings for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were $449 million, up 22% due to increases in all three business lines. In particular, the rise in earnings was driven by record underwriting results in group life, solid underwriting in non-medical health and higher net investment income. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products were $5.0 billion, relatively unchanged.
Insurance Products
Operating earnings for Retirement Products  which includes the company's U.S. annuity products  were $201 million, up 48% driven by higher separate account fee income. Total annuity sales increased 48% to $7.3 billion, driven by strong growth in variable annuities across all distribution channels. In addition, total annuity net flows were very strong at $3.8 billion and higher than in both the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products were $937 million, up 15% due to higher fee income.
Retirement Products
Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other benefit funding products  were $314 million, up 34% primarily due to higher net investment income. Total general and separate accounts grew a combined 12% to reach $162.9 billion. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding were $900 million, up 53% due to higher pension closeout sales (which fluctuate from quarter to quarter) and higher structured settlement sales.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Auto & Home had an operating loss of $56 million, compared with operating earnings of $73 million as unusually heavy storm activity contributed to catastrophe losses of $174 million, after tax  $137 million higher than the company's quarterly plan provision. The higher losses in the second quarter of 2011 were partially offset by favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $17 million, after tax, compared with $12 million, after tax, in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding catastrophes, Auto & Home's combined ratio was strong at 85.7%, compared with 85.5%. Net written premiums for Auto & Home were $778 million, up 2%.
Auto & Home
 
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Operating earnings in Japan were $245 million, reflecting strong business performance and high net investment income and partially reduced by the previously mentioned claims and expenses due to the March earthquake. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Japan were up 5% over the first quarter of 2011 at $1.8 billion and reflect strong sales in life and accident & health insurance, particularly through face to face distribution channels, as well as improved persistency.
Japan
Operating earnings in the Other International Regions were $262 million, up 85%, while premiums, fees & other revenues grew to $2.2 billion. The increase in both earnings and revenues was largely due to the Alico acquisition. In Latin America, growth in the accident and health business across the region and in the institutional business in Mexico also contributed to the increase in the segment's premiums, fees and other revenues.
Other International Regions
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Operating earnings for MetLife Bank were $14 million, down from $67 million, reflecting higher expenses as well as lower mortgage origination and refinancing. MetLife Bank operating revenues were down 8% to $311 million. At June 30, 2011, total assets were $16.5 billion (including deposits of $10.0 billion), up 13% from June 30, 2010. On July 21, MetLife announced that it is exploring the sale of MetLife Bank's depository business, which includes savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts. MetLife plans to continue offering residential mortgages.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $100 million, compared with an operating loss of $108 million. Results in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from higher net investment income.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $5.1 billion, up 24% from the second quarter of 2010 and up 5% from the first quarter of 2011. During the second quarter of 2011, variable investment income
 
was $425 million ($269 million, after tax and the impact of DAC), driven by strong performance from securities lending and private equity funds.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $38 million, after tax, investment portfolio loss. The company also reported $189 million, after tax, in derivative gains primarily due to lower interest rates. In the second quarter of 2010, MetLife reported $782 million, after tax, in derivative gains. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread  which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, it is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
 
Operating revenues exclude net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
The following adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses,
 
operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted share, respectively. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Second Quarter 2011 Quarterly Financial Supplement and in the tables that accompany this earnings press release.
