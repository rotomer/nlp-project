"During the third quarter, MetLife generated strong results, despite continued challenging economic conditions," said Steven A. Kandarian, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "We increased operating earnings 23%, generated a record $12.0 billion in premiums, fees and other revenues and had strong top line growth in both our U.S. and International Businesses compared with the third quarter of 2010. We also demonstrated that, despite several unusual items during the third quarter, the core fundamentals of our diverse, global businesses are strong, and we remain committed to delivering further value for our customers and our shareholders."
 
 
THIRD QUARTER 2011 SUMMARY
BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of third quarter 2011 results in the segment discussions that follow are with the third quarter of 2010, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Third Quarter 2011 Quarterly Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
 
U.S. BUSINESS
Insurance Products
Operating earnings for Insurance Products  which includes group life, individual life and non-medical health insurance  were $265 million, down 23% largely due to the previously mentioned reserve adjustment, which impacted group and individual life results. Partially offsetting this was a 31% increase in non-medical health earnings, which benefitted from improved investment income and underwriting results. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Insurance Products were $4.9 billion, relatively unchanged.
Retirement Products
Operating earnings for Retirement Products  which includes the company's U.S. annuity products  were $104 million, down 56%. The decrease was largely due to the initial negative impact of declining equity markets, which reduced earnings by $90 million, after tax, as well as lower net investment income. Total annuity sales increased 79% to $9.2 billion due to strong growth in variable annuities across all distribution channels. In addition, total annuity net flows were $5.8 billion, higher than the second quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retirement Products were $1.1 billion, up 39% due to increased sales of immediate annuities and higher fee income.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other benefit funding products  were $264 million, up 45% primarily due to higher net investment income. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding were $854 million, up 65% due to higher pension closeout sales (which often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter) and higher structured settlement sales.
Auto & Home
Operating earnings for Auto & Home were $22 million, down 73% as storm activity, including Hurricane Irene, contributed to catastrophe losses of $88 million, after tax. Partially offsetting this was favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $19 million ($0.02 per share), after tax, compared with $3 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding catastrophes, Auto & Home's combined ratio was strong at 88.0%, compared with 88.2%. Net written premiums for Auto & Home were $807 million, up 3%.
 
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Japan
Operating earnings in Japan were $315 million, up 29% over the second quarter of 2011 due to higher net investment income, reduced claims associated with the March earthquake, lower operating expenses and improved persistency. Sales grew 22% over the second quarter of 2011 and 28% over the third quarter of 2010. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Japan were $1.8 billion.
Other International Regions
Operating earnings in the Other International Regions were $263 million, up 39%, while premiums, fees & other revenues grew to $2.2 billion. The increases were largely due to the Alico acquisition. In addition, in Latin America, growth in premiums, fees & other revenues was driven by higher immediate annuity sales in Chile, as well as premium increases in Mexico and Argentina. In Asia Pacific, increases in institutional business in Australia and in accident & health insurance in Korea drove the growth in premiums, fees & other revenues.
 
BANKING, CORPORATE & OTHER
Operating earnings for MetLife Bank were $51 million, down from $101 million, reflecting higher expenses. Operating revenues rose 4% to $425 million. At September 30, 2011, total assets were $17.7 billion (including deposits of $10.7 billion), up 6% from September 30, 2010. On October 12, MetLife announced that, in addition to its previously announced decision to explore a sale of MetLife Bank's depository business, the company is also exploring a sale of the Bank's forward mortgage origination business.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $105 million, compared with an operating loss of $178 million. Results in the third quarter of 2011 benefited from higher net investment income, partially offset by the previously mentioned charge related to ELNY.
 
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $5.1 billion, up 17% from the third quarter of 2010 and relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, variable investment income was $400 million ($258 million, after tax and the impact of DAC), driven by strong performance from private equity funds and securities lending.
For the quarter, MetLife reported a $14 million, after tax, investment portfolio net gain. Separately, the impact of MetLife's credit spreads contributed $1.3 billion, after tax, to total derivative net gains of $2.7 billion, after tax. Lower interest rates also contributed to the total derivative net gains for the quarter. In the third quarter of 2010, MetLife reported $190 million, after tax, in derivative net losses. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's credit spreads  which impact the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.

Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, it is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues exclude net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL"). The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:

MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Third Quarter 2011 Quarterly Financial Supplement and in the tables that accompany this earnings press release.
