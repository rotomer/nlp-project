Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
As announced in November 2011, MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife") reorganized its business from a U.S. and International business structure into three broad geographic regions to better reflect its global reach. As a result, in the first quarter of 2012, MetLife reorganized into six segments, reflecting these broad geographic regions: Retail Products; Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, "The Americas"); Asia; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). In addition, MetLife reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other, which includes MetLife Bank and other business activities.
In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, MetLife adopted and retrospectively applied the new guidance (ASU 2010-26) regarding accounting for deferred acquisition costs ("DAC"). This guidance specifies that only costs related directly to successful acquisition of new or renewal contracts can be capitalized as DAC; all other acquisition-related costs must be expensed as incurred. Under the new guidance, advertising costs may only be included in DAC if the capitalization criteria in the direct-response advertising guidance in Subtopic 340-20,, are met. As a result, certain direct marketing, sales manager compensation and administrative costs currently capitalized by the Company will no longer be deferred.
Other Assets and Deferred CostsCapitalized Advertising Costs
To reflect the reorganized segments, MetLife has adopted a new presentation format for its Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS"), which will be used beginning with the QFS for the first quarter of 2012. To aid investors' understanding of the impact of the segment reorganization and the new guidance regarding accounting for DAC, MetLife has revised the information presented in its QFS for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011 and attached such revised historical financial results (the "Historical Results Financial Supplement") to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
The Historical Results Financial Supplement attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is furnished and not filed pursuant to instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.

NOTE TO FINANCIALS
This Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes certain operating and statistical measures, such as sales and product spreads, among others, to provide supplemental data regarding the performance of our current business. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife, Inc. ("Divested businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
 
 
 
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted common share, respectively.
