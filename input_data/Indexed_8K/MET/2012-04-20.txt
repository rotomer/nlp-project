Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information described under "Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02. The Historical Results Financial Supplement attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K is furnished and not filed pursuant to instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Shortly after 5:30 PM (Eastern time) on April 18, 2012, MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife") furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Form 8-K revised historical financial results (the "Historical Results Financial Supplement") which revised the information contained in its quarterly financial supplements for each quarter of 2011. The Historical Results Financial Supplement was made available in advance of MetLife's planned earnings announcement for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 to aid investors in understanding the impact of MetLife's reorganization of its business into six segments, reflecting three broad geographic regions, and the adoption and retrospective application of new guidance regarding accounting for deferred acquisition costs, both of which occurred during the first quarter of 2012. Shortly after the Form 8-K was furnished, the Historical Results Financial Supplement was also posted on the Investor Relations section of MetLife's website. On April 19, 2012, MetLife learned that the data in the version of the Historical Results Financial Supplement posted on its website could be accessed in ways to make visible the preliminary financial results of MetLife for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 which were otherwise embedded in the document but were not visible.
Therefore, MetLife has attached a new Historical Results Financial Supplement, which includes MetLife's preliminary financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. In light of the preliminary nature of these financial results, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. Due to the inadvertent early release of this information, MetLife will provide final financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 on April 26, 2012, after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The new Historical Results Financial Supplement attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K is furnished and not filed pursuant to instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.

NOTE TO FINANCIALS
This Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes certain operating and statistical measures, such as sales and product spreads, among others, to provide supplemental data regarding the performance of our current business. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife, Inc. ("Divested businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
 
 
 
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted common share, respectively.
