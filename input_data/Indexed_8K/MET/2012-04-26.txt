Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, April 26, 2012  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported a first quarter 2012 net loss of $174 million, or $0.16 per share, which was driven by derivative net losses of $1.3 billion, after tax, that were largely due to increases in interest rates and MetLife's lower credit spreads during the quarter. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movement in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's credit spreads  which impact the valuation of certain insurance liabilities  can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.
MetLife today also reported first quarter 2012 operating earnings
1
of $1.5 billion, or $1.37 per share.
 
 
 
"MetLife had a very strong first quarter," said Steven A. Kandarian, chairman, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Year over year, we grew premiums, fees & other revenues by 7% and increased operating earnings per share by 11%. These results reflect top line growth in all of MetLife's global regions, sound fundamentals and the core earnings power of our diversified businesses."
SUMMARY
 
 
 
BUSINESS DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of first quarter 2012 results in the business discussions that follow are with the first quarter of 2011, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the First Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, MetLife is reporting results under its new organizational structure, which consists of three broad geographic regions  and  to better reflect the company's global reach.
the Americas, Asia
EMEA
The former U.S. Business and the company's operations in Latin America are now reported in the following segments within :
the Americas
 
 
 
 
The company's businesses outside the United States (other than U.K. pension closeouts) were formerly reported in the Japan and Other International Regions segments. These businesses, other than the company's operations in Latin America, are now reported in and .
Asia
EMEA
All prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the new reporting structure.
Results for the current and all prior periods also reflect the adoption and retrospective application of new guidance regarding accounting for deferred acquisition costs ("DAC").
THE AMERICAS
Total operating earnings for the Americas grew 13% to $1.2 billion while premiums, fees & other revenues grew 7% to $8.3 billion, reflecting growth across all segments.
Retail Products
Operating earnings for Retail Products  which includes U.S. retail life insurance and annuities  were $408 million, up 20% due to higher fees and strong investment margins. The increase in earnings was partially offset by a $26 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax charge for the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders under a multi-state examination related to unclaimed property and MetLife's use of the Social Security Death Master File. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retail Products were $2.5 billion, up 12% due to higher annuity fees, increased sales of income annuities and growth in the retail life business. Variable annuity sales were $4.9 billion, down 13%.
Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits
Operating earnings for Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits  which includes U.S. group life, non-medical health and property & casualty insurance  were $304 million, up 11% mainly due to favorable claims experience in the non-medical health and property & casualty businesses as well as strong investment margins. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits were $4.4 billion, up 3% due to growth across the businesses, including favorable sales and persistency in group life and higher revenues from dental, disability, and property & casualty insurance products.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other benefit funding products  were $298 million, up 3% due to favorable underwriting results. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding were $622 million, up 16% due to higher pension closeout sales (which often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter) and an increase in structured settlement sales.
 
Latin America
Operating earnings for Latin America were $148 million, up 22% due to growth across the region and improved underwriting results. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Latin America were $887 million, up 13% led by higher immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total sales grew 19%, driven by pension sales in Mexico and accident & health sales in Argentina.
ASIA
Operating earnings for Asia were $297 million, up 33% due to growth in the business  particularly in Japan  as well as expense efficiency. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 8% due to business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia, as well as improved persistency in both Japan and Korea. Total sales for the region grew 15%, driven by increases in Japan, China and Australia.
EMEA
Operating earnings for EMEA were $76 million, down 4% due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by growth in the Middle East and Turkey. Premiums, fees & other revenues in EMEA were $899 million, up 9% driven in part by strong persistency across the region. Total sales for the region grew 7% with growth impacted by the challenging economic environment in Europe.
CORPORATE & OTHER
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $68 million, compared with an operating loss of $9 million. First quarter 2012 results were impacted by lower net investment income, lower earnings from MetLife Bank's forward mortgage servicing operations and a $26 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax charge representing a multi-state examination payment related to unclaimed property and MetLife's use of the Social Security Death Master File.
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $5.1 billion, up 6% due to solid recurring income. Variable investment income was within the plan range at $239 million ($155 million, after tax) compared with $283 million ($184 million, after tax) in the first quarter of 2011.
For the first quarter of 2012, MetLife reported a $145 million, after tax, investment portfolio net loss compared with an investment portfolio net loss of $27 million, after tax. Derivative net losses were $1.3 billion, after tax, compared with derivative net losses of $253 million, after tax, in the first quarter of 2011.
Recast Projected 2012 Operating Earnings by Segment
Following the company's reorganization into three geographic regions, MetLife has recast its 2012 projected operating earnings by segment to align with the company's new financial reporting structure. MetLife is not affirming or updating its 2012 projections, which were originally provided on December 5, 2011.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release (except in this section) to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, operating earnings, operating earnings per share, book value per share and premiums, fees and other revenues, should be read
 
as net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and premiums, fees and other revenues (operating), respectively.
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife ("Divested businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
 
 
 
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the First Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement and/or in the tables that accompany this earnings press release.
In this press release, MetLife has recast projections of its future earnings on an operating and non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or without the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
