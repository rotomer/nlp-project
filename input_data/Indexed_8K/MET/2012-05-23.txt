These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information
All references in these presentations (except in this Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information slide) to operating earnings, premiums, fees and other revenues and return on equity, should be read as operating earnings available to common shareholders, premiums, fees and other revenues (operating) and operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, respectively.
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife, Inc. ("Divested Businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to NIGL and NDGL and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") fees ("GMIB Fees");
Net investment income: (i) includes amounts for scheduled periodic settlement payments and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) includes income from discontinued real estate operations, (iii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iv) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (v) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities ("VIEs") consolidated under GAAP; and
Other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges.
4
MetLife
Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information (Continued)
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
 -  Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to NIGL and NDGL, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ("GMIB Costs"), and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ("Market Value Adjustments");
 -  Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for scheduled periodic settlement payments and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments;
 -  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and value of business acquired ("VOBA") excludes amounts related to: (i) NIGL and NDGL, (ii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs, and (iii) Market Value Adjustments;
 -  Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market Value Adjustments;
 -  Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and
 -  Other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements, and (iii) acquisition and integration costs.
Operating return on MetLife, Inc. common equity is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common equity.
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity and operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity and return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, respectively.

Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information (Continued)
For the historical periods presented, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this Appendix to the presentation materials and are on the Investor Relations portion of our Internet website. Additional information about our historical results is also available on our Internet website in our Quarterly Financial Supplements for the corresponding periods.
The non-GAAP measures used in this presentation should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
In these presentations, we sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.
In these presentations, we provide guidance on our future earnings, premiums, fees and other revenues, and return on common equity on an operating or non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or without the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information
All references in these presentations (except in this Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information slide) to operating earnings, premiums, fees and other revenues and return on equity, should be read as operating earnings available to common shareholders, premiums, fees and other revenues (operating) and operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, respectively.
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife, Inc. ("Divested Businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
 -  Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to NIGL and NDGL and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") fees ("GMIB Fees");
 -  Net investment income: (i) includes amounts for scheduled periodic settlement payments and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) includes income from discontinued real estate operations, (iii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iv) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (v) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities ("VIEs") consolidated under GAAP; and
 -  Other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges.
2
MetLife
Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information (Continued)
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
 -  Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to NIGL and NDGL, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ("GMIB Costs"), and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ("Market Value Adjustments");
 -  Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for scheduled periodic settlement payments and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments;
 -  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and value of business acquired ("VOBA") excludes amounts related to: (i) NIGL and NDGL, (ii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs, and (iii) Market Value Adjustments;
 -  Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market Value Adjustments;
 -  Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and
 -  Other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements, and (iii) acquisition and integration costs.
Operating return on MetLife, Inc. common equity is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common equity.
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity and operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity and return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, respectively.

Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information (Continued)
For the historical periods presented, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this Appendix to the presentation materials and are on the Investor Relations portion of our Internet website. Additional information about our historical results is also available on our Internet website in our Quarterly Financial Supplements for the corresponding periods.
The non-GAAP measures used in this presentation should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
In these presentations, we sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.
In these presentations, we provide guidance on our future earnings, premiums, fees and other revenues, and return on common equity on an operating or non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or without the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

As CIO, Kandarian oversaw the company's more than $450 billion general account portfolio and led a number of initiatives that strengthened the portfolio and contributed to MetLife's bottom line.

From 2001 to 2004, Kandarian was executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). During his tenure, he made the public case for comprehensive reform of the pension funding rules to put the defined benefit system and the PBGC on a sound financial footing, helping to lay the groundwork for the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures
All references in this press release (except in this section) to operating earnings and return on equity should be read as operating earnings available to common shareholders and operating return on MetLife, Inc.'s common equity, excluding AOCI, respectively.
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife ("Divested businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
 
 
 
The following additional adjustments are made to GAAP expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Operating return on MetLife, Inc. common equity is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average GAAP common equity.
MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, and GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, respectively. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included below and/or in the Appendix section of today's presentations for MetLife, Inc.'s Investor Day Conference.
 
In this press release, MetLife has included projections of its future earnings on an operating and non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or without the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
