Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, August 1, 2012  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported second quarter 2012 net income of $2.3 billion, or $2.12 per share, and operating earnings
1
of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share.
"MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter particularly given the current environment," said Steven A. Kandarian, chairman, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Our story is clear  consistent execution on the fundamentals of the business. Our underwriting discipline is paying off, our investment income and core spreads are healthy, and we're successfully managing through the low-interest-rate environment."
Net income included net derivative gains of $1.4 billion, after tax, largely due to decreases in interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads during the quarter. As part of its broader asset-liability management strategy, MetLife uses derivatives to hedge certain risks, such as movements in interest rates and foreign currencies. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Also, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.
 
 
 
SUMMARY
 
 
 
 
 
 
BUSINESS DISCUSSIONS
All comparisons of second quarter 2012 results in the business discussions that follow are with the second quarter of 2011, unless otherwise noted. All comparisons on a constant currency basis are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and are applied to the prior period. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Second Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
THE AMERICAS
Total operating earnings for the Americas increased 11% to $1.1 billion driven by strong earnings growth in Retail as well as Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits. Premiums, fees & other revenues for the Americas were down slightly at $8.4 billion, largely due to a decline in pension closeout sales, which often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
Retail
Operating earnings for Retail  which includes U.S. retail life insurance and annuities  were $380 million, up 14% due to favorable investment margins, higher fees and lower expenses. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retail were $2.4 billion, up 3% as higher annuity fees were partially offset by lower income annuity and life sales. Variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion, down 34%.
 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits
Operating earnings for Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits  which includes U.S. group life, non-medical health and property & casualty insurance  were $295 million, up 29% mainly due to favorable claims experience in the non-medical health business and lower catastrophes in the property & casualty business. While catastrophes were lower compared with the record levels in the second quarter of 2011, they were $44 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax, above the company's quarterly plan provision for the second quarter of 2012. These higher than expected catastrophes were partially offset by favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years of $25 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax, in the second quarter of 2012.
Premiums, fees & other revenues for Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were $4.5 billion, up 4% due to growth across the businesses, including favorable sales and persistency in group life as well as higher dental, disability and property & casualty revenues.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding  which includes the U.S. and U.K. pension closeout businesses, structured settlements and other benefit funding products  were $318 million, down 2%. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding were $645 million, down 35% due to lower pension closeout sales (which often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter) and a decline in structured settlement sales.
Latin America
Operating earnings for Latin America were $135 million, up 5% (19% on a constant currency basis) due to business growth in several countries. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Latin America increased 1% (13% on a constant currency basis) to $851 million, largely due to growth in accident & health insurance in Chile and Argentina as well as higher immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total sales for the region increased 4%, driven by growth in the accident & health and retirement businesses.
ASIA
Operating earnings for Asia were $275 million, up 61% primarily due to growth in the business in Japan and strong net investment income. The prior year period was negatively impacted by the March 2011 tsunami and earthquake in Japan. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% due to business growth in Japan and Australia as well as improved persistency in both Japan and Korea. Total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by higher life sales in Japan, increased accident & health sales in China and growth in group sales in Australia.
EMEA
Operating earnings for EMEA were $82 million, up 28% (46% on a constant currency basis) due to business growth in several countries and the benefit of a one-time item. EMEA premiums, fees & other revenues were $815 million, down 4%, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Total sales for the region increased 13% despite the challenging economic environment in Europe. Turkey, Russia and the Gulf countries contributed to the sales growth in the quarter.
 
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $5.2 billion, up 4%. Variable investment income was above the plan range at $371 million ($242 million, after tax and DAC) compared with $273 million ($177 million, after tax and DAC) in the second quarter of 2011.
For the second quarter of 2012, MetLife reported $4 million, after tax, of investment portfolio net gains compared with investment portfolio net losses of $34 million, after tax. Derivative net gains were $1.3 billion, after tax and other adjustments, compared with derivative net gains of $195 million, after tax and other adjustments, in the second quarter of 2011.
CORPORATE & OTHER
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $59 million, compared with an operating loss of $43 million. Higher net investment income in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by lower earnings from MetLife Bank's forward mortgage servicing operations and certain other expenses of $29 million ($0.03 per share), after tax.

Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife ("Divested businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL").

MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common
 
shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Second Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement and/or in the tables that accompany this earnings press release.

Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
