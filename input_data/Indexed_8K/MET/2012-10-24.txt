Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
As announced in November 2011, MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife") reorganized its business from a U.S. Business and International structure into three broad geographic regions to better reflect its global reach. As a result, in the first quarter of 2012, MetLife reorganized into six segments, reflecting these broad geographic regions: Retail; Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, "The Americas"); Asia; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). As anticipated, in the third quarter of 2012, MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife") continued to realign certain products and businesses among its existing segments to better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business (the "Realignment"). The changes made in the Realignment are as follows:
 
 
Group
 
 
 
Voluntary & Worksite
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also in the third quarter of 2012, MetLife began exploring the sale of MetLife Bank, National Association's forward mortgage servicing assets and operations and, therefore, began reporting this business as divested.
To aid investors' understanding of the impact of the items described above, MetLife has revised the information presented in its Quarterly Financial Supplement for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011 and attached such revised historical financial results (the "Historical Results Financial Supplement") to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
The Historical Results Financial Supplement attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is furnished and not filed pursuant to instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information described under "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 7.01. The Historical Results Financial Supplement attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K is furnished and not filed pursuant to instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.
