Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, October 31, 2012  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported the following results for the third quarter of 2012:
MetLife reported operating earnings* of $1.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. The Americas segment reported an increase in operating earnings of 58%, partly due to several items that negatively impacted third quarter 2011 results, and the Asia segment reported a 17% increase. Reported operating earnings for the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segment were down 5%, but up 20% when adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
On a GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million, or $0.92 per share, including a $1.6 billion, after tax, goodwill impairment, which reflects the impact of current market and economic conditions on the estimated fair value of the U.S. retail annuity business. Also included in the net loss were net derivative losses of $467 million, after tax, which reflect MetLife's use of derivatives (as part of its broader asset-liability management strategy) to hedge certain risks, such as movements in interest rates and foreign currencies. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment.
Premiums, fees & other revenues* were $11.6 billion, down 1% from the third quarter of 2011. Excluding pension closeout sales (which often fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter) and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, total premiums, fees & other revenues grew 2%.
Net investment income* was $5.0 billion, up 2% over the third quarter of 2011 and reflecting variable investment income above the plan range by $3 million, after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs ("DAC").
Book value, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), was $47.70 per share, up 3% over the third quarter of 2011.
"Our continued solid operating earnings reflect the strength of our diverse, global business," said Steven A. Kandarian, chairman, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "Our focus on pricing discipline and risk management continues to serve us well in this challenging economic environment. As we continue to execute on our strategy, we will strengthen MetLife's ability to deliver value for its customers and shareholders."
THIRD QUARTER SUMMARY
 
 
BUSINESS DISCUSSIONS
In the third quarter of 2012, MetLife continued to realign certain products and businesses among its existing segments to better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business. Several products were reorganized among the Retail and Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits businesses in the Americas. The company also began reporting the results of South Asia and India, which were previously reported in the EMEA segment, in the Asia segment. In addition, MetLife began reporting MetLife Bank's forward mortgage servicing assets and operations as divested businesses. Certain amounts in prior periods have been revised. Further details on these changes can be found in the Third Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement.
All comparisons of third quarter 2012 results in the business discussions that follow are with the third quarter of 2011, unless otherwise noted. All comparisons on a constant currency basis are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and are applied to the prior period. Reconciliations of segment net income to segment operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release and in the Third Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement, which is available on the Investor Relations section of www.metlife.com.
THE AMERICAS
Total operating earnings for the Americas increased 58% to $1.2 billion, driven by Retail and Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits. Third quarter 2011 results were negatively impacted by a reserve increase for potential unreported life insurance claims and higher catastrophes. Third quarter 2012 results benefitted from catastrophes that were $26 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax, lower than the company's quarterly plan provision and $10 million, or $0.01 per share, after tax, of favorable non-catastrophe claim development related to prior accident years.
Premiums, fees & other revenues for the Americas were down 2% to $8.3 billion, as growth in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits was offset by a decline in Corporate Benefit Funding.
 
Retail
Operating earnings for Retail more than doubled to $492 million due to higher net investment income, an increase in fees, lower catastrophes and expenses, and the above mentioned reserve increase in the prior year period. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Retail were $3.0 billion, down 1% as an increase in fees was more than offset by lower income annuity sales. Variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion, down 46%.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits
Operating earnings for Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were $283 million, up 85% mostly due to the previously mentioned reserve increase in the prior year period as well as lower catastrophes and favorable non-catastrophe claim experience. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were $4.0 billion, up 9% due to favorable sales and persistency across the business, particularly in dental.
Corporate Benefit Funding
Operating earnings for Corporate Benefit Funding were $303 million, up 11% mostly due to strong interest margins and lower expenses. Premiums, fees & other revenues for Corporate Benefit Funding were $567 million, down 41% due to a decline in structured settlement sales as well as lower pension closeout sales.
Latin America
Operating earnings for Latin America were $152 million, up 8% (15% on a constant currency basis) due to business growth in several countries and a one-time tax-related benefit. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Latin America were $802 million, down 8%. On a constant currency basis, premiums, fees & other revenues were down 1% as growth in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina was offset by a decline in Chile. Total sales for the region increased 28%, driven by growth in all channels across the region.
ASIA
Operating earnings for Asia were $259 million, up 17% primarily due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income. Premiums, fees & other revenues in Asia were $2.5 billion, up 7% mostly due to increased sales and persistency in Japan and higher revenues in Korea. Total sales for the region declined 8% as higher life sales in Japan and an increase in direct marketing sales in China were more than offset by declines in several other countries, including Australia, which benefitted from a large group sale in the prior year period.
EMEA
Operating earnings for EMEA were $62 million, down 5% due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, EMEA operating earnings were up 20%, driven by Turkey and Russia. EMEA premiums, fees & other revenues were $653 million, down 10% (1% on a constant currency basis). Total sales for the region increased 15% due to growth in Turkey and Russia and despite the challenging economic environment in Western Europe.
 
INVESTMENTS
Net investment income was $5.0 billion, up 2%. Variable investment income was above the plan range at $260 million ($165 million, after tax and DAC) compared with $260 million ($169 million, after tax) in the third quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2012, investment portfolio net gains were $43 million, after tax, compared with investment portfolio net gains of $9 million, after tax in the third quarter of 2011. The impact of MetLife's credit spreads and increases in interest rates during the quarter drove derivative net losses of $543 million, after tax and other adjustments, compared with derivative net gains of $2.8 billion, after tax and other adjustments, in the third quarter of 2011. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.
CORPORATE & OTHER
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $134 million, compared with an operating loss of $102 million. Results in the third quarter of 2012 reflect certain reorganization costs of $35 million, or $0.03 per share, after tax.

Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss that MetLife uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is MetLife's measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which MetLife senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans.
Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife ("Divested businesses"). Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) ("NIGL") and net derivative gains (losses) ("NDGL"). Operating expenses also exclude goodwill impairments.

MetLife believes the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as MetLife measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating revenues, operating expenses, operating earnings, operating earnings available to common shareholders, operating earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI, should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: GAAP revenues, GAAP expenses, GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders, GAAP net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders per diluted common share, book value per common share and book value per diluted common share, respectively. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Third Quarter 2012 Financial Supplement and/or in the tables that accompany this earnings press release.
Statistical sales information for life insurance is calculated by MetLife using the LIMRA International, Inc. definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Individual annuities sales consists of statutory premiums direct and assumed, excluding company sponsored internal exchanges.
