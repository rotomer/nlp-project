Overview
On February 19, 2009, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "BMS Compensation Committee") of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS") approved 2008 annual incentive award payouts under the BMS Performance Incentive Plan and certified payouts to be made under the BMS Long-Term Performance Award Program based on performance during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, for each of the Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (the "Company") executive officers named in the compensation-related tables for 2008 (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers") set forth in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-156298), as amended, at the time it became effective on February 10, 2009 (the "Registration Statement"), and the related final prospectus (the "Prospectus") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2009. Such tables did not reflect payout levels based on 2008 performance under the BMS Performance Incentive Plan and the BMS Long-Term Performance Award Program because, at the time the Registration Statement became effective (such time, the "Effective Time"), certain 2008 performance results had not yet been determined or the results had not yet been certified by the BMS Compensation Committee. Furthermore, the tables in the Registration Statement and Prospectus did not include the amounts of any other payments that are calculated, in whole or in part, based on 2008 payout levels under the BMS Performance Incentive Plan or the BMS Long-Term Performance Award Program.
The following is a description of the information relating to 2008 compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers that was not available at the Effective Time:
BMS 2008 Annual Incentive Awards
Payout levels pursuant to the 2008 annual incentive awards for the Company's Named Executive Officers under the BMS Performance Incentive Plan were not included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus for two reasons. First, BMS's 2008 net operating cash flow, which was one of the performance metrics used in determining a portion of the 2008 annual incentive awards, had not been determined as of the Effective Time. Actual net operating cash flow for 2008 has now been determined to be $3.852 billion, or 115.6% of $3.333 billion, which was the target performance goal with respect to the 2008 annual incentive awards. Second, individual payout levels were determined based on an assessment of individual performance pursuant to a process that was not complete until February 19, 2008, when the BMS Compensation Committee approved the payouts. The amounts of these payouts are set forth in the table below entitled "Summary Compensation Table".
BMS Long-Term Performance Awards
Payout levels for 2008 under the BMS Long-Term Performance Award Program for the 2006-2008, 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 performance periods were not included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus for two reasons. First, 2008 net operating cash flow was the performance metric used to determine 50% of the 2008 payout of the 2008-2010 special award and, as noted above, the results had not been determined as of the Effective Time. Second, the BMS Compensation Committee must certify payout levels pursuant to these awards and, notwithstanding achievement of the relevant performance goals, is permitted to apply negative discretion to reduce or eliminate payments. This certification did not take place until February 19, 2009.
 
The following is a summary of payout levels under the 2006-2008, 2007-2009, 2008-2010 regular and 2008-2010 special long-term performance awards held by our Named Executive Officers, based on achievement of performance results and certification by the BMS Compensation Committee:
2006-2008 Long-Term Performance Award*
 
 
2007-2009 Long-Term Performance Award*
 
 
2008-2010 Regular Long-Term Performance Award*
 
 
2008-2010 Special Long-Term Performance Award*
 
 
The actual number of shares of BMS common stock that each of the Company's Named Executive Officers became entitled to receive pursuant to the 2006-2008 award is set forth in the table below entitled "Option Exercises and Stock Vesting". The actual number of shares of BMS common stock that each of the Company's Named Executive Officers will become entitled to receive as a result of 2008 performance pursuant to each of the 2007-2009 award, the 2008-2010 regular award and the 2008-2010 special award (provided they remain employed by the Company through the relevant vesting date) is set forth in the table below entitled "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End".
 
Updates to Tables from the Registration Statement and Prospectus
The tables set forth below, or portions thereof, were included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, but they have been updated to include information that was not calculable as of the Effective Time. New numbers have been indicated by
bold italics.
 
 
 
 
As described above, the BMS Compensation Committee has certified 2008 payouts of awards under the BMS Long-Term Performance Award Program. Below are the relevant sections of the table from the Registration Statement and Prospectus entitled "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" that were affected by such certification. Due to the length and complexity of this table in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, amounts from this table that did not change from the Registration Statement and Prospectus have not been included below.
 
 
 
 
 
The information in the table below was not included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, because the amount of 2008 annual incentive award payouts under the BMS Performance Incentive Plan had not yet been determined, and that information was necessary in order to calculate the value, as of December 31, 2008, of accumulated benefits under the BMS Retirement Income Plan, the BMS Benefit Equalization Plan, the BMS Key International Pension Plan and the United Kingdom Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Pension Plan.
 
 
 
 
 
 
These assumptions are the same as those disclosed in BMS's annual Form 10-K filing in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The actual benefit received will vary based on a number of factors including final pay, years of service and interest rates at the time of retirement. No pension payments were made to any Named Executive Officer under these plans in 2008.
 
The information in in the table below was not included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, because the amount of 2008 annual incentive award payouts under the BMS Performance Incentive Plan and the payout levels for 2008 under the 2007-2009 award, 2008-2010 regular award and 2008-2010 special award under the BMS Long-Term Performance Award Program had not yet been determined, and that information was necessary in order to calculate the values in below.
