Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Reports Solid Full-Year Results;
Forecasts Stronger Sales Growth in 2010;
Provides Initial EPS Guidance
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 28, 2010--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2009, including:
GAAP net earnings of $1.99 per diluted share for 2009, compared with $2.32 per diluted share for 2008.
Non-GAAPnet earnings for 2009 of $2.23 per diluted share, up from $1.90 per diluted share a year earlier.
(1)
GAAP net earnings of $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with $0.27 per diluted share for the year-ago fourth quarter.
Non-GAAPnet earnings of $0.48 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, up from $0.36 per diluted share last year. Gains were driven by strong contributions from emerging markets, lower commodity costs and a reduced tax rate, partially offset by significantly higher demand-generation investments.
GAAP sales up 1 percent quarter-over-quarter; non-GAAP sales up 2.5 percent. Reported non-GAAP sales growth of 15 percent in Asia and Latin America was offset by distributor inventory adjustments in Europe and market contraction in the United States.
Initial full-year 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $2.30 to $2.40; GAAP EPS guidance of $2.07 to $2.17.
(1)
Mead Johnson, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), completed its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2009.
Results for 2008 and 2009 have been adjusted for the factors affecting comparability due to the IPO, the subsequent split-off from BMS and other specified items and are, therefore, adjusted non-GAAP (non-GAAP) financial measures.
See Factors Affecting Comparability  Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
In addition to delivering another quarter of solid financial results, the fourth quarter also marked two further milestones for Mead Johnson, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. Most notable was the final split-off from Bristol-Myers Squibb, making Mead Johnson a fully independent public company. Following completion of a successful exchange offer in December, all shares of Mead Johnson previously owned by BMS are now in the hands of public investors and trading on the New York Stock Exchange. With a market capitalization exceeding $9 billion, we are proud that Mead Johnson became one of the newest additions to the Standard and Poors 500 Index. During the fourth quarter, we also issued $1.5 billion of notes to take advantage of the low interest-rate environment, which will result in significant interest expense savings as we move into 2010. Proceeds from the offering, along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand, were used to repay all of the approximately $1.7 billion of debt previously held by BMS. During the quarter, we began paying down borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and subsequent to year end, we repaid the remaining $120 million balance, further deleveraging our balance sheet.
Once again, our solid financial performance reflects the success of our global growth strategies, Golsby continued. We continued to deliver double-digit growth in Asia and Latin America and further increased our investments to accelerate expansion of our distribution footprint in China. In the United States, we are beginning to see a pattern of market share gains as infants who are on our flagship routine formula, Enfamil Premium, move into their higher consumption months. We significantly increased advertising and promotion spending in the fourth quarter, in part to support our efforts to communicate Enfamil Premiums clinically proven Triple Health Guard benefits of brain and eye development, immunity and growth. While our decision to increase investments in demand creation impacted our earnings growth in the quarter, we did so to build momentum exiting the year, and we are confident in delivering stronger revenue growth in 2010.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $714.4 million, up 1 percent from $707.7 million a year-ago. Sales benefited from price and foreign exchange, largely offset by a drop in volume. The volume decline was driven by planned reductions of distributor inventories in Europe and market contraction due to a reduced birth rate in the United States. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) totaled $113.0 million, down from $134.9 million a year earlier. The decline was primarily due to $54.2 million of costs associated with the IPO, the split-off transaction, separation from BMSs IT systems, litigation expense and other specified costs. EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2008 included $30.8 million of specified costs, largely for work completed in preparation for the IPO. EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2009 was also affected by increased investments in advertising and promotion, and other demand-generation spending, which offset the benefit from lower commodity costs.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $64.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $46.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share for the prior-year period. Results for 2009 benefited from lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate compared with the year-ago fourth quarter, offset by the increase in the number of shares outstanding.
On a non-GAAP basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $99.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with net earnings attributable to shareholders of $74.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $425.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, up 12 percent from $378.2 million in 2008. EBIT totaled $138.5 million, up 34 percent compared with $103.5 million for the year-ago fourth quarter. Segment sales performance was driven by double-digit sales growth, notably in China, Thailand, Malaysia and Peru. EBIT benefited from lower commodity costs, partially offset by higher demand-generation investments in advertising and promotion and sales force additions, primarily in China. Non-GAAP sales for the segment increased 15 percent in the quarter to $425.4 million.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $289.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, down from $329.5 million in 2008. EBIT totaled $81.3 million, compared with $109.7 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. This segments results reflect the impact of planned reductions in distributor inventories held by BMS in Europe, the significant contraction of the infant formula market in the United States due to lower births, and lower market share in the United States versus the fourth quarter a year ago. EBIT benefited from lower commodity costs, offset by higher advertising and promotional spending in support of new products. Non-GAAP segment sales decreased 12 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $289.0 million, compared with the year-ago fourth quarter; however, sales increased 1 percent on a sequential quarter basis.
Full-Year 2009 Results
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2009, net sales totaled $2,826.5 million, down 2 percent from $2,882.4 million for 2008. Sales benefited from price, which was more than offset by foreign exchange and lower volume. EBIT decreased to $679.6 million, down from $695.7 million a year earlier. EBIT in 2009 was reduced by a net $81.1 million of costs associated with the IPO, the split-off transaction, separation from BMSs IT systems and other specified costs. EBIT in 2008 included $44.8 million of costs primarily related to the IPO. Other factors affecting EBIT in 2009 include the benefit of lower commodity costs and productivity savings, offset by higher demand-generation spending and costs incurred as a public company.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for 2009 totaled $399.6 million, up slightly from $393.9 million in 2008. While 2009 was adversely affected by $49.3 million in higher interest expense and higher specified costs, this was more than offset by the benefit of a lower effective tax rate and improved operating performance compared with 2008. Earnings per diluted share for 2009 were $1.99, compared with $2.32 in 2008. The greater number of shares outstanding in 2009 following the February IPO reduced earnings on a per share basis. There were approximately 200.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding in 2009, compared with 170.0 million shares in 2008.
On a non-GAAP basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $456.3 million, or $2.23 per diluted share, in 2009, compared with net earnings attributable to shareholders of $389.3 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in 2008.
Outlook for 2010
Despite headwinds from higher commodity costs and the overlap in infrastructure costs, we are confident of producing another year of earnings growth, Golsby said. We are mindful, however, that we operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. We are initiating 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, up from $2.23 per share in 2009.
Key assumptions underlying this non-GAAP estimate include a net sales increase of at least 7 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange; higher raw material and commodity costs, primarily dairy; approximately $25 million in incremental infrastructure costs incurred during the transition from BMS as a shared services provider to IBM; ongoing investments in demand-creation activities and expansion in new markets; an effective tax rate between 30 and 31 percent; and 205 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
The non-GAAP earnings guidance excludes approximately $0.23 per diluted share of costs primarily associated with the separation from BMSs IT systems. Therefore, 2010 GAAP earnings are estimated at $2.07 to $2.17 per diluted share, compared with $1.99 per diluted share in 2009.

Factors Affecting Comparability  Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release contains adjusted non-GAAP (non-GAAP) financial measures, including non-GAAP net sales, EBIT, earnings and earnings per share information, adjusted for factors that affect comparability due to the impact of the companys IPO, the split-off from BMS and other specified costs. The items included in GAAP measures, but excluded for the purpose of determining non-GAAP net sales, EBIT, earnings and earnings per share, are the impact of operating model adjustments and specified IPO, split-off and other costs. In addition, other adjusted items include interest expense due to changes in the capital structure, the effective tax rate (ETR) due to the impact of specified IPO and other costs on the tax rate, and the number of shares outstanding to reflect the increase in shares due to the IPO. Non-GAAP net sales, EBIT, earnings and earnings per share information adjusting for these items is an indication of the companys underlying operating results and intended to enhance an investors overall understanding of the companys financial performance. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators the company uses as a basis for evaluating company performance, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Operating Model Adjustments for 2008
In Brazil, the companys ability to operate a new stand-alone subsidiary was delayed until late in the third quarter of 2009. Prior to that time, BMS distributed and recorded sales for Mead Johnson products. Mead Johnson conducted marketing activities and recorded service revenue equal to the companys marketing costs plus a markup. In Europe, the company will transition from using BMS to distribute products to a third-party distributor model. This will reduce net sales by the amount of the distributors margin and lower costs for distribution-related expenses that historically have been recorded in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. In Mexico, the companys business will be operated through a newly formed operating subsidiary that is expected to incur higher profit sharing costs than were allocated to Mead Johnson when it was operated within a BMS legal entity.
(2) Specified IPO, Split-Off and Other Costs
Earnings before interest and income taxes include the following costs (in millions):
(3) Interest Expense
The company had interest expense of $17.3 million and $92.6 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009, respectively. The company had interest expense of $31.4 million and $43.3 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2008, respectively.
(4) Effective Tax Rate
The companys ETR has been adjusted for the non-deductibility of certain IPO and split-off costs.
(5) Shares Outstanding
Prior to Feb. 10, 2009, there were 170.0 million shares of common stock outstanding. The company issued an additional 34.5 million shares of common stock in the IPO.
