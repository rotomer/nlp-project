Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Delivers Strong First Quarter Results;
Narrows Full-Year Guidance
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 2010--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, including:
Net sales in the quarter were up 10 percent versus the first quarter of 2009 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 7 percent.
GAAP net earnings of $0.61 per diluted share for first quarter of 2010, compared with $0.55 per diluted share for 2009.
Non-GAAP net earnings of $0.65 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010, up 14 percent from $0.57 per diluted share a year earlier.
(1)
First quarter 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings include a $0.05 per diluted share unfavorable impact from the January devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.
Earnings growth was driven by strong contributions from emerging markets, stable performance from developed markets, lower interest expense and a slightly reduced tax rate, partially offset by significantly higher demand-generation investments and higher operating expenses incurred as a stand- alone company.
Narrowing full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $2.33 to $2.40; previously $2.30 to $2.40. GAAP EPS guidance of $2.10 to $2.17.

See Factors Affecting Comparability  Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. With emerging markets continuing to produce double-digit sales and earnings growth, and the improvements in the performance of our U.S. business, we are on track to report another year of profitable growth. While our China business continues to be the largest contributor to our revenue growth, it was just one of 10 major markets in Asia and Latin America to report double-digit gains, demonstrating the broad-based success of our growth strategy. Our results also reflect many actions taken to strengthen performance in the United States, including the introduction of several new products, resulting in improved market share.
We ended the quarter with $462 million of cash, after paying off $120 million of debt, Mr. Golsby added. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue new opportunities to invest for future growth. For example, our strategy to expand our global reach within high-growth regions continued in the first quarter with the announcement of our agreement to form a joint venture with Almarai Company to manufacture, market and distribute pediatric nutrition products in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries of the Middle East.
First Quarter Results
Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $763.5 million, up 10 percent from $693.0 million a year-ago. Sales benefited 4 percent from volume and 3 percent each from price and foreign exchange. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) totaled $197.9 million, up from $188.8 million a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by increased advertising and promotion spending, higher research and development expense, the adverse impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and additional costs to support the infrastructure required for a stand-alone public company.
EBIT for the first quarter of 2010 includes $10.9 million of specified expenses primarily associated with costs to separate from Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMS) IT platform. EBIT for the first quarter of 2009 included $14.8 million of net specified items, largely for costs related to the companys initial public offering in February 2009, net of a favorable legal settlement.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $125.6 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared with $103.5 million, or $0.55 per diluted share for the prior-year period. Results for 2010 benefited from significantly lower interest expense as a result of the debt refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, which lowered the amount of debt outstanding as well as the interest rates, along with a slightly lower effective tax rate compared with the year-ago first quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the specified items noted above, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $133.8 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $115.8 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
First Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $456.0 million for the first quarter of 2010, up 17 percent from $389.8 million in 2009. Sales benefited 7 percent from volume, 6 percent from price and 4 percent from foreign exchange. Segment performance was driven by constant dollar double-digit sales growth, notably in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and several Latin American countries. EBIT totaled $166.3 million, up 12 percent compared with $148.7 million for the year-ago first quarter. EBIT was affected in the quarter by higher demand-generation investments in advertising and promotion and sales force additions in support of our geographic expansion efforts, primarily in China.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $307.5 million for the first quarter of 2010, up from $303.2 million in 2009. Sales benefited 2 percent from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 1 percent decline in volume with no contribution from price. EBIT totaled $97.1 million, including the impact of higher advertising and promotional spending, compared with $101.2 million in the first quarter a year ago.
Outlook for 2010
Looking at the rest of the year, we expect continued strong growth in Asia/Latin America, while the market in the United States remains challenging, particularly given a lower birth rate. We are encouraged, however, by greater strength in our U.S. market share, evidence of the success of our recent product innovations and our demand-creation programs. Nevertheless, we still expect sales for our North America/Europe segment to be relatively flat compared with 2009 for the full year, Mr. Golsby said. While we experienced lower dairy costs in the first quarter, this trend will start to reverse in the second quarter as the impact of the rise in dairy prices during the latter half of 2009 begins to flow through our financials. Further, we are planning for significantly higher demand-generation investments in the remainder of the year to sustain accelerated growth, as well as a ramp up in our shared service cost overlap as we transition to IBM from BMS as our shared service provider. Given the continued strength in our Asia/Latin America segment and stabilization in North America and Europe, we are narrowing our 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $2.33 to $2.40.
Key assumptions underlying this non-GAAP estimate include a net sales increase of 7 to 8 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange; gross margin contraction due to higher manufacturing, raw material and commodity costs, primarily dairy; up to $25 million in incremental infrastructure costs incurred during the shared service transition to IBM; ongoing investments in demand-creation activities and expansion into new markets; an effective tax rate between 30 and 31 percent; and 205 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
GAAP earnings guidance is estimated at $2.10 to $2.17 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $1.99 per diluted share in 2009. GAAP guidance includes approximately $0.23 per share of specified items, consisting primarily of costs to separate from BMSs IT systems.

In addition, other adjusted items include the tax impact of specified IPO, split-off and other costs, and the number of shares outstanding in 2009 to reflect the increase in shares due to the IPO. Non-GAAP EBIT, earnings and earnings per share information adjusting for these items is an indication of the companys underlying operating results and intended to enhance an investors overall understanding of the companys financial performance. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators the company uses as a basis for evaluating company performance, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods.
