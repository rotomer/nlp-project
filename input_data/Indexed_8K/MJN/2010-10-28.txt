Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Reports Strong Third Quarter Results;
Constant Dollar Sales up 15 Percent
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 28, 2010--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010.
Net sales in the quarter were up 16 percent, including foreign exchange, primarily driven by 12 percent volume growth.
GAAP net earnings of $0.52 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010 were up from $0.48 per diluted share a year ago.
Non-GAAP net earnings for the third quarter increased 8 percent to $0.57 per diluted share from $0.53 per diluted share a year earlier.
(1)
Sales and earnings benefited from double-digit sales growth in all regions. Earnings also benefited from lower interest expense, offset by increased commodity and manufacturing costs, higher demand-generation investments, costs incurred as a stand-alone company and a higher effective tax rate versus the year-ago quarter.
Raising full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.38 to $2.42 from $2.35 to $2.40. Including specified items estimated at $0.23 per share, GAAP EPS guidance is $2.15 to $2.19.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
All regions contributed to our strong performance in the quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. Results for the U.S. business reflect further share gains, but also a favorable comparison with the third quarter of 2009 when retailers were reducing inventories to normal levels following the inventory build from the second quarter launch of Enfamil Premium. We also started to reduce inventories in Europe last year from the high levels carried by Bristol-Myers Squibb, our regional distributor. Adjusting for the changes in inventories, sales for the North America/Europe segment increased in the low-single digits bringing year-to-date sales even with the prior year. We continue to experience double-digit sales growth in most of our major Asia and Latin America markets with China, Hong Kong and Brazil growing in excess of the 16 percent constant dollar sales gain for the segment. We are benefiting from overall market growth, as well as increases in share from new product innovations and our investments.
Looking at the full year, we are projecting slightly higher sales growth than was assumed in our previous guidance. Global sales for the year are projected to be up 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent, excluding foreign exchange. We are further increasing demand generation spending in the fourth quarter to strengthen momentum heading into 2011, as well as assuming a higher effective tax rate. This is on top of a significant ramp up of costs in the quarter associated with our transition to a new shared service provider and investments in our stand-alone public company infrastructure. Nevertheless, our non-GAAP earnings estimate for the full year has been raised to $2.38 to $2.42 per share, Mr. Golsby noted.
Third Quarter Results
Net sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010, totaled $810.2 million, up 16 percent from $699.8 million a year ago. Sales benefited 12 percent from volume, 3 percent from price and 1 percent from foreign exchange. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) for the third quarter totaled $165.5 million, up from $159.7 million a year earlier. Net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $106.1 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $97.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for the prior-year quarter.
The increase in EBIT in the third quarter of 2010 was driven by higher sales, partially offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs, increased demand creation spending, a non-cash pension settlement, costs related to building a stand-alone company infrastructure and $19.3 million of specified costs, primarily related to the separation from Bristol-Myers Squibbs IT platform. The third quarter of 2010 also benefited from significantly lower interest expense as a result of the debt refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, partially offset by higher taxes. Results for the third quarter of 2009 included $15.9 million of specified costs.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $117.8 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $107.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
Third Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $489.7 million for the third quarter of 2010, up 18 percent from $413.8 million in 2009. Sales benefited 11 percent from volume, 5 percent from price and 2 percent from foreign exchange. EBIT totaled $168.0 million, up 17 percent compared with $143.7 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase in EBIT was due to strong sales primarily due to market growth and share gains driven by higher demand-generation investments in advertising and promotion and sales force additions in support of strategic growth initiatives, primarily in China and other selected emerging markets.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $320.5 million for the third quarter of 2010, up 12 percent from $286.0 million in 2009. Sales benefited 13 percent from volume, offset by a 1 percent reduction from foreign exchange. The increase in sales was primarily due to the timing of changes in customer inventories. The companys launch of Enfamil Premium in the United States led to a retail inventory build in the second quarter of 2009, which reversed in the third quarter as retailers adjusted inventories to more normal levels. In the third quarter of 2009, Mead Johnson began reducing inventories in Europe from the high levels carried by Bristol-Myers Squibb, its regional distributor. Excluding the inventory changes, sales in the third quarter of 2010 increased in the low-single digits. Sales in the United States benefited from market share gains from new product introductions, partially offset by a market contraction primarily due to a lower birth rate. Sales benefited marginally from increased demand when a competitor commenced a recall of certain infant formula products in the United States in the last days of the quarter. EBIT totaled $97.4 million, compared with $90.3 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase was principally the result of higher sales, partially offset by increased commodity and manufacturing costs.
Nine-Month Results
Net sales for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2010, totaled $2,337.9 million, up 11 percent from $2,112.1 million a year ago. Sales benefited 5 percent from volume, 4 percent from price, and 2 percent from foreign exchange. EBIT for the first three quarters of 2010 totaled $536.3 million, down from $566.6 million a year earlier. Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the first nine months of 2010 totaled $353.1 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, compared with $335.6 million, or $1.68 per diluted share for the prior-year period.
The first three quarters of 2010 benefited from lower interest expense and taxes, which were offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs, demand creation investments, including advertising and promotion and sales force additions, stand-alone company costs, and $43.3 million of specified items primarily for IT separation costs. Results for 2009 include $48.8 million of specified items primarily for costs associated with the companys IPO and IT separation projects, partially offset by a $10.0 million gain from a patent settlement in the first quarter and an $11.9 million gain on an asset sale in the second quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $381.7 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for the first three quarters of 2010, compared with $356.9 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.
Nine-Month Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $1,417.4 million for the first three quarters of 2010, up 18 percent from $1,200.1 million in 2009. Sales benefited 9 percent from volume, 6 percent from price and 3 percent from foreign exchange. Segment EBIT totaled $492.0 million, up 12 percent compared with $438.5 million for the year-ago period. The increase in sales came from market growth and share gains driven by increased investments in advertising and promotion and sales force in support of strategic growth initiatives. Double-digit constant-dollar sales growth was reported in the majority of the companys largest markets.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $920.5 million for the first three quarters of 2010, up from $912.0 million in 2009. Sales benefited 1 percent from price and 1 percent from foreign exchange, offset by a 1 percent decline in volume. EBIT totaled $272.7 million, compared with $310.5 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin driven by higher commodity and manufacturing costs, and increased advertising and promotion spending.
