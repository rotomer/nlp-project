Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Reports Strong Second Quarter and First Half Results; Second Quarter Constant Dollar Sales up 18 Percent; Raises Full-Year Guidance
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 28, 2011--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Net sales in the quarter were up 22 percent versus the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 18 percent.
GAAP net earnings of $0.64 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011 increased from $0.59 per diluted share in 2010.
Non-GAAP net earnings of $0.72 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011 were up from $0.63 per diluted share a year earlier.
(1)
Reported sales growth for the quarter was driven by excellent performance from both Asia/Latin America (+30 percent) and North America/Europe (+10 percent), largely from volume growth in both segments.
Earnings benefited from strong sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher demand-generation investments and other operating expenses, along with a higher effective tax rate versus the year-ago quarter.
Full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range increased to $2.70 to $2.75 from $2.62 to $2.70. Including specified items estimated at $0.27 per share, GAAP EPS guidance is $2.43 to $2.48.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
We are very pleased with our strong sales and earnings performance in the second quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. Our emerging markets business continued to deliver exceptional growth, led by China/Hong Kong and our markets in Latin America. It is clear that our investments in advertising and promotion, geographic expansion and product innovation are bearing fruit. We also saw significant sales growth in the U.S. driven by market share gains. We will face headwinds in the second half of the year from significantly higher commodity costs and more challenging comparisons with the prior year, but Im pleased with the positive momentum in the business.
Second Quarter Results
Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, totaled $932.0 million, up 22 percent from $764.2 million a year ago. Sales benefited 17 percent from volume, 4 percent from foreign exchange and 1 percent from price. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) for the second quarter totaled $203.7 million, up 18 percent from $172.9 million a year earlier. The EBIT increase was primarily due to higher sales and improved gross margins, partially offset by increased demand-generation investments, stand-alone IT platform implementation costs and accruals for performance-based compensation.
Gross margin was up 120 basis points versus the second quarter of 2010 as productivity, geographic mix and higher volumes more than offset higher commodity costs. Operating expenses increased from higher sales force and distribution expenses, advertising and promotion investments, IT separation costs, performance-based compensation and shared service overlap costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.6 percent versus 24.1 percent a year ago and the increase was mainly attributable to changes in our geographic earnings mix along with the standard quarterly accruals necessary to true up our tax liability to the latest full-year projected tax rate. The 24.1 percent effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was well below the full year actual rate of 27.8 percent.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the second quarter of 2011 totaled $132.1 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with $121.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share for the prior-year period.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $148.7 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $130.1 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
Second Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $611.6 million for the second quarter of 2011, up 30 percent from $471.7 million in 2010. Sales benefited 21 percent from volume, 6 percent from foreign exchange and 3 percent from price. Segment performance was driven by strong growth in China/Hong Kong and in most of the Latin America markets resulting both from market growth and market share strength. EBIT totaled $209.8 million, up 33 percent compared with $157.7 million for the year-ago second quarter. EBIT increased from strong sales and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion investments, sales force expansion, performance-based compensation and new shared service costs.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $320.4 million for the second quarter of 2011, up 10 percent from $292.5 million in 2010. Sales benefited 10 percent from volume and 1 percent from foreign exchange, along with a 1 percent decline in price. Strong sales performance was driven by market share gains in the U.S. from successful product launches in the prior year and the effect of a competitors product recall late in 2010. The U.S. business grew despite the ongoing decline in births. EBIT totaled $86.4 million, up 10 percent compared with $78.2 million in the second quarter a year ago. EBIT increased from strong sales and improved gross margins partially offset by demand-generation investments, performance-based compensation and new shared service costs.
Corporate and Other expenses increased due to higher IT separation costs and foreign exchange impacts.
Six-Month Results
Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2011, totaled $1,831.8 million, up 20 percent from $1,527.7 million a year ago. Sales benefited 14 percent from volume, 3 percent from price and 3 percent from foreign exchange. EBIT for the first half of 2011 totaled $426.3 million, up 15 percent from $370.8 million a year earlier. The EBIT increase was driven by higher sales and improved gross margins, partially offset by increased demand-generation investments, IT separation costs, performance-based compensation and shared service overlap costs.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the first half of 2011 totaled $278.2 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared with $247.0 million, or $1.20 per diluted share for the prior-year period.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $305.5 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the first half of 2011, compared with $263.9 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.
Six-Month Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $1,188.5 million for the first half of 2011, up 28 percent from $927.7 million in 2010. Sales benefited 18 percent from volume, 5 percent from price and 5 percent from foreign exchange. The majority of the markets in the segment had double-digit constant-dollar sales growth driven by overall market growth and share gains from product and packaging innovation. China/Hong Kong posted the highest growth rate in the segment. EBIT for the segment totaled $426.6 million, up 32 percent compared with $324.0 million for the year-ago period. The EBIT increase was primarily related to sales growth and improved gross margin, partially offset by increased demand-generation investments, performance-based compensation and new shared service costs.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $643.3 million for the first half of 2011, up 7 percent compared with $600.0 million in 2010. Sales benefited 7 percent from volume and 1 percent from foreign exchange, offset by a 1 percent decline in price. The segment sales were led by U.S. market share gains from product innovation launched in the prior year and the effect of a competitors product recall late in 2010, partially offset by lower U.S. births. EBIT totaled $179.3 million, up 2 percent compared with $175.3 million in the same period a year ago. EBIT increased from sales growth and improved gross margins, partially offset by increased advertising and promotion investments, distribution and sales force expenses, higher performance-based compensation and new shared service costs.
Corporate and Other expenses increased due to higher IT separation costs and foreign exchange impacts.
Outlook for 2011
For the full year, we anticipate higher sales and earnings growth than our previous guidance, Mr. Golsby said. Based on our strong second quarter performance and positive outlook, annual net sales are estimated to grow by up to 14 percent on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year. With the commodity cost headwinds that well face in the second half of 2011, we expect annual gross margin to be around 63.2 percent of sales. We expect that operating costs will run about 39.7 percent of sales, including additional demand-generation investments to drive future sales growth, as well as higher operating expenses. We expect the effective tax rate will be in the range of 29.0 to 29.5 percent. As a result of all these factors, we are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings estimate to $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
