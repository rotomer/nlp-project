Exhibit 99.1
 
GLENVIEW, Ill., October 13, 2011 
Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) will release preliminary third quarter results today at its Investor Day event. Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby expects "net sales in the quarter of $934 million, up 15 percent versus the third quarter of 2010 on a reported basis, or 11 percent on a constant dollar basis. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.76 - $0.78 per share, driven by strong sales, favorable foreign exchange and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher dairy costs and operating expenses."
 
Additional information to be provided at the Investor Day event includes:
 
     
Reported sales growth for the quarter of 30 percent for the Asia/Latin America segment, or 25 percent on a constant dollar basis.
 
     
A sales decline of 7 percent for the North America/Europe segment, or a 9 percent decline on a constant dollar basis.
 
     
Full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range increased to $2.73 to $2.78 per share, up from prior guidance of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
 
"We are very pleased with our strong sales growth in emerging markets, led by China, Hong Kong and our markets in Latin America," added Mr. Golsby. "These results point to solid execution of our strategies. At our Investor Day event, we will share the next steps we are taking to drive continued growth and success."
