Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Nutrition Reports Strong Sales and Earnings; Third Quarter Constant Dollar Sales Up 11 Percent; Raises Full Year EPS Guidance
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 27, 2011--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011.
Net sales of $933.9 million in the quarter were up 15 percent versus the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 11 percent.
GAAP net earnings of $0.70 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011 increased from $0.52 per diluted share in 2010.
Non-GAAP net earnings of $0.78 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011 were up from $0.57 per diluted share a year earlier.
(1)
Reported sales growth for the quarter was driven by excellent performance from the Asia/Latin America segment (+30 percent). Sales declined for the North America/Europe segment (-7 percent), due in part to a competitors product recall in 2010.
Earnings for the quarter benefited from strong sales, favorable foreign exchange and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher dairy, manufacturing costs and operating expenses.
Full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range increased to $2.73 to $2.78 from $2.70 to $2.75. Including specified items estimated at $0.30 per share, GAAP EPS guidance is $2.43 to $2.48.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
We continue to see the success of our global growth strategies as evidenced by our strong sales and earnings performance in the quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. We experienced double-digit sales growth in the majority of our Asia and Latin America markets. Results for the U.S. business reflect share gains from our product innovation, offset by an overall decline in the market and a tough comparison with the third quarter of 2010 when a competitor commenced a product recall. We continue to invest in demand-generation activities for long-term growth. Strong sales, favorable foreign exchange impacts and a lower effective tax rate contributed to excellent earnings performance in the quarter.
Third Quarter Results
Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, totaled $933.9 million, up 15 percent from $810.2 million a year ago. Sales benefited 7 percent from volume, 4 percent from price and 4 percent from foreign exchange. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) for the third quarter totaled $201.7 million, up from $165.5 million a year earlier. The EBIT increase was primarily due to higher sales, favorable foreign exchange impact and lower pension settlement costs, partially offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs and increased demand-generation investments.
Gross margin was down 180 basis points versus the third quarter of 2010 due to higher dairy and other commodity costs, manufacturing inefficiencies and additional airfreight costs to rebalance inventories across the globe, in part to support growth in China. Operating expense increased from higher sales force and distribution expenses, advertising and promotion investments and performance-based compensation. The third quarter of 2011 also benefited from foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement gains on U.S. dollar denominated receivables at foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6 percent versus 30.0 percent a year ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a change in geographic earnings mix, manufacturing, research and development incentives and other favorable return-to-provision adjustments. In addition, standard quarterly accruals were necessary to record our tax liability using the latest full-year projected effective tax rate.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $144.7 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared with $106.1 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for the prior-year quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $161.0 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $117.8 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
Third Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $636.1 million for the third quarter of 2011, up 30 percent from $489.7 million in 2010. Sales benefited 19 percent from volume, 6 percent from price and 5 percent from foreign exchange. China/Hong Kong led the strong segment sales performance and nearly all Latin America markets delivered double-digit growth, resulting from market growth and market share gains. Also, Asia sales benefitted from increased retailer purchases in advance of the October 2011 transition to our new IT platform. EBIT totaled $198.4 million, up 18 percent compared with $168.0 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase in EBIT was due to strong sales, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion, sales force growth and new outsourced service costs.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $297.8 million for the third quarter of 2011, down 7 percent from $320.5 million in 2010. Sales benefited 2 percent from price and 1 percent from foreign exchange, offset by a 10 percent decline in volume. The U.S. market share remains above third quarter of 2010, while overall market size had continued to decline. In the third quarter of 2010, U.S. sales benefitted from increased demand due to a competitors infant formula product recall and increased retailer purchases in advance of the fourth quarter 2010 transition to our new IT platform. EBIT totaled $71.9 million, compared with $97.4 million in the third quarter a year ago. The decrease was the result of lower sales and new outsourced service costs.
Corporate and Other expense decreased due to foreign exchange impacts from assets held in non-functional currencies and $9.1 million in pension settlement costs in 2010 but not yet incurred in year-to-date 2011, partially offset by an increase in IT separation costs.
Nine-Month Results
Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, totaled $2,765.7 million, up 18 percent from $2,337.9 million a year ago. Sales benefited 12 percent from volume, 3 percent from price, and 3 percent from foreign exchange. EBIT for the first three quarters of 2011 totaled $628.0 million, up from $536.3 million a year earlier. The EBIT increase was driven by higher sales, partially offset by increased demand-generation investments, IT separation costs, and shared service overlap costs.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was 27.1 percent versus 28.6 percent a year ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a change in geographic earnings mix, manufacturing, research and development incentives and other favorable return-to-provision adjustments, compared with unfavorable return-to-provision adjustments in 2010.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the first nine months of 2011 totaled $422.9 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared with $353.1 million, or $1.72 per diluted share for the prior-year period.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $466.5 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, for the first three quarters of 2011, compared with $381.7 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.
Nine-Month Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $1,824.6 million for the first three quarters of 2011, up 29 percent from $1,417.4 million in 2010. Sales benefited 19 percent from volume, 5 percent from price and 5 percent from foreign exchange. The majority of the markets in the segment had double-digit constant-dollar sales growth driven by market growth and market share gains. The strongest performance continues to be in China/Hong Kong. EBIT for the segment totaled $625.0 million, up 27 percent compared with $492.0 million for the year-ago period. The EBIT increase was primarily related to sales growth, partially offset by increased demand-generation investments, performance-based compensation and new outsourced service costs.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $941.1 million for the first three quarters of 2011, up from $920.5 million in 2010. Sales benefited 1 percent from volume and 1 percent from foreign exchange. The segment sales were driven by U.S. market share gains from product innovations and the effects of a competitors product recall late in 2010, partially offset by lower U.S. births and consumption. EBIT totaled $251.2 million, compared with $272.7 million in the same period a year ago. Sales growth was offset by sales force and distribution expense and new outsourced service costs.
Corporate and Other expense increased due to additional IT separation costs, partially offset by $9.1 million in pension settlement costs in 2010 not incurred year-to-date 2011.
Outlook for 2011
For the full year, we anticipate annual net sales to be up by about 14 percent on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year, Mr. Golsby said. We expect annual gross margin to be slightly less than 63 percent due to the third quarter non-recurring manufacturing inefficiencies and additional airfreight cost to rebalance inventories, in part to support excellent growth in China. We expect operating costs of about 39.7 percent of sales, which includes our continued demand-generation investments in core and new markets to drive future sales growth. We estimate the effective tax rate will be slightly below 28 percent. Considering these factors, and our strong year-to-date performance and positive outlook, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP earnings estimate to $2.73 to $2.78 per share.
