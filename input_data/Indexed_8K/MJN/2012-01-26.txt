Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Reports 17 Percent Sales Growth in 2011 and Delivers Non-GAAP EPS Growth of 15 Percent;
Provides Initial 2012 Guidance
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 26, 2012--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2011.
Net sales for 2011 were up 17 percent to $3,677.0 million from $3,141.6 million in 2010. Asia/Latin America grew 26 percent and North America/Europe grew 3 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 14 percent.
GAAP net earnings of $2.47 per diluted share for 2011 increased from $2.20 per diluted share in 2010.
Non-GAAPnet earnings of $2.79 per diluted share for 2011 were up 15 percent from $2.42 per diluted share a year earlier.
(1)
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 were up 13 percent, driven by continued strong performance in Asia/Latin America. The Asia/Latin America segment grew 17 percent and North America/Europe grew 6 percent. Excluding the unfavorable impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, sales increased 14 percent.
GAAP net earnings totaled $0.42 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, compared with $0.48 per diluted share a year ago, reflecting higher sales which were more than offset by the impact of increased demand-generation investments, higher commodity costs and the timing of pension settlement expenses and tax accruals.
Non-GAAPnet earnings totaled $0.52 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $0.57 in 2010.
The company provided initial full-year 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.00 to $3.10. Including specified items estimated at $0.09 per share, GAAP EPS guidance is $2.91 to $3.01.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
We delivered $0.52 in non-GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011, largely in line with our earlier expectations, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. On a full year basis, sales grew at a record rate of 17 percent with non-GAAP EPS up 15 percent. We achieved exceptional double-digit sales growth in Asia/Latin America. The North America/Europe segment grew in the low single-digits even as births continued to decline in these developed markets. We continued to increase investments in demand-generation activities to support our profitable growth. In addition, we achieved a record level of productivity, which helped reduce the impact of higher commodity costs. In 2011, we completed our SAP installation and shared service transition on time and for the first time in our history have a common global, and fully independent, IT platform. Our exceptional financial performance continues to reflect our strong global growth strategy, and we expect that 2012 will be another successful year for Mead Johnson.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 totaled $911.3 million, up 13 percent from $803.7 million a year ago. Sales benefited 11 percent from volume, 3 percent from price, offset by a 1 percent reduction from foreign exchange. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) for the fourth quarter totaled $146.1 million, largely flat compared to $146.6 million a year earlier. EBIT remained constant versus prior year primarily due to higher sales offset by increased demand-generation investments, higher commodity and manufacturing costs, and the timing for recognizing pension settlement expense and tax accruals.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $85.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with $99.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for the prior-year quarter.
The effective tax rate (ETR) for the quarter was 32.5 percent versus 24.6 percent a year ago. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in geographic earnings mix and year-end accruals to bring the full-year ETR to 28.1 percent in 2011 versus 27.8 percent in 2010.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $106.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $116.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment had net sales of $598.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, up 17 percent from $509.7 million in 2010. Sales benefited 14 percent from volume, 4 percent from price, partially offset by a 1 percent reduction from foreign exchange. China/Hong Kong led the strong segment sales performance, resulting from both market growth and market share gains. EBIT totaled $177.9 million, up 15 percent compared with $154.1 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase in EBIT was due to strong sales, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion and sales force investments, along with new outsourced service costs.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $312.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, up 6 percent from $294.0 million in 2010. Sales benefited 4 percent from volume, 3 percent from price, offset by a 1 percent reduction from foreign exchange. Volume increased from product innovation in Canada, growth of sales for a non-core product and a favorable comparison in Europe due to lower 2010 sales resulting from an anticipated change in the companys distribution model. U.S. volume was lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 when a competitor faced a product recall. EBIT totaled $65.9 million, compared with $85.0 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The decrease was the result of higher commodity costs and new outsourced service costs.
Corporate and Other expense increased primarily due to higher centralized marketing and R&D expense, and pension settlement costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 partially offset by lower unallocated shared service overlap costs. Similar pension settlement expenses had been realized in the third quarter of 2010.
Full-Year 2011 Results
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, net sales totaled $3,677.0 million, up 17 percent from $3,141.6 million for 2010. Sales benefited 11 percent from volume, 3 percent from price and 3 percent from foreign exchange. EBIT increased to $774.1 million, up from $682.9 million a year earlier. Net earnings attributable to shareholders for 2011 totaled $508.5 million, up 12 percent from $452.7 million in 2010. The year benefited from strong sales growth in the Asia/Latin America segment, led by China/Hong Kong with over 40 percent growth and Latin America with mid-teen growth. Pricing and productivity partially offset greater demand-generation investments, commodity cost increases and higher performance-based compensation expense. Results include $93.9 million and $71.4 million of specified items for 2011 and 2010 respectively, primarily for IT separation costs. Earnings per diluted share for 2011 were $2.47 compared with $2.20 in 2010.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the above-mentioned specified items, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $573.1 million, or $2.79 per diluted share, in 2011, compared with $498.2 million, or $2.42 per diluted share, in 2010.
Outlook for 2012
We look forward to further success in 2012 and to a year of solid sales and earnings growth, Mr. Golsby said. We are initiating 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $3.00 to $3.10, up from $2.79 per share in 2011.
Key assumptions underlying non-GAAP guidance include a net sales increase of 7 percent to 9 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange; higher raw material and packaging costs, offset by pricing and continued productivity gains; lower General and Administrative expenses with some savings reinvested to increase investments in demand-generation activities; and an effective tax rate between 27.5 percent and 28.5 percent.
