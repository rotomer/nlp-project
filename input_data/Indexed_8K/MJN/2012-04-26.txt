Exhibit 99.1
Mead Johnson Delivers 9 Percent Sales Growth; Reports Strong First Quarter Earnings; Raises Full-Year Guidance
GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2012--Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
Net sales of $986.6 million in the quarter increased 9 percent versus the first quarter of 2011.
GAAP net earnings of $0.80 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2012 were up by 13 percent from $0.71 per diluted share a year ago.
Non-GAAPnet earnings of $0.82 per diluted share increased 8 percent from $0.76 per diluted share for 2011.
(1)
Net sales were driven by the Asia/Latin America segment with growth of 22 percent with a majority of the markets achieving double-digit growth. Sales declined 12 percent for the North America/Europe segment as a result of lower market share and market contraction.
Earnings benefited from strong sales growth, a favorable foreign exchange comparison and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower gross margins and higher demand-generation investments.
Full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range increased to $3.04 to $3.14 from $3.00 to $3.10. Including specified items estimated at $0.09 per share, full-year GAAP EPS guidance is $2.95 to $3.05.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results included in this release.
We are very pleased with the continued strong sales and earnings growth we delivered in the first quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Golsby. Growth in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America was exceptional, led by China/Hong Kong and supported by double-digit increases in the majority of markets in the segment. Asia and Latin America now account for 71 percent of global sales. Our overall performance is particularly striking in light of the headwinds in the United States from factors outside of our control, including the 2011 benefit from a competitors recall, the impact of unfounded media reports in late December and a continued drop in births and consumption. We have confidence in the recovery of our U.S. market share as we move through the second half of the year. During the quarter, we increased demand-generation investments, along with research and development spending, to drive innovation and sustainable growth. We also completed the acquisition of an 80 percent equity interest in Argentinas leading infant formula and childrens nutrition brand, which expands our presence in the Southern Cone of the Latin American region. Our confidence has led us to increase sales and earnings guidance for the full year.
First Quarter Results
Net sales for the first quarter totaled $986.6 million, up 9 percent from $899.8 million a year ago. Sales benefited 5 percent from volume and 4 percent from price. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) for the first quarter totaled $248.8 million, up 12 percent from $222.6 million a year earlier. The EBIT increase was driven by sales growth and lower costs from the late 2011 completion of a new SAP technology platform and the elimination of duplicate costs from the overlap in shared service providers. These factors were partially offset by lower gross margins and higher demand-generation investments.
Gross margin was down 230 basis points versus the first quarter of 2011. The decrease was from unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher dairy costs, partially offset by higher pricing and productivity gains. The manufacturing variances were attributed to reduced fixed cost absorption from lower sales and production volumes in the U.S. The increase in demand-generation investments was from increased advertising and promotion, sales force, and research and development expenses. Foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement losses, mainly at our European manufacturing entity, were lower than a year ago.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders for the first quarter of 2012 totaled $164.2 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared with $146.1 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the prior-year quarter. The first quarter of 2012 benefited from a lower tax rate primarily attributable to a change in geographic earnings mix.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes specified items, the net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $167.4 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared with $156.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
First Quarter Segment Results
The Asia/Latin America segment delivered net sales of $701.3 million for the first quarter of 2012, up 22 percent from $576.9 million in 2011. Sales benefited 16 percent from volume, 5 percent from price and 1 percent from foreign exchange. EBIT totaled $279.0 million, up 29 percent compared with $216.8 million for the year-ago quarter. EBIT increased from strong sales due to market share gains as well as market growth, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion, sales force and distribution expenses.
The North America/Europe segment reported net sales of $285.3 million for the first quarter of 2012, down 12 percent from $322.9 million in 2011. Sales benefited 3 percent from price, offset by a 14 percent decline in volume and 1 percent from foreign exchange. The volume decrease, primarily in the U.S. market, reflected lower market share, reduced consumption and fewer births. Lower market share is attributed to both the benefit of a competitors recall in the prior year period and the current impact of unfounded media reports of alleged product contamination in December 2011. EBIT for the segment totaled $33.7 million, compared with $92.9 million for the year-ago quarter. The decrease was entirely attributed to a decline in gross profit due to unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher dairy costs and the decline in net sales. The manufacturing variances are attributed to reduced fixed cost absorption from lower sales and production volumes in the U.S.
Corporate and Other expenses decreased from the reduction of costs related to the late 2011 completion of a new SAP technology platform and the elimination of the duplicate costs incurred in 2011 from the overlap in shared service providers.
Outlook for 2012
We anticipate higher sales and earnings growth than in our previous guidance. Annual constant dollar sales growth is expected to be in the range of 9 percent to 11 percent. The increase in our sales outlook is largely attributable to the Argentine acquisition but also reflects slightly higher growth expectations in emerging markets. We expect our non-GAAP EBIT margin as a percentage of sales to be at or slightly above the level seen in 2011 and we are raising our full-year non-GAAP earnings estimate to $3.04 to $3.14 per share, Mr. Golsby noted.
