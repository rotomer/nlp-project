The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the date of redemption.
Notwithstanding Section 11.4 of the Indenture, dated as of December 5, 2000, between the Company and SunTrust Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"), the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Make-Whole Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.

McCORMICK & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, a Maryland corporation (herein referred to as the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS on the Stated Maturity Date shown above (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to the Stated Maturity Date) and to pay interest, if any, thereon at the Interest Rate shown above from the Original Issue Date shown above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest, if any, has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year (unless other Interest Payment Dates are shown on the face hereof) (each, an "Interest Payment Date") until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and on the Stated Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or Repayment Date (such terms are together hereinafter referred to as the "Maturity Date" with respect to the principal repayable on such date); provided, however, that any payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, to be made on any Interest Payment Date or on the Maturity Date that is not a Business Day (as defined below) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, and no additional interest, if any, shall accrue on the amount so payable as a result of such delayed payment.  For purposes of this Security, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, "Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York; provided, however, that, if the Specified Currency shown above is a foreign currency, such day is also not a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is the euro, such day is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open).  "Principal Financial Center" means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Deutsche marks, Dutch guilders, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "Principal Financial Center" shall be The City of New York, Sydney and (solely in the case of the Specified Currency) Melbourne, Toronto, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
 
Any interest hereon will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest, if any, has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.  The interest, if any, so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as referred to on the reverse hereof) and subject to certain exceptions described herein (referred to on the reverse hereof), be paid to the person (the "Holder") in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the March 31 or September 30 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date (unless other Regular Record Dates are specified on the face hereof) (each, a "Regular Record Date"); provided, however, that, if this Security was issued between a Regular Record Date and the initial Interest Payment Date relating to such Regular
 
Record Date, interest, if any, for the period beginning on the Original Issue Date and ending on such initial Interest Payment Date shall be paid on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the Holder hereof on such next succeeding Regular Record Date; and provided further that interest, if any, payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date ("Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (referred to on the reverse hereof), notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
 
Unless otherwise specified above, all payments in respect of this Security will be made in U.S. dollars regardless of the Specified Currency shown above unless the Holder hereof makes the election described below.  If the Specified Currency shown above is other than U.S. dollars, the Exchange Rate Agent (referred to on the reverse hereof) will arrange to convert any such amounts so payable in respect hereof into U.S. dollars in the manner described on the reverse hereof; provided, however, that the Holder hereof may, if so indicated above, elect to receive all or any specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Security in such Specified Currency by delivery of a written request to the corporate trust office of the Trustee in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at c/o Harris Trust Bank of New York, Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street, 19 Floor, New York, New York 10005, or at such other office in The City of New York, as the Company may determine, on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least fifteen days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.  Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or by facsimile transmission.  The Holder hereof may elect to receive payment in such Specified Currency for all principal, premium, if any, and interest payments, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least fifteen days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
th
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines that the Specified Currency is not available for making payments in respect hereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control, or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then the Holder hereof may not so elect to receive payments in the Specified Currency and any such outstanding election shall be automatically suspended, until the Company determines that the Specified Currency is again available for making such payments.  Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in a Specified Currency will not constitute a default under the Indenture.
 
In the event of an official redenomination of the Specified Currency, the obligations of the Company with respect to payments on this Security, in all cases, shall be deemed immediately following such redenomination to provide for payment of that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination.  In no event shall any adjustment be made to any amount payable hereunder as a result of any change in the value of the Specified Currency shown above relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates.
 
Until this Security is paid in full or payment therefor in full is duly provided for, the Company will at all times maintain a Paying Agent (which Paying Agent may be the Trustee) in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at c/o Harris Trust Bank of New York, Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street, 19 Floor, New York, New York 10005, or at such other office in The City of New York, as the Company may determine (which, unless otherwise specified above, shall be the "Place of Payment").  The Company has initially appointed SunTrust Bank, at its office in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at c/o Harris Trust Bank of New York, Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street, 19 Floor, New York, New York 10005.
th
th
 
Unless otherwise shown above, payment of interest on this Security (other than on the Maturity Date) will be made by check mailed to the registered address of the Holder hereof as of the Regular Record Date; provided, however, that, if (i) the Specified Currency is U.S. dollars and this is a Global Security (as defined on the reverse hereof) or (ii) the Specified Currency is a foreign currency, and the Holder has elected to receive payments in such Specified Currency as provided for above, such interest payments will be made by transfer of immediately available funds, but only if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date.  Simultaneously with any election by the Holder hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency (if other than U.S. dollars), such Holder may provide appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee, and all such payments will be made in immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank, but only if such bank has appropriate facilities therefor.  Unless otherwise specified above, the principal hereof (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, hereon payable on the Maturity Date will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of this Security at the office of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at c/o Harris Trust Bank of New York, Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street, 19 Floor, New York, New York 10005, or at such other office in The City of New York, as the Company may determine.  The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in making payments in immediately available funds, but any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such payments are made.
th
 
Interest on this Security, if any, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
Section 1.  General.  This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of December5, 2000, as it may be supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and SunTrust Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to a series of which this Security is a part), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series of Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes", limited in aggregate principal amount to U.S. $375,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign currencies) or such other principal amount as shall be provided pursuant to the Indenture.
 
Section 2.  Payments.  If the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars and the Holder hereof fails to elect payment in such Specified Currency in accordance with the procedures set forth on the face hereof, the amount of U.S. dollar payments to be made in respect hereof will be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent specified on the face hereof or a successor thereto (the "Exchange Rate Agent") based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date received by the Exchange Rate Agent from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all holders of Securities scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments will be made in the Specified Currency.
 
If the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars and the Holder hereof has elected payment in such Specified Currency in accordance with the procedures set forth on the face hereof and the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Company's control, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Security by making such payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of such Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Market Exchange Rate") as computed by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to the applicable payment date or, if the Market Exchange Rate is then not available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or as otherwise indicated above.  Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in a Specified Currency will not constitute a default under the Indenture.
 
All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion (except to the extent expressly provided that any determination is subject to approval by the Company) and, in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive for all
 
purposes and binding on the Holder of this Security, and the Exchange Rate Agent shall have no liability therefor.
 
All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Company.
 
References herein to "U.S. dollars" or "U.S. $" or "$" are to the currency of the United States of America.
 
Section 3.  Redemption.  The Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or from time to time in part, at the Make-Whole Price (as defined below).  The Company may exercise such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.  In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.  If less than all of the Securities with like tenor and terms to this Security are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.  However, if less than all the Securities of the series with differing tenor and terms to this Security are to be redeemed, then the Company in its sole discretion shall select the particular Securities to be redeemed and shall notify the Trustee in writing thereof at least 60 days prior to the relevant Redemption Date.  Notwithstanding Section 11.4 of the Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Make-Whole Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.  The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Make-Whole Price with respect to any redemption promptly after the calculation thereof, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
 
"Make-Whole Price" means an amount equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Security to be redeemed and (ii) as determined by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 10 basis points, plus, in the case of both (i) and (ii), accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Make-Whole Price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on this Security to be redeemed.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Security to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any date of redemption, (i) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Goldman, Sachs & Co., Banc of America Securities LLC and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall not be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any two other Primary Treasury Dealers the Company selects.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any date of redemption, (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15 (519)" or any successor publication that is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and that establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the stated maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined, and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption.
