Unless statute or the Charter provides otherwise, at a meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except that a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect a director.  Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned from time to time without further notice by a majority vote of the stockholders present in person or by proxy to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date.

In all elections for directors, each share of stock may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted.  A stockholder may vote the stock the stockholder owns of record either in person or by proxy.  A stockholder may sign a writing authorizing another person to act as proxy.  Signing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized agent signing the writing or causing the stockholder's signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including facsimile signature.  A stockholder may authorize another person to act as proxy by transmitting, or authorizing the transmission of, a telegram, cablegram, datagram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person authorized to act as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or other person authorized by the person who will act as proxy to receive the transmission.  Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than 11 months after its date.  A proxy is revocable by a stockholder at any time without condition or qualification unless the proxy states that it is irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest.  A proxy may be made irrevocable for so long as it is coupled with an interest.  The interest with which a proxy may be coupled includes an interest in the stock to be voted under the proxy or another general interest in the Corporation or its assets or liabilities.

A request for a special meeting shall state the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it.  The Secretary shall inform the stockholders who make the request of the reasonably estimated costs of preparing and mailing a notice of the meeting and, on payment of these costs to the Corporation, notify each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting.  Unless requested by stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, a special meeting need not be called to consider any matter which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting of stockholders held in the preceding 12 months.

If demanded by stockholders, present in person or by proxy, entitled to cast 25% in number of votes entitled to be cast, or if ordered by the chairman, the vote upon any election or questions shall be taken by ballot and, upon like demand or order, the voting shall be conducted by two inspectors, in which event the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided, by such inspectors.  Unless so demanded or ordered, no vote need be by ballot and voting need not be conducted by inspectors.
