FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
SPARKS, MD, MAY 2 - - - McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of the remaining 49% share of Dessert Products International, S.A.S. (DPI) from Hero A.G. in exchange for its 50% interest in the Signature Brands, LLC joint venture.  The initial agreement for these transactions was first announced on February 17, 2006.  The Company had acquired a 51% interest in the DPI business as part of the acquisition of the Ducros business in August 2000.  As a result of this transaction, McCormick now has 100% ownership of DPI, which markets the Vahine brand in France and other European countries.
 
Robert J. Lawless, Chairman, President & CEO of McCormick, stated, "This action is another step in McCormick's plan to simplify its business and focus on those areas with strong growth potential.  Vahine is the leading brand of dessert aids in France and other European countries.  Since acquiring a 51% interest in this business in 2000, product innovation and expanded distribution have increased sales and net income more than 50%."
 
As previously announced, the impact of this exchange on McCormick's ongoing sales and net income is expected to be neutral.  However, in the second quarter, the Company expects to record a net gain after-tax of approximately $27 million that will increase 2006 earnings per share approximately 20.  The Company has increased its projected earnings per share for 2006 from a range of $1.21-$1.24 to a range of $1.41-$1.44.  This range still includes the impact of special charges in connection with the previously announced restructuring plan which are projected to be 42, as well as 11 of stock-based compensation expense that the Company began to record in 2006.
