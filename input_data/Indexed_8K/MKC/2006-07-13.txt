No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the
provided
however
(d). If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(2) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
           Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 8.           . If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
21
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Notes as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A.
22
SECTION 9.           . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.

. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, if (i) there has been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii)  there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable to market the Notes or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission, the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by either of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities, or (v) there has occurred a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance systems.
(b)          Termination of this Agreement by the Underwriters
(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 10, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 5 hereof, and that Sections 1, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

(a)           if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Notes to be purchased on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof which such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date, or
Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7 and Section 8 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
(b)           if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Notes to be purchased on such date and arrangements satisfactory to the non-defaulting
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 11. No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
SECTION 12.         . The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the offering price of the Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its affiliates, shareholders or employees; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent

McCORMICK & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, a Maryland corporation (herein referred to as the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of U.S.$100,000,000 on the Stated Maturity Date shown above (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to the Stated Maturity Date) and to pay interest, if any, thereon at the Interest Rate shown above from the Original Issue Date shown above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest, if any, has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (unless other Interest Payment Dates are shown on the face hereof) (each, an "Interest Payment Date") until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and on the Stated Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or Repayment Date (such terms are together hereinafter referred to as the "Maturity Date" with respect to the principal repayable on such date); provided, however, that any payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, to be made on any Interest Payment Date or on the Maturity Date that is not a Business Day (as defined below) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, and no additional interest, if any, shall accrue on the amount so payable as a result of such delayed payment. For purposes of this Security, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, "Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York; provided, however, that, if the Specified Currency shown above is a foreign currency, such day is also not a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is the euro, such day is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open). "Principal Financial Center" means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Deutsche marks, Dutch guilders, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "Principal Financial Center" shall be The City of New York, Sydney and (solely in the case of the Specified Currency) Melbourne, Toronto, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
Any interest hereon will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest, if any, has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. The interest, if any, so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain exceptions described herein (referred to on the reverse hereof), be paid to the person (the "Holder") in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date (unless other Regular Record Dates are specified on the face hereof) (each, a "Regular Record Date"); provided, however, that, if this Security was issued between a Regular Record Date and the initial Interest Payment Date relating to such Regular Record Date, interest, if any, for the period beginning on the Original Issue Date and ending on such initial Interest Payment Date shall be paid on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding
3
Regular Record Date to the Holder hereof on such next succeeding Regular Record Date; and provided further that interest, if any, payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date ("Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (referred to on the reverse hereof), notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
Unless otherwise specified above, all payments in respect of this Security will be made in U.S. dollars regardless of the Specified Currency shown above unless the Holder hereof makes the election described below. If the Specified Currency shown above is other than U.S. dollars, the Exchange Rate Agent (referred to on the reverse hereof) will arrange to convert any such amounts so payable in respect hereof into U.S. dollars in the manner described on the reverse hereof; provided, however, that the Holder hereof may, if so indicated above, elect to receive all or any specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Security in such Specified Currency by delivery of a written request to the corporate trust office of the Trustee in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at SunTrust Bank, c/o SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets, 3
rd
 Floor, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, or at such other office in The City of New York, as the Company may determine, on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least fifteen days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission. The Holder hereof may elect to receive payment in such Specified Currency for all principal, premium, if any, and interest payments, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least fifteen days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines that the Specified Currency is not available for making payments in respect hereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control, or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then the Holder hereof may not so elect to receive payments in the Specified Currency and any such outstanding election shall be automatically suspended, until the Company determines that the Specified Currency is again available for making such payments. Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in a Specified Currency will not constitute a default under the Indenture.
In the event of an official redenomination of the Specified Currency, the obligations of the Company with respect to payments on this Security, in all cases, shall be deemed immediately following such redenomination to provide for payment of that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such
4
redenomination. In no event shall any adjustment be made to any amount payable hereunder as a result of any change in the value of the Specified Currency shown above relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates.
Until this Security is paid in full or payment therefor in full is duly provided for, the Company will at all times maintain a Paying Agent (which Paying Agent may be the Trustee) in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at SunTrust Bank, c/o SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets, 3
rd
 Floor, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, or at such other office in The City of New York, as the Company may determine (which, unless otherwise specified above, shall be the "Place of Payment"). The Company has initially appointed SunTrust Bank, at its office in The City of New York, currently the office of the Trustee located at SunTrust Bank, c/o SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets, 3
rd
 Floor, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, or at such other office in The City of New York as the Company may determine as Paying Agent.
Unless otherwise shown above, payment of interest on this Security (other than on the Maturity Date) will be made by check mailed to the registered address of the Holder hereof as of the Regular Record Date; provided, however, that, if (i) the Specified Currency is U.S. dollars and this is a Global Security (as defined on the reverse hereof) or (ii) the Specified Currency is a Foreign Currency, and the Holder has elected to receive payments in such Specified Currency as provided for above, such interest payments will be made by transfer of immediately available funds, but only if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date. Simultaneously with any election by the Holder hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency (if other than U.S. dollars), such Holder may provide appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee, and all such payments will be made in immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank, but only if such bank has appropriate facilities therefor. Unless otherwise specified above, the principal hereof (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, hereon payable on the Maturity Date will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of this Security at the office of the Trustee maintained for that purpose at SunTrust Bank, c/o SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets, 3
rd
 Floor, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, or at such other office in The City of New York, as the Company may determine. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in making payments in immediately available funds but, except as otherwise provided under Additional Amounts above, any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such payments are made.
Interest on this Security, if any, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Section 1.   General.   This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under that certain Indenture, dated as of December 5, 2000, as it may be supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and SunTrust Bank, Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to a series of which this Security is a part), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
Section 2.   Payments.   If the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars and the Holder hereof fails to elect payment in such Specified Currency in accordance with the procedures set forth on the face hereof, the amount of U.S. dollar payments to be made in respect hereof will be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent specified on the face hereof or a successor thereto (the "Exchange Rate Agent") based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date received by the Exchange Rate Agent from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all holders of Securities scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations are not available, payments will be made in the Specified Currency.
If the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars and the Holder hereof has elected payment in such Specified Currency in accordance with the procedures set forth on the face hereof and the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Company's control, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Security by making such payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of such Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Market Exchange Rate") as computed by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to the applicable payment date or, if the Market Exchange Rate is then not available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or as otherwise indicated above. Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in a Specified Currency will not constitute a default under the Indenture.
8
All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion (except to the extent expressly provided that any determination is subject to approval by the Company) and, in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Security, and the Exchange Rate Agent shall have no liability therefor.
All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Company.
References herein to "U.S. dollars" or "U.S. $" or "$" are to the currency of the United States of America.
Section 3.   Redemption.   If so specified on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the Minimum Denomination specified on the face hereof) at the greater of (i) 100% of the unpaid principal amount hereof or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. The Company may exercise such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Securities with like tenor and terms to this Security are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. However, if less than all the Securities of the series with differing tenor and terms to this Security are to be redeemed, then the Company in its sole discretion shall select the particular Securities to be redeemed and shall notify the Trustee in writing thereof at least 45 days prior to the relevant Redemption Date.
Section 4.   Repayment.   If so specified on the face hereof, this Security shall be repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date at the option of the Holder on each applicable Optional Repayment Date shown on the face hereof at a repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date. In order for this Security to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at least 30 but not more than 45 days prior to an Optional Repayment Date, this Security with the form attached hereto entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed. Any tender of this Security for repayment shall be irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised by the Holder of this Security in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the Minimum Denomination specified on the face hereof).

original issue discount instruments), than the stated redemption price at maturity (as defined below) hereof and (b) would be considered an original issue discount security for United States federal income tax purposes, then the amount payable on this Security in the event of redemption by the Company, repayment at the option of the Holder or acceleration of the maturity hereof, in lieu of the principal amount due at the Stated Maturity Date hereof, shall be the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of this Security as of the date of such redemption, repayment or acceleration. The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Security shall be the amount equal to the sum of (a) the Issue Price (as set forth on the face hereof) plus (b) the aggregate of the portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Security within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), whether denominated as principal or interest, over the Issue Price of this Security) which shall theretofore have accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section 1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the date of issue of this Security to the date of determination, minus (c) any amount considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Security which has been paid on this Security from the date of issue to the date of determination.
Section 6.   Modification and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute.   The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series. Such amendment may be effected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Securities of each series affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all Outstanding Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture. Provisions in the Indenture also permit the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities of any series to waive on behalf of all of the Holders of Securities of such series certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this Security and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
The Securities are unsecured and rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the Specified Currency herein prescribed, except as set forth in Section 2 hereof.
Section 7.   Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.   The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness of the Company on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and the related defaults and Events of Default, upon compliance

Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations herein and therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at a Place of Payment for the series of Securities of which this Security forms a part, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of like authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
If the registered owner of this Security is the Depository (such a Security being referred to as a "Global Security"), and (i) the Depository is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days following notice to the Company or (ii) an Event of Default occurs, the Company will issue Securities in certificated form in exchange for this Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time, and in its sole discretion, determine not to have Securities represented by a Global Security and, in such event, will issue Securities in certificated form in exchange in whole for this Global Security. In any exchange pursuant to this paragraph, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities of this series in exchange for this Global Security, will authenticate and deliver individual Securities of this series in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange herefor. Securities issued in exchange for this Global Security pursuant to this paragraph shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in this Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. For purposes of the Indenture, this Global Security constitutes a Security issued in permanent global form. Securities so issued in certificated form will be issued in denominations of $1,000 (or such other denomination as shall be specified on the face hereof) or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, this Security is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of different authorized denominations but otherwise having the same terms and conditions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the same.
11
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 10.   Events of Default.   If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security forms a part shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
Section 11.   Defined Terms.   All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture and are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

This opinion letter is based as to matters of law solely on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, judicial authority, current administrative rulings and practice, and existing and proposed Treasury Regulations, all as in effect and existing on the date hereof (collectively, ""). These provisions and interpretations are subject to changes, which may or may not be retroactive in effect, that might result in material modifications of our opinion. We express no opinion herein as to any other laws, statutes, regulations, or ordinances. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "") or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, although we believe that our opinion set forth herein will be sustained if challenged, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue is not binding on
federal income tax laws
IRS
the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.
In rendering the following opinion, we have examined such statutes, regulations, records, certificates and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for such opinion, including (but not limited to) the following: (i) an executed copy of the Registration Statement; (ii) the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement; (iii) a specimen copy of the Notes; and (iv) an executed copy of the Indenture, dated as of December 5, 2000, between the Company and SunTrust Bank, as trustee, as supplemented by the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the Notes.
In our review, we have assumed that all of the representations and statements set forth in such documents are true and correct, and all of the obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto have been and will continue to be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms. We also have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the accuracy and completeness of all documents submitted to us, the authenticity of all original documents, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies (including telecopies). This opinion letter is given, and all statements herein are made, in the context of the foregoing.
For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any of the above-referenced documents, including the Prospectus. We have consequently relied upon representations and information presented in such documents.
Based upon, and subject to, the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the discussion in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences," to the extent that it describes provisions of federal income tax law, is correct in all material respects as of the date hereof.
We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the effective date of the Registration Statement. This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement on the date of this opinion letter and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to, nor filed with or furnished to, any other governmental agency or other person or entity without the prior written consent of this firm.
