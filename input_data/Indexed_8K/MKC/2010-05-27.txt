Item 5.02(d) Election of New Director.
Effective May 25, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Registrant elected Patricia Little to the Board of Directors of the Registrant. Ms. Little became a member of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on the same date.
Ms. Little is the Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer of Kelly Services, Inc.
There are no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Little and any other persons pursuant to which Ms. Little was selected as a director.
Ms. Little will participate in the compensation arrangements for non-executive directors described on pages 15 and 16 of the Registrant's Definitive Proxy Statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2010, subject to the following paragraph.
On May 25, 2010, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved a change in the annual retainer of $65,000 (which is paid in equal quarterly installments of $16,250) provided to non-executive directors. Beginning on May 25, 2010, any new director (including Ms. Little) elected to the Board of Directors of the Registrant will receive his/her first quarterly retainer in shares of the Registrant's Common Stock rather than cash, prorated to reflect the commencement date of service with the Board within the quarter. The number of shares of Common Stock that will be received by the new director will be the quotient of $16,250 (prorated) divided by the closing price of the Registrant's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the date of the new director's election to the Board; provided, if the Registrant's Common Stock does not trade on such date, then the most recent closing price of the Common Stock on the NYSE prior to that date shall be the closing price used for the calculation described above. Ms. Little did not participate in the Board discussion or vote on the aforementioned matter.
There have been no transactions, nor are there any currently proposed transactions, to which the Registrant was or is to be a party and with which Ms. Little or any member of her immediate family had, or will have, a direct or indirect material interest.
Furnished with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of the press release labeled "McCormick Appoints Patricia Little to Board of Directors."
Item 5.03(a) Amendment to Bylaws.
Effective May 25, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Registrant adopted an amendment to the Registrant's By-Laws to remove the age limit after which non-employee directors shall be ineligible for election or re-election to the Board of Directors. The Registrant's policy concerning retirement age of directors is contained in the Registrant's Corporate Governance Guidelines, as described below.
Effective May 25, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Registrant adopted an amendment to the Registrant's Corporate Governance Guidelines to specify that non-executive directors shall tender their resignation to the Chairman of the Board upon reaching age 72, which resignation shall be effective at the end of the month during which they attain age 72, following which they shall be ineligible for election or re-election to the Board.
Filed with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 3(ii) are the By-Laws of McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Amended and Restated on May 25, 2010.

Quorum; Voting; Adjournments
(a) Unless statute or the Charter provides otherwise, at a meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except as provided in the next sentence.
(b) Except as provided in Section 21 of these By-Laws or as otherwise required by law or the Charter, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality at the meeting at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Section 6(b), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director.
(c) Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned from time to time without further notice by the chair of the meeting or by a majority vote of the stockholders present in person or by proxy to a date not more than one-hundred and twenty (120) days after the original record date.

In all elections for directors, each share of stock may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted.
(b) A stockholder may vote the stock the stockholder owns of record either in person or by proxy. A stockholder may sign a writing authorizing another person to act as proxy.

(c) Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than 11 months after its date. A proxy is revocable by a stockholder at any time without condition or qualification unless the proxy states that it is irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest. A proxy may be made irrevocable for so long as it is coupled with an interest. The interest with which a proxy may be coupled includes an interest in the stock to be voted under the proxy or another general interest in the Corporation or its assets or liabilities.
