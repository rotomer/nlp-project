Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SPARKS, MD, JANUARY 26  McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC), a global leader in flavor, today reported record results for fiscal year 2010.
 
 
 
Alan D. Wilson, Chairman, President & CEO, commented, "In an economic environment that remains difficult in many of our major markets, we delivered strong financial performance that met or exceeded each of our financial goals for 2010. Our growth initiatives and operational achievements drove increases in both sales and profit. Interest in flavor continues to grow and consumers and customers rely on McCormick for great-tasting, high quality products. That's the essence of our business - we bring passion to flavor.
"In 2010 we grew sales with new product innovation and expanded distribution, as well as a $21 million increase in brand marketing support. This investment in our brands was fueled by our margin improvement. To achieve this higher margin, we improved productivity and reduced costs throughout our operations with CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program. Cost savings reached $54 million in 2010, which was 35% ahead of our initial target for the year. Margins were also positively impacted by our progress toward a more favorable mix of products in our industrial business. We not only improved gross profit margin for the total Company, but reached an 8% operating income margin for our industrial business. I want to recognize the contributions of all McCormick employees around the world for their role in achieving our 2010 results.
"Toward the end of a record 2010, McCormick investors shared in the success of the Company with a 25
th
consecutive annual dividend increase. With this increase, we were pleased to be added by Standard & Poor's to their S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index that includes fewer than 50 companies. As we look ahead to 2011 we are excited about our line-up of new products, brand marketing plans, distribution expansion opportunities and further progress with CCI, and expect a year of solid sales and earnings growth."
Fiscal Year 2010 Results
Earnings per share for the fiscal year rose to $2.75 compared to $2.27 in 2009. In 2010 the reversal of a significant tax accrual increased earnings per share $0.10, and in 2009 restructuring charges lowered earnings per share $0.08. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted earnings per share in 2010 was $2.65, an increase of $0.30 from adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 in 2009. This was a 13% increase which exceeded the Company's initial projection of 6% - 8% earnings growth on a comparable basis.
Adjusted operating income, which excludes restructuring charges recorded in 2009, grew 6%, adding $0.14 to earnings per share. Sales rose 5% and in local currency grew 3%, which was within the Company's targeted increase in local currency of 2% - 4%. A $21 million increase in brand marketing support, new product introductions and expanded distribution each contributed to this sales growth. Gross profit margin ended the year at 42.5% compared to 41.6% in 2009. This result exceeded expectations due in large part to CCI cost savings which reached $54 million in 2010, a result that was well ahead of the initial target of $35-$40 million.
As indicated, the Company's 2010 tax rate was affected by the reversal of a significant tax accrual which added $0.10 to earnings per share. Another $0.12 was added to earnings per share from a lower tax rate primarily due to increased foreign tax credits in the U.S. that resulted from the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries. Higher income from unconsolidated operations added $0.07 to earnings per share with an excellent financial performance from the Company's joint venture in Mexico. In total, McCormick's joint ventures grew sales 12%, operating income 33% and net income 56%.
To summarize the factors affecting adjusted earnings per share* in 2010 when compared to 2009:
 
 
The Company achieved $388 million in cash flow from operations in 2010. Following improvements in its cash conversion cycle in both 2008 and 2009, the Company removed three days in 2010, primarily from improved collection of receivables. Cash was used to reduce $114 million of debt, as well as to fund dividend payments and capital expenditures. In the second half of the year, the Company resumed its share repurchase program and used $83 million for this purpose.
Fourth Quarter Results for Fiscal Year 2010
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2010 rose to $0.99 compared to $0.87 in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $0.12. Excluding the $0.04 impact of restructuring charges recorded in 2009, earnings per share rose $0.08 from 2009. The primarily reason for this increase was a favorable tax rate which was primarily due to increased foreign tax credits in the U.S. that resulted from the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries.
The Company achieved strong fourth quarter sales growth in both its consumer and industrial businesses as a result of new products, brand marketing support and expanded distribution. Profit from higher sales and CCI cost savings, was largely offset in the fourth quarter by a $7 million increase in brand marketing support and an increase in raw and packaging material costs. The cost of a number of the spices and herbs, as well as packaging materials, rose sharply toward the end of 2010, and the Company has taken pricing actions in response to these increases.
Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2011
Higher sales and further progress with CCI are expected to deliver solid earnings growth in fiscal year 2011.
Sales are projected to grow 5% - 7% in local currency. Based on current rates, the Company anticipates that foreign currency exchange rates will add another 1% to sales in 2011. Included in the 5% - 7% sales growth range is an expected 3% increase from pricing. New products, brand marketing and expanded distribution -in both developed and emerging markets - are expected to grow sales 2% - 4%. The Company plans to increase brand marketing in line with sales growth in 2011.
The Company has set a target to achieve cost savings in 2011 of at least $40 million from its CCI program. Projects are already underway that are expected to deliver this target. The Company anticipates that its cost savings and pricing actions will provide an offset to rising input costs, with gross profit margin down slightly in 2011.
An estimated tax rate of 31% is projected for 2011 compared to a 2010 rate of 26%, which included the reversal of a significant tax accrual and the benefits of a cash repatriation program. Following a 56% increase in income from unconsolidated operations in 2010, the Company expects a slight decline in its 2011 profit from joint ventures due in part to higher material costs.
Earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.85. This is a 6% - 8% increase from 2010 on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of the reversal of a significant tax accrual in 2010.
Business Segment Fourth Quarter Results for Fiscal Year 2010
 
Consumer business sales rose 6% in the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by new products, brand marketing programs and expanded distribution.
 
 
Consumer business operating income was $159 million in the fourth quarter, which declined slightly from the year-ago period on a comparable basis excluding restructuring charges recorded in 2009. During this period, the impact of higher sales and CCI cost savings was offset in part by a $7 million increase in brand marketing support to drive sales in the fourth quarter and into 2011. Profit was also impacted by the rising costs of raw and packaging materials. The Company took pricing actions in late 2010 and early in fiscal year 2011 in response to these increased material costs.
 
Industrial business sales rose 7% in the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year period and in local currency the increase was 6%. During this period, customer demand and new items led to favorable volume and product mix with strong increases in each of the Company's three regions.
 
 
 
Industrial business operating income was $27 million in the fourth quarter, which was a strong 17% increase from the year-ago period on a comparable basis excluding restructuring charges recorded in 2009. A more favorable business mix and productivity improvements is leading to increased operating income as well as higher margins. For fiscal year 2010, operating income margin reached 8.0% compared to 6.7% for fiscal year 2009 when restructuring charges are excluded.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP information in this press release is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The non-GAAP information in this press release excludes the reversal of a significant tax accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2009. Management believes the non-GAAP information is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our on-going operations and analyze the Company's business performance and trends. Management believes the non-GAAP measure provides a more consistent basis for assessing the Company's performance than the closest GAAP equivalent. Management therefore uses the non-GAAP information alongside the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this press release.
Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company has provided below certain non-GAAP financial results excluding amounts related to the reversal of a significant tax accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and a restructuring program which ended in 2009.
