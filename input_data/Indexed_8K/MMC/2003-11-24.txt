SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 -------------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Item 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure As of the close of business on November 21, 2003, Putnam Investments had $247 billion in assets under management. Mutual fund assets were $163 billion. Institutional assets were $84 billion. To date, Putnam has found that there has been sufficient liquidity in the market to manage the client withdrawals and redemptions without any increase in portfolio transaction costs. There can be no assurance about future market conditions. Asset balances do not reflect pending redemptions or investments based on client decisions communicated to Putnam but not yet implemented. After the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, MMC and Putnam no longer expect to disclose Putnam's assets under management on Form 8-K but will return to their prior practice of posting updates to their websites. The next posting will take place at the close of business on December 1, 2003. Investors can link to MMC and its operating company websites through www.mmc.com.
