AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of the 18th day of May, 2004, by and among Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MMC"), King Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MMC ("Merger Sub"), and Kroll Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Kroll"). RECITALS WHEREAS, MMC and Kroll desire that MMC combine its businesses with the businesses operated by Kroll through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Kroll, with Kroll as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), pursuant to which each share of common stock of Kroll, par value $0.01 per share ("Kroll Common Stock") issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), other than the shares of Kroll Common Stock owned by MMC, Merger Sub or Kroll (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.3)) and other than the Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)), will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(b)), all as more fully provided in this Agreement; and WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to MMC's willingness to enter into this Agreement, MMC and certain Kroll Stockholders (as defined in Section 1.6(a)) are entering into a Support Agreement, of even date herewith, in respect of shares of Kroll Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholders (the "Support Agreement"); and WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to MMC's willingness to enter into this Agreement, MMC and certain Kroll executive officers and employees are entering into employment agreement term sheets, of even date herewith; and WHEREAS, the board of directors (the "Board") of each of MMC, Merger Sub and Kroll has determined that the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders; and WHEREAS, MMC, Merger Sub and Kroll desire to make those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, MMC, Merger Sub and Kroll agree as follows: -1-
ARTICLE I THE MERGER 1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Kroll at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Kroll shall continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of MMC under the laws of the State of Delaware. Kroll, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation." 1.2. CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. A closing (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, N.Y. 10019, or such other place as the parties hereto may agree, as soon as practicable but no later than the second business day following the date upon which all conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied or waived, or at such other date as MMC and Kroll may agree (such date, the "Closing Date"). As promptly as possible on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by MMC and Kroll and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 1.3. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. 1.4. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. The Certificate of Merger shall provide that at the Effective Time, (a) the Surviving Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior thereto in Merger Sub's Certificate of Incorporation, and (b) Merger Sub's Bylaws in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Surviving Corporation's Bylaws; in each case, until amended in accordance with the DGCL. 1.5. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Kroll shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 1.6. KROLL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Kroll shall, in accordance with Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 2.2(a)) and Kroll's Amended -2-
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Kroll Certificate") and Kroll's Amended and Restated Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Kroll Bylaws"), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of shares of Kroll Common Stock (the "Kroll Stockholders") to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "Kroll Stockholders Meeting"). Kroll shall ensure that the Kroll Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Kroll in connection with the Kroll Stockholders Meeting are solicited in material compliance with Applicable Laws, other than such non-compliance resulting from the failure of the representation set forth in Section 3.5 to be true and correct. (b) Kroll shall promptly prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") that meets in all material respects the requirements of Applicable Laws to seek the approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Kroll shall respond promptly to any comments made by the Commission with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary version thereof filed by it and shall cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Kroll Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable. Kroll shall promptly notify MMC of the receipt of any comments of the Commission with respect to the Proxy Statement and shall provide to MMC copies of any written comments received from the Commission in connection with the Proxy Statement. MMC shall be provided an opportunity to review and comment on all filings with the Commission, including the Proxy Statement, and all mailings to the Kroll Stockholders in connection with the Merger, and Kroll shall give reasonable consideration to all comments proposed by MMC. MMC shall promptly provide any information or responses to comments or other assistance reasonably requested by Kroll or the Commission in connection with the foregoing. (c) Subject to the following sentence, the Kroll Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 4.22) shall be included in the Proxy Statement and the Kroll Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Kroll Stockholders. In the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Kroll Board determines after consultation with outside counsel that its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law require it to withdraw, modify or qualify the Kroll Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to MMC, the Kroll Board may so withdraw, modify or qualify the Kroll Board Recommendation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Kroll Board may not recommend any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3(b)(viii)(A)) (other than this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger), except as specifically contemplated by, and in accordance with, Section 5.3(b)(iii); PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that unless this Agreement is theretofore terminated, Kroll shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the Kroll Stockholders for adoption at the Kroll Stockholders Meeting. 1.7. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Kroll or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, Kroll and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in -3-
law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of Kroll or otherwise to take any and all such action. ARTICLE II CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 2.1. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of MMC, Merger Sub or Kroll or their respective stockholders: (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding Surviving Corporation capital stock. (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of Kroll Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of Kroll Common Stock owned by MMC, Merger Sub or Kroll or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (which shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment being made with respect thereto) and any shares of Kroll Common Stock owned by stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262"), as provided in Section 2.1(d)) shall be converted into and represent the right to receive $37.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of Kroll Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(b) shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Kroll Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. (c) Each share of Kroll capital stock held in the treasury of Kroll automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of Kroll Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Kroll Stockholder that is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of shares of Kroll Common Stock pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 (the "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), but, instead, such Kroll Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws, each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Appraisal Shares, other than such rights -4-
as are granted by Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Kroll Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Kroll Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the rights of such Kroll Stockholder under Section 262 shall cease, and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b) without interest. Kroll shall give prompt notice to MMC of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Kroll Common Stock, and MMC shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Kroll shall not, without the prior written consent of MMC, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 2.2. SURRENDER AND PAYMENT. (a) PAYING AGENT; EXCHANGE FUND. Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Kroll Stockholders, MMC shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Kroll), a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to Kroll to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time (the "Paying Agent"). At the Effective Time, MMC shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (assuming no Appraisal Shares) upon surrender of such Certificates (such cash, the "Exchange Fund"). MMC shall be obligated to, from time to time, deposit any additional funds necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by MMC, on a daily basis. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income resulting from investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the Kroll Stockholders six months after the date of the mailing required by Section 2.2(b) shall be delivered to MMC, upon demand by MMC, and holders of Certificates that have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to MMC for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.3(d)), in each case, to the extent applicable (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), become the property of MMC, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall and MMC shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Kroll Stockholder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as MMC may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent -5-
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by MMC, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Kroll Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Kroll Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of Kroll, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 4.13(c)) required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of MMC that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. (c) STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Kroll shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Kroll Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. (d) NO LIABILITY. None of MMC, Merger Sub, Kroll or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (e) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by MMC or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as MMC or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration. (f) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN KROLL COMMON STOCK. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Kroll Common Stock represented thereby. (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and MMC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Kroll Stockholders such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving -6-
Corporation, MMC or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Kroll Stockholders in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, MMC or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 2.3. TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS; EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. (a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase a share of Kroll Common Stock (a "Kroll Option"), granted under the Kroll stock option plans in effect on the date of this Agreement, or otherwise, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested) shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive, from MMC or the Surviving Corporation, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event, no later than 10 days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of Kroll Common Stock subject to such Kroll Option; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, with respect to each Kroll Option issued under the 1996 Kroll Stock Option Plan (the "1996 Plan") to a participant therein (other than a participant entitled to reimbursement for the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code) (a "Participant"), which is subject to adjustment under Section 13.5 of the 1996 Plan (a "1996 Option"), the Committee administering the 1996 Plan will cause such 1996 Option to be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time, if such cancellation and conversion would reduce the payments for such Participant described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code below the threshold described in 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code, in which case such cancellation and conversion shall be effected to the extent necessary to reduce the payments for such Participant described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code to $10,000 (or such lower number as would be obtained if all the 1996 Options were so cancelled and converted) below the threshold described in 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code (by first canceling and converting the options which vest furthest from the Effective Time), or as otherwise agreed upon by Kroll, MMC, and such Participant, into the right to receive (a "Substitute Right"), in lieu of the payment described above, when vested in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such 1996 Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (based upon the vesting provisions of the 1996 Plan and the applicable option agreements), an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes), from MMC or the Surviving Corporation, equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of Kroll Common Stock subject to such 1996 Option, plus interest accrued thereon at an annual money market interest rate compounded quarterly for the period from the Effective Time through the vesting date of such 1996 Option; and provided, further that any Participant who receives Substitute Rights and whose employment is thereafter terminated by Kroll or its successors or affiliates without cause shall be entitled to payment for any unvested portion of such Substitute Rights upon such termination if the Participant would be better off after payment of all taxes (including the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code) by receiving such payment than by forfeiting such payment. In making any determinations pursuant to this Section 2.3(a), the Committee will take into account all payments to be made to such holder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will provide that MMC shall have the right to approve any such determination (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Prior to the Effective Time, Kroll shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.3(a), including amending the Kroll stock option plans. -7-
(b) Kroll shall take any and all actions with respect to Kroll's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") as are necessary to provide that (i) with respect to the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement, no employee who is not a participant in the ESPP as of the date hereof may become after the date hereof a participant in the ESPP and no participant in the ESPP may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date hereof for such Offering Period; (ii) subject to consummation of the Merger, the ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately before the Effective Time (the "Stock Plan Termination Date"); and (iii) if the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement terminates prior to the Stock Plan Termination Date, the ESPP shall be suspended and no new Offering Period will be commenced under the ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement. Subject to consummation of the Merger, if such Offering Period is still in effect on the Stock Plan Termination Date then on the Stock Plan Termination Date, each purchase right under the ESPP as of the Stock Plan Termination Date shall be automatically exercised by applying the payroll deductions of each participant in the ESPP for such Offering Period to the purchase of a number of whole shares of Kroll Common Stock (subject to the provisions of Kroll's ESPP regarding the number of shares purchasable) at an Exercise Price (as defined in the ESPP) per share equal to 85% of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) of a share of Kroll Common Stock on the Grant Date (as defined in the ESPP) or on the Stock Plan Termination Date, whichever is lower. (c) Kroll shall take any actions reasonably requested by MMC to effectuate the termination of the Kroll Options, it being understood that the intention of the parties is that following the Effective Time no holder of a Kroll Option or any participant in any Plan or other employee benefit arrangement of Kroll shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of Kroll or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, Kroll shall deliver to the holders of Kroll Options and participants in the ESPP appropriate notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to MMC, setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to this Agreement. 2.4. ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION. In the event that Kroll changes the number of shares of Kroll Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Kroll Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Kroll or any officer, director, key employee or Representative of Kroll or any of its subsidiaries acting on behalf of or at the direction of Kroll or any of its subsidiaries, or the Kroll Board from at any time prior to, but not after, the time this Agreement is adopted by the Kroll Stockholders at the Kroll Stockholders Meeting, (A) providing information in response to a request therefor by, or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with, a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is not made in violation of Section 5.3(b)(i) if the Kroll Board receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms no less favorable to Kroll than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2004, between Kroll and MMC (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); or (B) recommending such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Kroll Stockholders, if and only to the extent that, (1) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Kroll Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (2) in the case of clause (A) above, the Kroll Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors that it is reasonably likely that such Acquisition Proposal would result in a Superior Proposal; and (3) in the case of clause (B) above, the Kroll Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal (in the form, other than immaterial changes, that was the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice, as defined below) constitutes a Superior Proposal and MMC shall have received written notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") of Kroll's intention to take the action referred to in clause (B) at least three business days prior to the taking of such action by Kroll (the "Waiting Period"); PROVIDED, that the Kroll Board continues to believe, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by MMC after its receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice (with respect to which modifications Kroll and MMC shall endeavor to negotiate in good faith), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. If the Kroll Board recommends an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal pursuant to clause (B) above, MMC shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a) of the Agreement. -31-
(iv) Kroll agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(v) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Kroll shall promptly, orally notify MMC of any request for information or any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and Kroll shall provide to MMC written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 24 hours of such event. Kroll shall keep MMC informed orally on a reasonably current basis of the status of any Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been withdrawn or rejected and Kroll shall provide to MMC written notice of any such material developments within 24 hours. Kroll also agrees to provide any information to MMC that it is providing to another Person pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) at substantially the same time it provides such information to such other Person, unless MMC has already been provided such information. (vi) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(b) by any officer, director or key employee of Kroll or any of its subsidiaries or any Representative of Kroll or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of Kroll or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3(b) by Kroll. (vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Kroll Stockholders for the purpose of approving this Agreement and the Merger, regardless of the recommendation or any change in the recommendation of the Kroll Board with respect thereto. (viii) For purposes of this Agreement: (A) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect to (1) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving Kroll, (2) any purchase of an equity interest (including by means of a tender or exchange offer) representing an amount equal to or greater than a 15% voting or economic interest in Kroll, or (3) any purchase of assets, securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater than 15% of the consolidated assets of Kroll and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (including stock of the subsidiaries of Kroll). -32-
(B) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except that references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%") made by a Person other than a party hereto that is on terms that the Kroll Board (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside counsel) in good faith concludes, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal (including the timing of consummation) and the likelihood of obtaining financing and satisfying other conditions would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Kroll Stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. (c) THIRD PARTY STANDSTILL AGREEMENTS. Subject to Section 5.3(b)(iii)(A), during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement: (i) Kroll shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving MMC or its subsidiaries); and (ii) Kroll shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, the provisions of any such confidentiality or standstill agreements, including, if so requested by MMC and at MMC's expense, seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and seeking to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction. (d) ACCESS.

Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Kroll and its subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained by MMC in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by Kroll hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Kroll shall not be required to provide any information or access that it reasonably believes would violate Applicable Law, rules or regulations or the terms of any confidentiality obligation by which it is bound, or cause forfeiture of attorney/client privilege. (e) TERMINATION OF KROLL CREDIT AGREEMENT.

MMC, King Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MMC ("Merger Sub") and Kroll Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Kroll"), are, concurrently with execution of this Agreement, entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), providing for, among other things, a merger of Merger Sub with and into Kroll (the "Merger"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement. As a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, MMC has required that the Kroll Stockholders agree, and each Kroll Stockholder is willing to agree, to the matters set forth herein. In consideration of the foregoing, including the execution and delivery by MMC of the Merger Agreement, and the agreements set forth below, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. Each Kroll Stockholder represents, warrants and agrees that (a) he owns beneficially the number of shares of Kroll Common Stock set forth opposite such Kroll Stockholder's name on Schedule I (such shares, with respect to a particular Kroll Stockholder, the "Shares," it being understood that for purposes hereof "Shares" shall not be deemed to include shares a Kroll Stockholder is or will be entitled to receive upon exercise of any Kroll Option), (b) as of the date hereof, he owns the Shares, free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, security interests, encumbrances, voting agreements and commitments of every kind except for any liens, claims, understandings or arrangements that do not limit or impair the Kroll Stockholder's ability to perform his obligations under this Agreement, and (c) he has (on the date hereof) and will have (on the date of the Kroll Stockholders Meeting) sole voting and dispositive power over all of the Shares. 2. Each Kroll Stockholder agrees that it will not sell, pledge, assign, encumber or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of the Shares, or any interest therein, or securities convertible into, or any voting rights with respect to, any of the Shares, or enter into any contract with respect to any of the foregoing, other than (a) pursuant to the Merger or (b) a transfer to a Person who executes a counterpart of this letter agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to MMC, agreeing to be bound by the terms and provisions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Kroll Stockholder agrees that it will not grant any proxies or powers of attorney or enter into a voting agreement or other arrangement with respect to any Shares or deposit any Shares into a voting trust. 3. Each Kroll Stockholder agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted, all of the shares of capital stock of Kroll with respect to which it has the right to vote,
including the Shares, at any meeting of stockholders of Kroll (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), or pursuant to any action by written consent: (a) in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and any actions required in furtherance thereof; (b) against any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (c) against any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger). 4. Each Kroll Stockholder hereby grants to MMC a proxy to vote the Shares with respect to the matters specified in, and in accordance with the provisions of, paragraphs 3 of this Agreement. Each Kroll Stockholder agrees that this proxy shall be irrevocable until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 9 of this Agreement and coupled with an interest and will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by such Kroll Stockholder with respect to the Shares. 5. Subject to paragraph 10, each Kroll Stockholder agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any discussions or any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, an Acquisition Proposal, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal. Each Kroll Stockholder agrees to notify MMC as promptly as practicable of any inquiry, discussion or proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal after it becomes aware of such inquiry, discussion or proposal. 6. Without limiting the provisions of the Merger Agreement, in the event (a) of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or exchange of shares of capital stock of Kroll affecting any of the Shares, or (b) any Kroll Stockholder shall become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of capital stock of Kroll or other securities entitling the holder thereof to vote or give consent with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph 3 hereof, then the terms of this Agreement shall apply to such shares of capital stock or other securities of Kroll held by such Kroll Stockholder immediately following the effectiveness of the events described in clause (a) or such Kroll Stockholder becoming the beneficial owner thereof as described in clause (b), as though they were Shares of such Kroll Stockholder hereunder, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, after the date hereof, such Kroll Stockholder acquires shares of Kroll Common Stock by virtue of the exercise of a Kroll Option (such shares, acquired after the date hereof, "Option Shares") such Kroll Stockholder shall be permitted to sell such Option Shares on the open market for fair market value (less applicable commissions), PROVIDED, FURTHER, -2-
HOWEVER, that for so long as such Kroll Stockholder owns such Option Shares, the terms of this Agreement (including paragraphs 3 and 4) shall apply to such Option Shares as though they were Shares of such Kroll Stockholder hereunder.

Each Kroll Stockholder hereby waives any and all appraisal, dissenters or similar rights that it may have with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to the DGCL or other Applicable Law. 8.

This Agreement shall terminate upon the first to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. This Agreement may also be terminated, as to any Kroll Stockholder, by the mutual agreement of MMC and such Kroll Stockholder; PROVIDED, that such termination as to such Kroll Stockholder will not affect the obligations of any other Kroll Stockholder hereunder. No termination of this Agreement will relieve any party from liability for any material breach of its obligations hereunder committed prior to such termination. 10. The Kroll Stockholder does not make any agreement or understanding herein in the Kroll Stockholder's capacity as a director or officer of Kroll. The Kroll Stockholder executes this Agreement solely in his capacity as a stockholder of Kroll and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Kroll Stockholder in his capacity as an officer or director of Kroll or any of its subsidiaries. 11. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy which may be available at law or in equity. 12.

This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each party and such party's respective heirs, beneficiaries, executors, representatives and permitted assigns. 15. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 16. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to the provisions thereof relating to conflicts of law). 18. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Kroll Stockholders in this Agreement are made severally, and not jointly, by each Kroll Stockholder. 19. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, MMC and the Kroll Stockholders hereby agree that with respect to Stephen Forbes Cooper, Michael E.

We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and just re-prompt if you would like to ask a follow-up question. I'll now turn things over to Ms. Wijnberg. Please go ahead. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & Mclennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ---------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, everyone. As you know, yesterday we announced that MMC will acquire Kroll for $37 a share, or $1.9 billion. We anticipate closing the transaction in the third quarter. On the call this morning, we have Jeff Greenberg, Chairman and CEO of MMC. From Marsh, we have Ray Groves, CEO, Roger Egan, President, and Don Birdsong, who heads up Marsh's risk consulting services business.
From Kroll, we have Jules Kroll, Chairman, and Mike Cherkasky, CEO. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Sandra. Welcome, everybody. I'll speak briefly about the strategic and financial rationale for the deal, and after that, Mike will say a few words, and he'll be followed by Sandra to give additional financial information, and then we'll take your questions. To start out, we are very excited about this transaction. MMC is a unique company, and so is Kroll. What we see here is a combination of two growth businesses in risk services. It's a powerful strategic fit. The combination, we think, will accelerate the expansion of our risk services business, where we see growing client demand. So we believe that we'll be able to serve clients better, more effectively, through this combination. We see that demand growing globally. What we like about it is that it is really in our core business. So we see earnings growth and earnings diversification, two things from this transaction. Diversification is that these revenue streams are not correlated with the insurance cycle, and of course we expect it to contribute to growing shareholder value in MMC. In order to understand this deal, I need to give you some background for context. To start out, the mission of MMC's risk and insurance services business is to help clients to lower the total cost of risk to their enterprises. Traditional insurance broking plays a part, and so do other services. Now, we've been investing in risk-related services because we've been seeing growing demand from our clients and for a host of reasons that will be familiar to you. To name a few, post-9/11 security concerns that are global. Secondly, a host of new government regulations around the world, Sarbanes-Oxley, certainly well known here, BASIL 2 (ph), which affects banks, and a host of others. All of them have increased corporate accountability and a need for compliance. The third, corporate restructurings and bankruptcies and M&A activities have led to a need for more risk services over time, and we see that continuing. There's been a growing incidence of complex litigation and spreading around the world, which has also led to client demand for risk services. And in addition, the spillover effects of globalization, which have led to complexity and caused clients to have to deal with new risks they didn't contemplate before. Lastly, the whole issue of workforce quality, not only reflected in the insurance business in worker's compensation costs, but the emphasis on having a high-quality workforce, human capital and all of the issues that attend that in the way of risks and risks services that we've been dealing with and Kroll has been servicing as well. Ten years ago, Marsh's risk consulting and advisory business was less than 2% of our risk and insurance services revenues. At the end of last year, at the end of '03, those services represented about 15% of MMC's total risk-related revenues. Total risk-related revenue stakes in
all of Marsh, some small part of Mercer, and last year totaled about $7 billion. And about $1 billion of that $7 billion in revenues came from risk services. They've been growing well in the double digits, about 30% growth rates for the last several years, and we've been investing in them, and growing them both through internal efforts and through acquisitions. Kroll is simply the latest and the largest in a series of acquisitions to strengthen our position in risk services. Some of our acquisitions will have been familiar to you. Last year, we acquired Oliver Wyman. It's now part of Mercer. Oliver Wyman helps clients to understand their risks better. This includes valuing risks, analyzing risks, and therefore making decisions about how to handle them. They're specially strong with financial institutions. We also help clients to manage their risks better through collecting and handling data. Marsh has a first-class risk management information systems business, and about a month ago, we announced the acquisition of Corporate Systems, which is a claims management and reporting technology firm, to aid in the growth of that business to serve clients with additional skills that Corporate Systems brings to us. We've helped clients to avoid risks through screening and testing, and we've helped them to reduce risks after or before a risk event. A risk event could be a planned event, like an acquisition, or it could be an unplanned event - - it could be complex litigation, or it could be an insured loss or a loss of any kind, where clients seek mitigation capabilities that we've provided and in fact Kroll provides. Now, of course, all of these services complement Marsh's largest business, which is helping clients to structure risk management programs and to transfer risk. Now, turning to Kroll. The organization has four main businesses. Consulting services, which is their oldest lines of business, investigatory work, forensic work. Corporate advisory, which gets involved with corporate restructurings and bankruptcy. They are the only global player in that field. Background screening, which is screening of employees, mortgage screening as well, and technical services, which is a series of different businesses, e-mail document discovery, data recovery, both of which have been growing fields. Kroll employs about 3,200 people. They bring a very strong reputation. As we've come to see them, they're very talented leaders and staff. And we're experienced acquirers in professional services. We've made our share of acquisitions. We know how to judge professional orientation. We know how to judge professional quality and work for clients. And we see a very strong cultural fit between our two firms. They operate in 60 offices in 20 countries. They're especially strong in Europe, and we've been growing our own presence in Europe. That's an area where Mathus Calgulavetta (ph) has done especially good work, building on our strengths over the years, and we see a great fit in our European businesses.
The client roster that Kroll brings includes many in the Fortune 500, a vast majority of the top law firms, government work. Kroll's tripled in size since 2001 through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Many of the markets in which Kroll competes are growing rapidly, and they're highly fractured markets. So we see great opportunity for continued growth there. This year, Kroll's revenues should approach $700 million, which is a hefty growth rate over the last year. After the transaction closes, combined revenues from our consulting and services business will approximate 25% of our revenues in risk-related services, which includes all of Marsh and those parts of Mercer that offer risk services. We think that the combination of Marsh and Kroll will enable us to offer end-to-end risk mitigation services to our clients, for diagnostics and analytical tools, to post-event consulting and advisory services, and we think that this complement of services will continue to significantly differentiate our firm in the marketplace, within numerous areas where clients will welcome packages that combine the services of both firms. The acquisition of Kroll will also expand Marsh's capability in helping clients to process and manage information about risk. And we think that's a scalable business. It has been for us, has been for them, and has attractive economics to it. And we think it enhances our processing capabilities by adding background and vendor and credit screening services So it's the range of services that are now being offered. It's the combination that's now being offered that we think will both be valuable to clients. And we think that certainly we will serve clients better through the combination of the two firms and in areas that have high growth. Based on our own strategic and financial due diligence, we think that Kroll's rapid growth is going to continue and, in fact, is going to be enhanced as part of MMC. When we look at this strategic fit with Marsh and parts of Mercer, when we look at selected cost savings and potential revenue enhancements that we see, we think this transaction's going to be accretive in its first full year of operations. And I should add, I've been involved in our acquisitions since I rejoined the company in 1995. We tend to be pretty conservative around Marsh & McLennan. We typically under-promise and over-deliver. So the numbers that we're using today are numbers we're very comfortable with. This transaction plays to a core strength of MMC, which is that we create value for shareholders in addition to the other things we do, like successfully making and integrating acquisitions. And we look forward to completing this acquisition as quickly as possible and to delivering the benefits and to our shareholders. Now Mike is in L.A. This morning but he's on the call. And Mike, would you like to make a few comments? Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - -------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks, Jeff. I think Jeff has done a great job explaining the strategic rationale for the transaction, so we'll just have a few comments. They may be, actually, a little boringly consistent with what Jeff said, and maybe that's one of the great aspects of this deal, is that we look at the world the same way. First, the business idea of Kroll has been simple - to help solve risk-related problems for our clients. Today, those problems are more complicated, more global and more serious than ever before. We're convinced that the Kroll-MMC combination will provide our clients with an unprecedented breadth of risk-related solutions, and that's what they want. Second, we at Kroll are extremely proud of what we have accomplished over the last few years, and we were looking forward to a future of continued strong growth and improving operational metrics as a standalone company. But this opportunity came along, which was attractive for our shareholders because we believe MMC recognized the strength of our brand, our people, and the real and meaningful synergies that these two organizations can achieve together. We now believe Kroll's future inside MMC is even bigger and better. Reflecting that belief, the transaction was enthusiastically approved by our board of directors, which recommends that Kroll shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. Jules Kroll, I and several other members of the Kroll senior management team, together representing over 10% of the Kroll stock, are committed to vote in favor of the transaction. But I want to assure our tens of thousands of clients and our thousands of professional employees around the world that we would not be doing this transaction unless we absolutely had confidence that it would benefit our clients, our employees and our business. MMC does have a long history and a fine reputation for being an excellent owner of professional service firms. Marsh and Kroll, as Jeff says, are both industry leaders in the risk services business. We think that bringing together our respective businesses and capabilities makes tremendous sense. Our respective risk services are highly complementary in the ways that have been described. We are enthusiastically looking forward to becoming part of the Marsh organization. I do want to emphasize that as the press release indicates, Kroll will will continue to operate under the Kroll name and that I will continue to head and lead that organization in partnership with our new colleagues. Jules Kroll will be named a Vice Chairman of Marsh and will continue to be actively involved in setting the strategic direction of the Kroll business. And together, we and our new colleagues from Marsh will do what we at Kroll have been doing for 30 years, empowering clients to venture more securely in today's complex and risk-fraught business environments. Thank you, and I'm going to turn it over to Sandra Wijnberg.
Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Mike. I'll spend just a few minutes outlining the financial aspects of the transaction and then we'll open it up to your questions. The total purchase price of $1.9 billion, or $37 a share, includes all the share equivalents, underlying options, earn-outs, and assumes that all of Kroll's outstanding convertible notes, both the 6%, due '06, and the 1.75 due 2014 are exchanged for equity. We expect to close in the third quarter, and we expect to finance it with a combination of debt and cash from operations. We've already reviewed the deal and its impact on MMC with both rating agencies. Our strong balance sheet and coverage ratios provide a great deal of financial flexibility. When combined with the incremental cash flow generated by Kroll, our credit ratios are expected to be back in line within 12 months. Turning to the P&L, assuming one full quarter of results following completion of the transaction, Kroll will add about $165 to $175 million of revenues to our fourth quarter. We're currently estimating that after the acquisition-related cost and interest expense, the transaction will be neutral to our fourth-quarter EPS. In the first full year, which is 2005, we expect Kroll to contribute $800 to $850 million to our revenue base. From a reporting perspective, we'll combine Marsh Risk Consulting and services with Kroll under the risk and insurance services segment and disclose both according to underlying revenues, as is our tradition. We've already identified $30 million of annual efficiencies and cost saves. As we work on integration through the summer, we're confident we can achieve additional infrastructure and cost efficiencies to increase margins and profitability. The revenue benefits associated with combining our capabilities is at least as great as the savings, and will continue to grow. The acquired business quickly gets to a 20% margin, including synergies and acquisition cost. These costs are heavily skewed to the early years and include the amortization of intangibles and integration expenses. We believe on a longer-term basis we can operate the business with a margin in the mid-20s. We expect that after interest and taxes, the transaction will be accretive to our full-year 2005 earnings by two cents a share, and '06 earnings by about four cents a share. Our Kroll's businesses in total are expected to produce ongoing revenue growth in the mid teens, and the combination of our businesses together does nothing but support that growth and perhaps accelerate it. With Kroll's revenue growth and margin improvements, earnings accretion in future years should accelerate. If you compare the use of our balance sheet for this transaction to alternatives such as repurchasing our shares, the EPS accretion from this exceeds that of the debt-financed share repurchase beginning in 2006. And then it's obvious that the incremental cash flow from operations that we gain from growing our business contributes to our ability to invest back to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
With that, I'd like to turn to the conference operator to open up the lines for Q&A. And if you wouldn't mind, limit your questions this morning to our acquisition of Kroll. Thank you. Operator? QUESTION AND ANSWER ------------------- Operator - -------- Thank you, ma'am. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to signal to ask a question, you may do so by pressing the star key, followed by the digit one, on your touchtone telephone. If you are on a speakerphone, please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Once again, everyone, please press star, one at this time to signal for a question, and we'll pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to signal. And our first question today comes from Jay Cohen, Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch - Analyst - ------------------------------------ Yes, just one clarification. The cost savings you mentioned, Sandra, was that $30 million or $3 million? Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Thirty. Thirty million that we've identified so far. Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch - Analyst - ------------------------------------ That's what I thought I heard, OK. I guess the question I have is as far as kind of cross-selling goes, it seems that maybe the people out there at your client that are making these kind of buying decisions are different people, whether it's insurance or risk services. How have you found at Marsh the cross-selling to go between those types of businesses, and obviously do you think this will play out as far as cross-selling goes, given that you might have different people buying different products. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're going to ask Roger Egan, who is president of Marsh, to answer that question, Jay. Roger Egan - Marsh & Mclennan Companies - President Of Marsh, Inc. - -------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, I don't think we quite view it as cross-selling. We view it as combination as forming one kind of integrated offering. We have a collection of distinct risk practices and the way we operate our model is to have a client executive who is a generalist bring in specialists to meet the client needs. And the combination of the Marsh Risk Consulting practices and the Kroll risk mitigation practices just offers a broader range and combination of risk mitigation services. It's not quite cross-selling. It's a generalist who leads and brings specialists to the table. It's consistent with the model that we have right now. Kroll operates this way. Marsh operates this way. It's much more integrated than separate and distinct operations that cross-sell, as you've suggested. Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch - Analyst - ------------------------------------ That's great. Thanks, Roger. Operator - -------- We'll go next to Ron Frank, Smith Barney. Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- Yes, good morning. A couple of things. One is, clearly the senior management of Kroll, and I assume some key employees beyond them, are significant stockholders, and this is an all-cash deal, and I was wondering if you could discuss not even so much the top management, but perhaps how the next level of managers have been incented to remain committed to the combined organization. And second, Sandra, I was wondering if you could just clarify on the repurchase, I wanted to make sure I heard correctly that you felt that or had determined that the acquisition would be more accretive than debt-financed share repurchase starting in '06. Was that also applied to internally financed repurchase? Because clearly you'd be generating a fair amount of excess cash at that point and even not have to use debt. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- OK, let's have Sandra answer the second question first, and then we'll turn to Ray Groves, Chairman of Marsh, on the first question. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- When I was doing that analysis internally - way ahead of this transaction, by the way - I was assuming that when our capital structure got back to a normal level, we would be repurchasing it at the same pace. So, to answer your questions, the incremental debt applied to the transaction versus the speeding up our share repurchase program. Other than that, it's just base.
Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- Oh, I see. OK, so it's versus applying the debt used in the Kroll deal to repurchase as an alternative. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Yes, speeding up our share repurchase. Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- OK, speeding it up. OK, thank you. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- And now we'll ask Ray Groves, Chairman of Marsh, to talk about the management incentives in the Kroll organization. Ray Groves - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman of Marsh, Inc. - ------------------------------------------------------------------ Marsh and Kroll, including Mr. Kroll, have identified a large number of the key leaders and key rainmakers within their organization and we've entered into appropriate contracts with them with incentives to ensure their retention. Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- May I ask what the duration of those arrangements typically is? Ray Groves - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman of Marsh, Inc. - ------------------------------------------------------------------ Three and four years, respectively. Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- OK, and finally, Sandra, just one more - a request, really. I was wondering if you could add another slide to the presentation or in some way put out perhaps a cheat sheet for us with some of the key items of intangibles and restructuring cost and amortization that are in the assumptions just to help us with our models. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Yes, we're going to have to do that in some weeks, though, because we're working right now with the valuation agencies. There are different lives over which you amortize different kinds of intangibles, so we're working on that right now. Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- OK, thanks very much for all of that.
Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just one further comment on management of Kroll, I'll just reiterate we are experienced acquirers of professional services businesses, and we are used to bringing in new talented leaders and making them feel part of the company over a long term. Our record there is good, and we feel very comfortable with this team, led by Jules and Mike. Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - ------------------------------------------- And if I could just add, we're experienced acquirers, too, and the process that we've gone through with Marsh has been everything we would have in fact wanted to do. And I think that we're not going to have an issue going forward. We just don't anticipate - we've locked up some of the people that are important. We've got so many other people who in fact we've talked to and I think are enthusiastic about this deal. So we just don't anticipate a problem. Ron Frank - Smith Barney - Analyst - ----------------------------------- OK, great. Thanks again. Operator - -------- Our next question comes from Vinay Saqi, Morgan Stanley. Vinay Saqi - Morgan Stanley - Analyst - -------------------------------------- Good morning. Just a couple questions. One is if you could just clarify for us what the organic growth of Kroll has been. It seems as though there have been a lot of acquisitions over the last two years, and if we can get a sense of that. Second question is, will you be breaking out the margins for Kroll separately or the risk management segment separately from the regular brokerage businesses? Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sandra will answer the second question first and then we'll ask Mike Cherkasky to answer the organic growth question. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Just like the way in which we report, for example, the reinsurance business, Vinay, underneath the risk and insurance services segment, we will report Marsh Risk Consulting and Kroll combined together, but we will just report the underlying and reported revenue, and then we report the margins for the entire risk and insurance services segment. Vinay Saqi - Morgan Stanley - Analyst - -------------------------------------- OK.
Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike, do you want to? Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - ------------------------------------------- Sure. Last year, Kroll grew over 17% organically. We in fact had publicly stated that we expected to grow in revenues in the 12% to 15% range over the next three years. Our first quarter was substantially above that rate of growth. Over the last three years, almost half of our growth, which has been - - as Jeff indicated, we've tripled our revenues. Almost half of our growth has been organic. So we've had a combined program, which we have every intention of continuing, which is organic growth and to emphasize organic growth. At the same time, when appropriate and opportunistically, to continue to do acquisitions. Vinay Saqi - Morgan Stanley - Analyst - -------------------------------------- How sensitive is your business to the economy, if at all? Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - ------------------------------------------- We - I think Jeff, again, said it. We have the same philosophy of trying to make sure we have a mixed portfolio. You will find some of our businesses which have some sensitivity to employment in the economy, but the good news is we have other businesses which are counter-cyclical. So we have a - ask risk managers, we've run our business the same way we advise clients, to be cyclical, counter-cyclical and neutral business. Our big litigation business, for instance, in our electronic discovery, is obviously - people are suing people no matter whether it's a good economy or a bad economy. So what we've tried to do is be balanced and make sure that we're deeper in those businesses as that cycle comes into play. And because we're so international, it also, in fact, mitigates the cyclicality of any one economy. Vinay Saqi - Morgan Stanley - Analyst - -------------------------------------- All right, thank you. Operator - -------- Our next question will come from Tom Cholnoky with Goldman Sachs. Tom Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs - Analyst - --------------------------------------- Yes, good morning. First of all, just a quick comment Jeff and Sandra. Hopefully, you'll begin to use this forum of discussing or talking to the street in future quarters with respect to your results. I find this very helpful. Unidentified Speaker - --------------------
Was that your one question, Tom? Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- That was Mike (inaudible), for the record. Tom Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs - Analyst - --------------------------------------- But we'd also want to have Mike on the call as well. I guess I'm just a little bit curious once again in terms of how we should think about this acquisition in terms of ROEs. It seems as though Kroll obviously did have it looks like lower returns than Marsh overall, and why we shouldn't look at this as kind of a dilutive acquisition in terms of ROE. And maybe, Sandra, if you could walk that through, or am I missing something? Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- What you're missing is that you have a company as Mike Cherkasky just said that has done a lot of acquisitions, so you take on a lot of goodwill. And as you correctly, I think, pointed out in your research report, the return on tangible equity is a lot different than the return on book equity, right? Tom Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs - Analyst - --------------------------------------- Correct. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- I think you have that in your report there. Marsh & McLennan, on the other hand, hasn't done any materially large acquisitions for a number of years, so our return on equity is more at a steady state than theirs is. I think you have to look through the goodwill that they've taken on to grow their business. They have a good track record of doing acquisitions that are accretive immediately. And from an ROE perspective, we think that this is a business that long-term is just like ours. Tom Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs - Analyst - --------------------------------------- OK, but I shouldn't look at goodwill as invested capital? Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ---------------------------------------------------------- Return on invested capital is different than return on equity, but I'm happy offline to walk you through how we think about it. Tom Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs - Analyst - ---------------------------------------
OK, all right, terrific. I am only going to ask one question. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- If you want to talk about conference calls, we're happy to. It is something that as all of you know on the call, or most of you know on the call, we've talked about for quite some time. We are going to start doing earnings conference calls beginning with the second quarter. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Mike Bishoff (ph) will also participate. Operator - -------- And we'll go to our next question from Jeff Kessler with Lehman Brothers. Jeff Kessler - Lehman Brothers - Analyst - ----------------------------------------- Thank you. And congratulations, Mike and Jules. I'm really sorry to lose you guys. A quick question on any conflicts. And that is, does Kroll represent any competitors to MMC right now, and what happens if you do? Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just let me answer that. The obvious answer is that occasionally we will and do. What we've done is we've gone through their client list and our client list. We've looked at the significant clients that are meaningful to Kroll and where there might be issues, and we've found very, very small amounts of issues. And the issues, in comparison to what we think are the opportunities and the synergies is so far outweighed, Jeff, that it is not particularly troublesome. So, any time you put organizations together - any acquisition we do, one of the things we're doing is calculating the synergies and taking off those things that are non-synergistic or in fact will in fact not be able to be continued and come out with an equation. This one is so - is wildly in the positive side, Jeff. Jeff Kessler - Lehman Brothers - Analyst - ----------------------------------------- OK, thanks a lot, and again, congratulations. Operator - -------- Going next to John Balkind with Fox-Pitt Kelton. John Balkind - Fox-Pitt Kelton - Analyst - ----------------------------------------- Good morning, everyone. Just want to touch base on the revenue dynamics of the company. I didn't get a chance to look at the Kroll numbers in the first quarter in a lot of detail, but could you talk about where the incremental growth is coming form across the four segments in the first quarter, and then the rest of the year, and obviously you have a couple of businesses
that will be under pressure due to the economic or interest rate environment, and the differences in geography in terms of where the growth is coming from, because it's a pretty high growth rate that you're shooting for over time. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike, do you want to answer that? Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - ------------------------------------------- Sure. Of our four sectors, three of those sectors had very substantial growth rates, and we're talking substantial, double-digit growth, both quarter to quarter and certainly year to year, with the growth rates being in the 100% level for a year-to-year growth rate for our technology business, and almost 80% quarter to quarter in our screening business, for instance. And that little bit because the fourth quarter is a little seasonal. We expect to continue to have those very strong performances as our businesses - we get incremental revenue in our scaling business and our margin is produced and as we do more effective cross working with businesses that continue to be integrated into Kroll as fairly recent acquisitions. The one issue that we've had over the last year is a slowing of our - it's only in relative terms, of our bankruptcy restructuring business. That had a drop-off in domestically in the United States of something under 10% from a year ago in the first quarter. We expect that business to flatten for '04. We are getting signs that actually it may tick up a little bit in '05 because of some of the industry-specific as opposed to broad economic issues. But that is, in fact, even in that business is counterbalanced by what was a 20% quarter-to-quarter growth rate in our European restructuring business. So for us it's very, very strong first quarter, and a continuation of 10 quarters in a row for Kroll where we've had those kind of fundamental growth rates, which we absolutely had expected to continue as a standalone, and we are very confident that what we expected to do will actually be multiplied, being inside of the relationships and the business of Marsh. John Balkind - Fox-Pitt Kelton - Analyst - ----------------------------------------- Great. Thank you very much. Operator - -------- Our next question comes from Dave Sheusi with J.P. Morgan. Dave Sheusi - J.P. Morgan - Analyst - ------------------------------------ Yes, hey, good morning everyone. Can you hear me?
Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- We hear you fine. Dave Sheusi - J.P. Morgan - Analyst - ------------------------------------ Oh, good. Just a couple of questions around the structure of the deal. First, just wanted to get a sense of whether there was a collar surrounding the ultimate purchase price of the deal until ultimate closure. Is there a range where MMC would walk away, or is that part of the discussion, and then as of the purchase price, what was the percent of the earn out, and I guess how long is that earn-out? I didn't pick that up. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- OK, it's a cash - all-cash deal, so no collar applies. Dave Sheusi - J.P. Morgan - Analyst - ------------------------------------ OK. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- So the purchase price is $37 a share. And the earn-outs will all be disclosed in the proxy that's filed - I believe - I'm just looking at the General Counsel. I believe as with the earn-outs will all be disclosed in the proxy. Dave Sheusi - J.P. Morgan - Analyst - ------------------------------------ Great, congratulations. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. Dave Sheusi - J.P. Morgan - Analyst - ------------------------------------ Thank you. Operator - -------- And just a reminder for everyone on the phone lines. Star, one at this time if you would like to signal for a question.
We'll go next to Jeff Thompson, KBW, Incorporated. Jeff Thompson - KBW - Analyst - ------------------------------ Thanks. All my good questions have been asked, but I would follow up on one that Ron Frank asked on key personnel. It's noted in the 10-K of Kroll that three people, Cooper, France (ph) and I think it was Lobiando (ph) are key to the business, and I believe it's the corporate restructuring business. Are they on board for the next three to four years? Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike, would you like to answer this? Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - ------------------------------------------- Sure. They've signed extensions of their contracts, an additional 18 months of contracts so that now we have, from the date of - from May 18th, I think it's four years, plus a tail of two years non-compete. So they're on board. They're very enthusiastic. I talked to Steve Cooper last night after the deal. I think he wasn't quite as happy as Jules - it was Jules' birthday yesterday, but was really enthusiastic, because he sees the natural power of the relationships and the extensions of his business by being a part of a really great risk-consulting organization that Marsh and MMC is. So we talked extensively to the group already. We have had - people are always looking, where do I fit in? But certainly the leadership is excited and looking forward to many happy years inside of Kroll-Marsh. Jeff Thompson - KBW - Analyst - ------------------------------ Great, thank you. Operator - -------- Next up is Kevin Martin (ph), Credit Suisse First Boston. Kevin Martin - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst - ---------------------------------------------------- Yes, hello. Can you provide more information on the background about what led to this transaction, and was it - what are the other opportunities you looked at? Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, Kroll is a unique company, and we didn't do a screen of all of Kroll's competitors because there isn't another Kroll organization. But we do know the field pretty well and know what the competitive set looks like. But it was - the background was that I placed a call to Jules, who I've known for a number of years, and suggested that we might want to consider a possible business combination if they were ever interested.
He thought about it for a few weeks, called me back. This was earlier this year. Our organizations began talking, and as we began to continue to see that a fit could be very good for our clients and employees and shareholders, discussions intensified. So that's the background. Kevin Martin - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst - ---------------------------------------------------- So there wasn't any competing offers on the table from other... Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- For Kroll, he means. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Oh, for Kroll. Well, I'd leave that for Mike or Jules to answer. Mike Cherkasky - Kroll - President and CEO - ------------------------------------------- The brief answer is that our board obviously went through the processes of consideration, the appropriate processes. And at the end of the day, because of the uniqueness of what we saw here and the value that in fact we were being offered, and with advice of obviously counsel and bankers, maybe too many bankers, made the determination that this was something that really we didn't think we could duplicate for our shareholders and obviously move forward with this deal. Kevin Martin - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst - ---------------------------------------------------- OK, can you also provide more details in terms of approvals apart from shareholder and HSR (ph). Was anything else requiring approval? And also, just some more deals on this earn-out. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, we're not aware of any other approvals that are required, as we have stated in the press release, and the details of the earn-out will be provided in the proxy. Kevin Martin - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst - ---------------------------------------------------- OK, thanks very much. Operator - -------- We'll now go to Tom Barr (ph), Lundbern Harden (ph). Eric Goldsman - Lundbern Harden - Analyst - ------------------------------------------ Hi, this is Eric Goldsman (ph) with Tom Barr (ph). Sandra, this is a question with respect to the profitability. You had mentioned that the target would be getting into the mid 20s. Could you talk a little bit about that, just in terms of how that might come, given I guess maybe
the nature of Kroll's profitability and maybe some of the ways that Kroll's profitability and Marsh Mac's profitability will come together to become a little more accretive? Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Well, a big item that we'll lay out for you in more detail as we understand it a lot better is the fact that the amortization of intangibles and integration costs is very heavily in the early years. That's point one. Point two is, if you've been a student of Kroll's businesses, you'll see that the businesses that are the most rapidly growing are also getting the benefits of scale. And so they are naturally - their organic margins are expanding as well. And so we are bringing them in at a time in which their margins just naturally are expanding. Thirdly, we see a lot of efficiencies, not just in initial cost saves, but also putting them on our platforms in terms of driving their profitability closer to ours. And, obviously, leveraging our distribution, the Marsh distribution, which reduces the cost of client acquisitions, if you think about that. You don't get paid for marketing time, you get paid for doing things. Unidentified Speaker - -------------------- Just to reiterate and to make sure you understand, Kroll expects to come out of this year at a run rate of 19.5, which is a couple of points above last year, and in fact it's said publicly that we expect to be closely 20% by '06. And when you take into account the things that Sandra says, we think that the mid 20s is something that possibly couldn't be achieved by Kroll standalone, but certainly can be done inside of this organization. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger Egan is going to add one more element to that. Roger Egan - Marsh & McLennan Companies - President of Marsh, Inc. - ------------------------------------------------------------------- I'd just like to add that Marsh has a very powerful distribution network. We're talking about a global network of over 400 offices. We're talking about 38,000 colleagues. We're talking about thousands of client executives, and this will be available to all of the Kroll risk practices and will just be a great positive to offering these services to a broad array of clients. Eric Goldsman - Lundbern Harden - Analyst - ------------------------------------------ All right, great. Thank you all. That was very helpful. Operator - -------- We'll now go to Bill Warmington with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Bill Warmington - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst - -------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the acquisition. I wanted to see if I could re-ask that last question a little differently and asking that, given the level of margin improvement that you're looking to achieve, the question is, how do you do that, given that you have the U.S. restructuring business for Kroll, which has been the highest-margin business looking at a pretty significant deceleration from over the next couple of years. And, also included in the '04 numbers are about $20 million worth of one-time success fees that carry about an 85% operating margin in it. Unidentified Speaker - -------------------- I think, Bill, that we've set out that we expect margin to come down in our restructuring business. And we would expect that the successes next year will continue - however continue to be between 15% and 20%. So it's - there is some pressure in the margin there. We, in our own standalone projections, had certainly understood it and said that we were going to get into the 20s. I think you've seen an enormous shift by Kroll over the last year from a business that had roughly 65% of our operating profit in the first quarter of last year was from our CARG (ph) operations to this quarter, first quarter of '04, roughly 33% was from CARG (ph). So you've seen the shift occur already. I think it has had some impact on our margin, as has large revenues that are not very productive in Iraq because of certain startup and pass through. I think you'll see that all become normalized, and we're confident that, as Sandra said, our incremental revenues that are going into our scalable businesses. And as Roger says, the ability to sell through a whole host - I don't want to call it an army, but a host of people who have relationships, we are quite confident that that's going to allow us to move those margins into the mid 20s in short order. Bill Warmington - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst - ------------------------------------------------------- Well, thank you, and again, congratulations on the acquisition. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. Operator - -------- And due to time constraints, we'll cover two more questions before turning the call back over to the speakers. We'll go next to Tom Walsh, Lehman Brothers. Tom Walsh - Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------- Hey, guys, good morning. Just wondering if you could elaborate a little more on the breakdown between cash and incremental debt in the transaction and where that might be
taking your financial leverage? And I think you'd mentioned your coverage ratios would be coming back in line fairly quickly. I was wondering what promises you might have made to the rating agencies, or at least your own corporate goals. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- OK, the combination of debt and cash, really, is something that we'll determine as we get a little bit closer to the end of the year - or to the closing of the transaction. The way we presented it to the rating agencies right now is all debt. So from the perspective of talking to them, we've been very conservative about those assumptions. When we talk about getting our ratios back in line, we're talking about a whole host of ratios, including EBITDA coverage, retained cash flow to total debt, as well as debt to total capital. If you take the one that is the easiest one for everybody to calculate, which is debt to total capital, it gets back to where we are today within a year. Tom Walsh - Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------- Great. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- Does that answer your question? Tom Walsh - Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------- Yes, thank you very much. Sandra Wijnberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - SVP and CFO - ----------------------------------------------------------- The other ratios correct faster. Tom Walsh - Lehman Brothers - Analyst - -------------------------------------- Understand. Thank you. Operator - -------- And next up is Paul Carter, Wachovia Securities. Paul Carter - Wachovia Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------- Yes, hi, this is Paul Carter for Mark Markon. I thought in your prepared remarks you touched on about - you made some comments around leveraging data, and I think this is in reference to Corporate Systems and (inaudible), particularly around background vendor and credit screening. I'm wondering if you can add
any additional color on how this acquisition adds significantly to your capabilities and where your opportunities in reference to kind of data-driven risk-management services? Thank you. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Don, do you want to answer that? Don Birdsong - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Risk Consulting Services - --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Over the last five years, Marsh has been growing our presence in the data management area in risk management services, and as you all are aware, we acquired recently Corporate Systems, which was going to double our presence in that business. The addition of the background screening business and the technology services group of Kroll will have this new company at about 40% of total revenues in the scalable businesses, all around helping our clients manage risk, risk processing, and manage information more effectively. The margins on our business have grown to in excess of 25%, and we see that continuing into the future. Paul Carter - Wachovia Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------- Are there any additional services that you'd like to add in that area that perhaps Kroll kind of gives you a lead into? Don Birdsong - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Risk Consulting Services - --------------------------------------------------------------------- I could probably go on for about an hour in providing you the list of opportunities that we see in taking the scalable side of the business and enhancing it for our customers. But to give you one example, you take a look at the background screening business and the ability to connect to our workforce strategies group where we deal with worker's compensation issues for our clients in Mercer, on the human resources side, in Marsh's employee benefits side. A great opportunity to leverage that side of the business very effectively. On the Kroll technology services business, which predominantly does three things - providing data recovery for loss of media, providing electronic evidence discovery, and also providing computer forensics. Those resources around Marsh's claim activity on our claims consulting business we think are going to provide tremendous leverage for our firm as well as tremendous capability for our clients. Paul Carter - Wachovia Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------- OK, OK. And just as a point of clarification, what I was trying to get at is obviously Kroll's into background screening. I'm wondering if there's other data-type driven screen-
ing processes, such as tenant screening, et cetera, that maybe Kroll or Marsh will want to move into. Unidentified Speaker - -------------------- We already do it. But I think - I agree with Don. It does open up now a whole series of opportunities because we have the technology to provide data and analyze that data quickly for Marsh type of clients. The question is, what do you do with it? We've found some uses. I think we're going to find more as we continue to talk. Unidentified Speaker - -------------------- And the ability to give our clients quicker, faster information around risk and the decision process of retaining and managing risk is really our goal. Paul Carter - Wachovia Securities - Analyst - -------------------------------------------- All right, thank you. Jeff Greenberg - Marsh & McLennan Companies - Chairman, President and CEO - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I hope that through our presentation and through the answers that we've provided to your questions that you can understand why we are all so enthusiastic about this transaction. We have two unique firms in high-growth businesses, a tremendous strategic fit and a cultural fit, which we think is really going to be great for our clients and our employees and our shareholders. So thank you for your questions, and we'll obviously be continuing our conversations with you as you have new questions. Thanks a lot. Operator - -------- Thank you. Once again, everyone, that does conclude today's teleconference. We do appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at this time.
