ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 -------------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. On June 9, 2004, MMC reached a final settlement of the previously disclosed arbitration proceeding with Lawrence J. Lasser, former president and chief executive officer of Putnam Investments. The settlement represents approximately $25 million less than the company had accrued for compensation expense for Mr. Lasser in prior years. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Lasser will receive a cash payment in full settlement of all outstanding issues related to his employment, compensation, and departure from the company. This cash payment represents the release of fully vested amounts previously awarded to Mr. Lasser over the past decade ($55 million) and a portion (approximately $23 million) of amounts previously awarded but not fully vested. The settlement is not expected to have a significant impact on Putnam's second quarter results when combined with costs associated with other executives who have left Putnam.
