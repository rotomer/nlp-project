Section 8--Other Events Item 8.01. Other Events. In a previous filing, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC") reported that it had entered into letter agreements ("Waiver Agreements") with the banks party to its four outstanding credit agreements (the "Credit Agreements"), to waive until December 30, 2004 the effects of matters raised by the complaint filed by the Attorney General of the State of New York on October 14, 2004. The Credit Agreements and Waiver Agreements are attached to this Report as exhibits. INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("MMC") and their representatives may from time to time make verbal or written statements (including certain statements contained in this report and other MMC filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our reports to stockholders) relating to future results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, discussions concerning revenues, expenses, earnings, cash flow, capital structure, pension funding, the adverse consequences arising from market-timing issues at Putnam, including fines and restitution, the complaint filed by the New York State Attorney General's Office stating a claim for, among other things, fraud and violations of New York State antitrust and securities laws, as well as market and industry conditions, premium rates, financial markets, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, contingencies, and matters relating to MMC's operations and income taxes. Such forward-looking statements are based on available current market and industry materials, experts' reports and opinions, and long-term trends, as well as management's expectations concerning future events impacting MMC. Forward-looking statements by their very nature involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements contained herein include, in the case of MMC's risk and insurance services business, changes in competitive conditions, the impact of litigation concerning the claims brought by the New York State Attorney General's Office, movements in premium rate levels, the continuation of difficult conditions for the transfer of commercial risk and other changes in the global property and casualty insurance markets, natural catastrophes, mergers between client organizations, and insurance or reinsurance company insolvencies. Factors to be considered in the case of MMC's investment management business include changes in worldwide and national equity and fixed income markets, actual and relative investment performance, the level of sales and redemptions, and the ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at historic levels; and with respect to all of MMC's activities, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, changes in general worldwide and national economic conditions, the impact of terrorist attacks, changes in the value of investments made in individual companies and investment funds, fluctuations in foreign currencies, actions of competitors or regulators, changes in interest rates or in the ability to access financial markets,
developments relating to claims, lawsuits and contingencies, prospective and retrospective changes in the tax or accounting treatment of MMC's operations, and the impact of tax and other legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which MMC operates. In addition, there are risks and uncertainties relating to MMC's ability to integrate Kroll's business successfully and realize expected synergies; the continued strength of Kroll's relationships with its employees, suppliers, and customers; and the accuracy of the basis for the forecasts related to Kroll's business. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and MMC undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. MMC is committed to providing timely and materially accurate information to the investing public, consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations. To that end, MMC and its operating companies use their websites to convey meaningful information about their businesses, including the anticipated release of quarterly financial results and the posting of updates of assets under management at Putnam. Monthly updates of total assets under management at Putnam will be posted to the MMC website the first business day following the end of each month. Putnam posts mutual fund and performance data to its website regularly. Assets for most Putnam retail mutual funds are posted approximately two weeks after each month-end. Mutual fund net asset value (NAV) is posted daily. Historical performance and Lipper rankings are also provided. Investors can link to MMC and its operating company websites through www.mmc.com.

Section 1.3 Types of Borrowings. The term "Borrowing" denotes the aggregation of Loans of one or more Banks to be made pursuant to Article 2 on a single date and for a single Interest Period.

Borrowings are classified for purposes of this Agreement either by reference to the pricing of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a "Fixed Rate Borrowing" is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing or a Money Market Borrowing (excluding any such Borrowing consisting of Money Market LIBOR Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.1), and a "Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of Euro-Dollar Loans) or by reference to the provisions of Article 2 under which participation therein is determined (i.e., a "Committed Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.1 in which all Banks participate in proportion to their Commitments, while a "Money Market Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.3 in which the Bank participants are determined on the basis of their bids in accordance therewith). ARTICLE 2 THE CREDITS ----------- Section 2.1 Commitments to Lend. During the Revolving Credit Period, each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make loans to the Borrower pursuant to this Section from time to time in amounts such that the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans by such Bank at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the amount of its Commitment. Each Borrowing of Committed Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of (x) in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, $5,000,000 and (y) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, $10,000,000 or, in either case, any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount available in accordance with Section 3.2) and shall be made from the several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow under this Section, repay, or to the extent permitted by Section 2.11, prepay Loans and reborrow under this Section at any time during the Revolving Credit Period and, subject to Section 2.11, Convert and Continue Committed Loans at any time during the Revolving Credit Period; provided that no more than eight (8) separate Interest Periods in respect of Euro-Dollar Loans from each Bank may be outstanding at any one time and the limitations set forth in Section 2.3(a)(i) shall be applicable. 11
Section 2.2 Notice of Committed Borrowing. (a) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (a "Notice of Committed Borrowing") not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the date of each Base Rate Borrowing and (y) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying: (i) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic Business Day in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing; (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing; (iii) whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans; and (iv) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period. Section 2.3 Money Market Borrowings. (a) The Money Market Option. In addition to Committed Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.1, the Borrower may, as set forth in this Section, request the Banks during the Revolving Credit Period to make offers to make Money Market Loans to the Borrower. The Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section, provided that: (i) there may be no more than eighteen (18) different Interest Periods for both Euro-Dollar Loans and Money Market Loans outstanding at the same time (for which purpose Interest Periods described in different numbered clauses of the definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous); and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of all Committed Loans, at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. (b) Money Market Quote Request. When the Borrower wishes to request offers to make Money Market Loans under this Section, it shall transmit to the Administrative Agent by facsimile a Money Market Quote Request substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto ("Money Market Quote Request") so as to be received not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the fifth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the Domestic Business Day next preceding the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective) specifying: 12
(i) the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall be a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a LIBOR Auction or a Domestic Business Day in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period, and (iv) whether the Money Market Quotes requested are to set forth a Money Market Margin or a Money Market Absolute Rate. The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for more than one Interest Period in a single Money Market Quote Request. No Money Market Quote Request shall be given within five Euro-Dollar Business Days (or such other number of days as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) of any other Money Market Quote Request. (c) Invitation for Money Market Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of a Money Market Quote Request, the Administrative Agent shall send to the Banks by facsimile an Invitation for Money Market Quotes substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto ("Invitation for Money Market Quote"), which shall constitute an invitation by the Borrower to each Bank to submit Money Market Quotes offering to make the Money Market Loans to which such Money Market Quote Request relates in accordance with this Section. (d) Submission and Contents of Money Market Quotes. (i) Each Bank may submit a Money Market Quote containing an offer or offers to make Money Market Loans in response to any Invitation for Money Market Quotes. Each Money Market Quote must comply with the requirements of this subsection (d) and must be submitted to the Administrative Agent by facsimile at its offices specified in or pursuant to Section 9.1 not later than (x) 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the fourth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective); provided that Money Market Quotes submitted by the Administrative Agent (or any affiliate of the Administrative Agent) in its capacity as a Bank may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if the Administrative Agent or such affiliate notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer or offers contained therein not later than (x) one hour prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 15 minutes prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction. Subject to Articles 3 and 6, any Money Market Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower. (ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify: 13
(A) the proposed date of Borrowing, (B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (x) must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (y) may not exceed the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers were requested and (z) may be subject to an aggregate limitation as to the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers being made by such quoting Bank may be accepted, (C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (the "Money Market Margin") offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted from such base rate, (D) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market Absolute Rate") offered for each such Money Market Loan, and (E) the identity of the quoting Bank. A Money Market Quote may set forth up to three separate offers by the quoting Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation for Money Market Quotes. (iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it: (A) is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto or does not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii); (B) except as provided in Section 2.3(d)(ii)(B)(z), contains qualifying, conditional or similar language; (C) except as provided in Section 2.3(d)(ii)(B)(z), proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or (D) arrives after the time set forth in subsection d(i). (e) Notice to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money 14
Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted. (f) Acceptance and Notice by the Borrower. Not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to subsection (e) In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request; (ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000; (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. (g) Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (h) Commitment Utilization. Except for purposes of Section 3.2(c) and for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated in Section 2.9(ii), the amount of any Money Market Loan made by any Bank shall not constitute a use of such Bank's Commitment. Section 2.4 Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. 15
(b) Not later than 12:00 Noon (or 1:00 P.M., in the case of a same day Base Rate Borrowing) (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation), each Bank participating therein shall make available its share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent for account of the Borrower, at account number 323-5-09118 maintained by the Administrative Agent with JPMCB at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Banks in writing). Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower maintained by it with JPMCB at the aforesaid address. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation) that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.7 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. Section 2.5 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Commitments or its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a promissory note forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits G-1 and G-2, in an amount equal to its Commitments or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans, as the case may be. In such event, the Borrower, at its costs, shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). Each such promissory note shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the requesting Bank, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require. 16
(b) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and the type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Banks and each Bank's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 2.6 Maturity of Loans; Rollover Conversions. (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank the entire outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans of such Bank, and each Committed Loan shall mature, on the Termination Date. (b) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank that makes any Money Market Loan the principal amount of such Money Market Loan, and such Money Market Loan shall mature, on the last day of the Interest Period for such Money Market Loan. (c) In the case of any Committed Loan, if the Borrower shall not have given a timely notice prior to the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan for either (i) a Borrowing in a principal amount at least equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period or (ii) a payment or prepayment of the entire amount of such Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period, then, automatically and without further action, such Loan (or relevant portion thereof) will be Converted into, or Continued as, as the case may be, a Base Rate Loan, and a Base Rate Borrowing shall be effected on the last day of such Interest Period in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan not subject to a Borrowing and/or payment/prepayment. Section 2.7 Interest Rates. (a) Base Rate Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Base Rate Loan of such Bank, for each day from the date such Loan is made, Continued or Converted into a Base Rate Loan until it is paid, prepaid, becomes due or is Converted into a Loan of a different type at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate Margin for such day plus the Base Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on 17
the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment or prepayment thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type). (b) Euro-Dollar Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment, prepayment or Continuation thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type) and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage. The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate Service (or on any successor or substitute page of such Service, or any successor to or substitute for such Service, providing rate quotations comparable to those currently provided on such page of such Service, as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in the London interbank market) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period, as the rate for dollar deposits with a maturity comparable to such Interest Period. "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion Dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (as such term is used in Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United States residents). The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage. (c) Money Market Loans. Subject to Section 8.1, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Money Market LIBOR Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section 2.7(b) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the 18
outstanding principal amount of each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. Interest on each Money Market Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than (x) 90 days, in the case of any Money Market Absolute Rate Loan or (y) three months, in the case of any Money Market LIBOR Loan, at intervals of 90 days or three months, respectively, after the first day thereof. (d) Post Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest at the applicable Post-Default Rate on any principal of any Loan of such Bank, and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Bank to or for account of such Bank, which shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), for the period from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date the same is paid in full. Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand. (e) Determinations. The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Section 2.8 Facility Fees. (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with the Pricing Schedule). Such facility fee shall accrue for each Bank (i) from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety, on the daily amount of such Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety to but excluding the date such Bank's Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Loans. (b) Accrued facility fees under this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and on the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety). Section 2.9 Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. During the Revolving Credit Period, the Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Banks upon receipt of such notice), (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time, (ii) reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 the aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (for which purpose use of the Commitments shall be deemed to include the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans) or (iii) reduce from time to time the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an amount such that the aggregate amount of the Commitments (after taking into account such reduction) equals the aggregate outstanding 19
principal amount of the Loans. The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be reinstated. Section 2.10 Scheduled Termination of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and the Borrower hereby promises to pay any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) on such date. Section 2.11 Optional Payments, Prepayments, Conversions and Continuations. (a) Subject in the case of any Fixed Rate Loans to Section 2.13, the Borrower may, (i) upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. on the same day, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any Money Market Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.1) or (ii) upon at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in part, in amounts aggregating $20,000,000 or any larger multiple of $10,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan, pay such Loan on such day in whole or in part by paying the principal amount to be paid together with accrued interest thereon.

Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower in writing). If the due date of any payment under this Agreement would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Domestic Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (c) The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank, specify to the Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the Banks for application in such manner as it or the Required Banks, subject to Section 2.15, may determine to be appropriate). (d) Each payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank shall be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds, for account of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made. Section 2.13 Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails to borrow, prepay, Convert into or Continue any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.4(a) or 2.11(d), or the Borrower Converts or Continues any Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment, failure to borrow, prepay, Convert or Continue or Conversion or Continuation, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a written request as to the amount of such loss or expense, which written request shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Continued, Converted or not borrowed, Converted or Continued for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, failure to borrow, Convert or Continue, Conversion or Continuation to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a 21
failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing, Conversion or Continuation) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein (excluding loss of margin) over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market (if such Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan or a Money Market LIBOR Loan) or the United States secondary certificate of deposit market (if such Loan is a Money Market Absolute Rate Loan) for Dollar deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such Bank). Section 2.14 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Section 2.15 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing and Continuation of, and each Conversion into, Committed Loans from the Banks under Section 2.1 shall be made from or by, as the case may be, the Banks, each payment of a facility fee under Section 2.8 shall be made for account of the Banks, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.9 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Banks, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) the making and Continuation of, and Conversion into, Committed Loans shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Committed Loans held by them, provided that if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any Committed Loan the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans shall not be held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made (by reason of a failure of a Bank to make a Loan hereunder in the circumstances described in the last paragraph of Section 9.5), then such payment shall be applied to the Committed Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans being held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments; and (d) each payment of interest on Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the Banks. Section 2.16 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made, Continued or Converted by each Bank shall be made, Continued, Converted and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such type. Section 2.17 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank, and no Bank shall have any obligation to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank for the failure by such Bank to make any Loan required to be made by such Bank. The amounts 22
payable by the Borrower at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Administrative Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes.

Section 6.2 Notice of Default by Banks. Each Bank shall give notice to the Administrative Agent and each other Bank promptly after such Bank obtains knowledge that a Default has occurred under Section 6.1(a) with respect to such Bank's Money Market Loans. ARTICLE 7 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ------------------------ Section 7.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes JPMCB to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Section 7.2 Administrative Agent and Affiliates. JPMCB shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and JPMCB and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent and JPMCB and its affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks. Except with respect to information furnished to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by JPMCB or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Section 7.3 Action by Administrative Agent. The obligations of the Administrative Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein, and the Administrative Agent shall not by reason of this Agreement be a trustee for any Bank. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action with respect to any Default, except as expressly provided in Article 6. Section 7.4 Consultation with Experts; Sub-Agent. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance 34
with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions contained in the Article 7 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Section 7.5 Liability of Administrative Agent. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks (or each Bank, if applicable) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 3, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith.

Section 7.6 Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with its Commitment (and, after the Commitments have been terminated, ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by such Bank), indemnify the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, judgment, suit, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder. Section 7.7 Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under this Agreement. Section 7.8 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, 35
subject, so long as no Event of Default shall be continuing, to the approval of such successor Administrative Agent by the Borrower. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and approved by the Borrower, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and which is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent. Section 7.9 Administrative Agent's Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Such fees once paid shall be non-refundable. ARTICLE 8 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES ----------------------- Section 8.1 Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "London Interbank Offered Rate" in Section 2.7 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for Fixed Rate Loans as provided herein; or (b) in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. During any such suspension unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow, Continue or Convert, as the case may be, on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made or Continued 36
as, or Converted into, a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day. Section 8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain, fund, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank into a Base Rate Loan from such Bank in an equal principal amount (on which Loan interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks). Section 8.3 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make, Continue or Convert Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make, Continue or Convert into Fixed Rate Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, maintaining, Continuing or Converting into any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any Note that relates to Fixed Rate 37
Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction which arise out of its Loans or any Notes. (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for the portion of such reduction attributable to its Loans or any Notes. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.3 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 8.4 Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.4, the following terms have the following meanings: "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Bank, (x) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (y) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payment solely as a result of a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office made other than pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4(f). 38
"Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp, mortgage recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, the enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. (b) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower, shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and as required thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service Form W8-BEN or W8-IMY or W-ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts such Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. (e) For any period with respect to which a Bank required to do so has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure, if required, to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower 39
shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes. (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 8.5 Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.3(a) or 8.4 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks); and (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- Section 9.1 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a) in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Bank, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (c) in the case of any party, such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section 9.1 and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section 9.1; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until received. Notices and other communications to the Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article 2 or any notices related 40
to Borrowings, payments or repayments unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Bank. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Section 9.2 No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 9.3 Expenses; Indemnification; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including (without duplication) the fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom. (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. Section 9.4 Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise (other than a repayment or prepayment by the Borrower made in accordance with its obligations hereunder), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such 41
payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Section 9.5 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that (a) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder or for the termination of the Commitments, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.5 or any other provision of this Agreement, or (v) amend or modify Section 9.6(a) and (b) any modification or supplement of Article 7 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at a time when the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3 to make any Committed Loan hereunder are, in the reasonable opinion of the Required Banks, satisfied, any Bank shall fail to fulfill its obligations to make such Loan then, for so long as such failure shall continue, such Bank shall (unless the Required Banks, determined as if such Bank were not a "Bank" hereunder, shall otherwise consent in writing) be deemed for all purposes relating to amendments, modifications, waivers or consents under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under this Section 9.5) to have no Loans or Commitments, shall not be treated as a "Bank" hereunder when performing the computation of Required Banks and shall have no rights under the preceding paragraph of this Section 9.5; provided that any action taken by the other Banks with respect to the matters referred to in clause (a) of the preceding paragraph shall not be effective as against such Bank. Section 9.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. (b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall 42
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.5 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees, subject to subsection (e) below, that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $5,000,000) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the written consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld and the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that, so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; provided further that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required; and provided further that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Money Market Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to fund such Loan 43
pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrower may bring any proceeding against the Granting Bank or the SPC in order to enforce any rights of the Borrower hereunder. The funding of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Bank provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Bank, all or any part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. (d) Any Bank may (without notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and without payment of any fee) at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder. (e) No Assignee, Participant, SPC or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. Section 9.7 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Note or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Section 9.8 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement and any Notes issued hereunder constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the 44
Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of a facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). Section 9.9 Waiver Of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER AND EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Section 9.10 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.13, 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3, and the obligations of the Banks under Section 7.6 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section and to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to any Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section by another party hereto or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. * * * 45

EXHIBIT 10.2 WAIVER LETTER (Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 13, 2002) October 17, 2004 To the Banks party to the Credit Agreement referenced below and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. Ladies and Gentlemen: Reference is made to the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 13, 2002 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Credit Agreement"), among Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the "Borrower"), the banks and other financial institutions party thereto (the "Banks"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. As you have been advised, the Attorney General of the State of New York has filed a civil complaint against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. (a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Borrower) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York on October 14, 2004 (the "Complaint"). The Complaint alleges that the Borrower and Marsh Inc. have failed to comply with law, which noncompliance may, if found to be true, (i) result in judgments against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. that may have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole and (ii) have a material adverse effect upon the business, financial position, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. Accordingly, the matters raised by the Complaint may prohibit the Borrower from borrowing a Loan under the Credit Agreement as a result of (x) an inability by the Borrower to bring-down the representation in Section 4.5 [Litigation] of the Credit Agreement and (y) a potential Default under Section 5.3 [Compliance with Laws; Borrowing Authorization] or 6.1(d) [Misrepresentation Default] of the Credit Agreement. As contemplated by Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower desires the Banks to agree that: (A) the Complaint shall not be deemed an action, suit or proceeding subject to Section 4.5 of the Credit Agreement; (B) a failure by the Borrower to comply with the laws alleged to have not been complied with, as specified in the Complaint, shall not be deemed a Default or Event of Default relating to Section 5.3 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise a breach of such Section 5.3; and
(C) no prior representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower shall be deemed a misrepresentation by the Borrower for the purposes of Section 6.1(d) of the Credit Agreement by virtue of the Borrower's having omitted a reference to the Complaint or the allegations therein; provided that the agreement herein of the Required Banks is subject to, and the Borrower agrees as consideration for such agreement that: (I) the Borrower shall at no time after the date hereof have commercial paper in an aggregate face amount outstanding exceeding $2,755,000,000 (or, from and after the date of the first Borrowing after the date hereof, such lesser amount as is the Required Level (as defined below)); (II) no Borrowing under the Credit Agreement may be effected (a) for any purpose other than to repay or repurchase the Borrower's commercial paper, (b) unless (i) in the case of the first Borrowing after the date hereof, the Borrower shall have issued a prior notice of its intention to effect a Borrowing and the then aggregate outstanding face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper (which notice may be withdrawn and reissued from time to time; the final non-withdrawn such notice before the first Borrowing after the date hereof being the "Final Intention Notice"; a Final Intention Notice is not the "Notice of Borrowing") that shall not have been previously withdrawn and(ii) as at the date of such first Borrowing that follows the Final Intention Notice, there shall have been repaid (and not reissued) using the Borrower's own funds (i.e., not any funds drawn under any credit facility) an aggregate face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper outstanding on the date of such Final Intention Notice in an amount equal to (X) $500,000,000 adjusted by (Y) (A) if the face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper exceeds $2,400,000,000 on the date of such Final Intention Notice, adding the amount by which, on the date of such Final Intention Notice, the face amount of the Borrower's outstanding commercial paper exceeds $2,400,000,000 or (B) if the face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper is less than $2,400,000,000 on the date of such Final Intention Notice, subtracting the amount by which, on the date of such Final Intention Notice, the face amount of the Borrower's outstanding commercial paper is less than $2,400,000,000 (the level to which the Borrower's commercial paper as at such Borrowing is to be reduced or, if no reduction shall have been required, $1,900,000,000, being the "Required Level") and (c) unless such Borrowing and borrowings under the Other Facilities (as defined below) shall be effected on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof). For the purposes hereof, the "Other Facilities" means each of (x) the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of June 9, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, (y) the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 9, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, and (z) the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of July 7, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A, as Administrative Agent; (III) (a) any repayment of loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof) and (b) any reduction of commitments
under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on such a pro rata basis; (IV) neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary will declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, other than any distribution pursuant to and in accordance with stock option plans or other benefit plans for management or employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. "Restricted Payment" means any distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any shares of any class of capital stock of the Borrower on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any such shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any such shares of capital stock of the Borrower. It is understood that nothing in this clause (IV) shall prohibit the making by the Borrower of any dividend payment, including, without limitation, the cash payment scheduled to be made in November 2004; and (V) the Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to incur any Debt after the date hereof other than Debt incurred under existing facilities. The failure by the Borrower to comply with the foregoing agreements on its part set forth in the preceding clauses (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) shall constitute an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. If you are so willing to agree, please kindly execute this waiver in the space provided below. The waiver and agreements contained in this Waiver Letter shall (i) be effective upon execution and delivery by the Required Banks of this Waiver Letter and execution and delivery by "Required Banks" (or, if required under any of the Other Facilities, all Banks under such Other Facility) under the Other Facilities of a waiver letter in form, scope and substance comparable to this Waiver Letter and (ii) expire and be of no further effect from and after December 30, 2004, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and Required Banks. If there shall have been a Borrowing made on or after the date hereof and prior to the expiry of the agreements in this Waiver Letter which has not been repaid by December 30, 2004, then on December 30, 2004 the Borrower shall be deemed to make each of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4 of the Credit Agreement (except the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the Credit Agreement), and on such date the Administrative Agent shall receive a certificate of the Borrower, dated such date, signed by the chief financial officer, the treasurer or the chief accounting officer of the Borrower to such effect; such representations and certification to be deemed delivered pursuant to the Credit Agreement for all purposes thereof and a failure to supply such certificate shall be an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the waiver and agreements of the Banks contained in this Waiver Letter are granted by the Banks only for the limited purpose set forth herein and each term and provision of the Credit Agreement continues in full force and effect. The waiver and agreements of the Banks herein are granted only for the specific instance specified herein and in no manner creates a course of dealing or otherwise impairs the future ability of the Administrative Agent or the Required Banks to declare an Event of Default under or otherwise enforce the terms of the Credit Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, the Credit Agreement and the other documents related thereto are hereby confirmed and ratified in all respects and shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. This Waiver Letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. This Waiver Letter may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. An executed faxed copy of this Waiver Letter shall be deemed duly delivered by the signatory thereof for all purposes. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of each Bank executing and delivering this Waiver Letter on or prior to close of business, New York time, on Tuesday October 19, 2004, a fee (payable in immediately available funds) of ten (10.0) basis points on such Bank's Commitment.

The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request; (ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000; (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. (g) Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (h) Commitment Utilization. Except for purposes of Section 3.2(c) and for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated in Section 2.9(ii), the amount of any Money Market Loan made by any Bank shall not constitute a use of such Bank's Commitment. Section 2.4 Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. 15
(b) Not later than 12:00 Noon (or 1:00 P.M., in the case of a same day Base Rate Borrowing) (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation), each Bank participating therein shall make available its share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent for account of the Borrower, at account number 323-5-09118 maintained by the Administrative Agent with JPMCB at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Banks in writing). Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower maintained by it with JPMCB at the aforesaid address. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation) that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.7 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. Section 2.5 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Commitments or its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a promissory note forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits G-1 and G-2, in an amount equal to its Commitments or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans, as the case may be. In such event, the Borrower, at its costs, shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). Each such promissory note shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the requesting Bank, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require. 16
(b) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and the type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Banks and each Bank's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 2.6 Maturity of Loans; Rollover Conversions. (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank the entire outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans of such Bank, and each Committed Loan shall mature, on the Termination Date. (b) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank that makes any Money Market Loan the principal amount of such Money Market Loan, and such Money Market Loan shall mature, on the last day of the Interest Period for such Money Market Loan. (c) In the case of any Committed Loan, if the Borrower shall not have given a timely notice prior to the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan for either (i) a Borrowing in a principal amount at least equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period or (ii) a payment or prepayment of the entire amount of such Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period, then, automatically and without further action, such Loan (or relevant portion thereof) will be Converted into, or Continued as, as the case may be, a Base Rate Loan, and a Base Rate Borrowing shall be effected on the last day of such Interest Period in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan not subject to a Borrowing and/or payment/prepayment. Section 2.7 Interest Rates. (a) Base Rate Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Base Rate Loan of such Bank, for each day from the date such Loan is made, Continued or Converted into a Base Rate Loan until it is paid, prepaid, becomes due or is Converted into a Loan of a different type at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate Margin for such day plus the Base Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on 17
the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment or prepayment thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type). (b) Euro-Dollar Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment, prepayment or Continuation thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type) and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage. The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate Service (or on any successor or substitute page of such Service, or any successor to or substitute for such Service, providing rate quotations comparable to those currently provided on such page of such Service, as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in the London interbank market) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period, as the rate for dollar deposits with a maturity comparable to such Interest Period. "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion Dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (as such term is used in Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United States residents). The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage. (c) Money Market Loans. Subject to Section 8.1, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Money Market LIBOR Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section 2.7(b) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the 18
outstanding principal amount of each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. Interest on each Money Market Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than (x) 90 days, in the case of any Money Market Absolute Rate Loan or (y) three months, in the case of any Money Market LIBOR Loan, at intervals of 90 days or three months, respectively, after the first day thereof. (d) Post Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest at the applicable Post-Default Rate on any principal of any Loan of such Bank, and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Bank to or for account of such Bank, which shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), for the period from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date the same is paid in full. Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand. (e) Determinations. The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Section 2.8 Facility Fees. (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with the Pricing Schedule). Such facility fee shall accrue for each Bank (i) from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety, on the daily amount of such Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety to but excluding the date such Bank's Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Loans. (b) Accrued facility fees under this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and on the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety). Section 2.9 Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. During the Revolving Credit Period, the Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Banks upon receipt of such notice), (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time, (ii) reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 the aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (for which purpose use of the Commitments shall be deemed to include the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans) or (iii) reduce from time to time the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an amount such that the aggregate amount of the Commitments (after taking into account such reduction) equals the aggregate outstanding 19
principal amount of the Loans. The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be reinstated. Section 2.10 Scheduled Termination of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and the Borrower hereby promises to pay any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) on such date. Section 2.11 Optional Payments, Prepayments, Conversions and Continuations. (a) Subject in the case of any Fixed Rate Loans to Section 2.13, the Borrower may, (i) upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. on the same day, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any Money Market Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.1) or (ii) upon at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in part, in amounts aggregating $20,000,000 or any larger multiple of $10,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan, pay such Loan on such day in whole or in part by paying the principal amount to be paid together with accrued interest thereon. (b) Other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may prepay, in whole or part, any Money Market Loan only with the written consent of the Bank that has made such Money Market Loan. (c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) above and subsection (e) below, the Borrower may not prepay, Continue or Convert all or any portion of the principal amount of any Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor. (d) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment, Continuation or Conversion pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment, Continuation or Conversion and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (e) The Borrower may Convert or Continue Committed Loans at any time or from time to time, provided that (a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 2.2, (b) any Conversion or Continuation of a Euro-Dollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor shall be subject to Section 2.13 and (c) the Borrower may Convert into or Continue a Euro-Dollar Loan at any time a Default shall be continuing only with the prior written consent of the Required Banks. Section 2.12 General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due, in Dollars in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent at account number 323-5-09118 maintained by the Administrative Agent with JPMCB at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the 20
Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower in writing). If the due date of any payment under this Agreement would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Domestic Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (c) The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank, specify to the Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the Banks for application in such manner as it or the Required Banks, subject to Section 2.15, may determine to be appropriate). (d) Each payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank shall be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds, for account of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made. Section 2.13 Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails to borrow, prepay, Convert into or Continue any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.4(a) or 2.11(d), or the Borrower Converts or Continues any Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment, failure to borrow, prepay, Convert or Continue or Conversion or Continuation, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a written request as to the amount of such loss or expense, which written request shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Continued, Converted or not borrowed, Converted or Continued for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, failure to borrow, Convert or Continue, Conversion or Continuation to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a 21
failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing, Conversion or Continuation) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein (excluding loss of margin) over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market (if such Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan or a Money Market LIBOR Loan) or the United States secondary certificate of deposit market (if such Loan is a Money Market Absolute Rate Loan) for Dollar deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such Bank). Section 2.14 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Section 2.15 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing and Continuation of, and each Conversion into, Committed Loans from the Banks under Section 2.1 shall be made from or by, as the case may be, the Banks, each payment of a facility fee under Section 2.8 shall be made for account of the Banks, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.9 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Banks, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) the making and Continuation of, and Conversion into, Committed Loans shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Committed Loans held by them, provided that if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any Committed Loan the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans shall not be held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made (by reason of a failure of a Bank to make a Loan hereunder in the circumstances described in the last paragraph of Section 9.5), then such payment shall be applied to the Committed Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans being held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments; and (d) each payment of interest on Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the Banks. Section 2.16 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made, Continued or Converted by each Bank shall be made, Continued, Converted and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such type. Section 2.17 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank, and no Bank shall have any obligation to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank for the failure by such Bank to make any Loan required to be made by such Bank. The amounts 22
payable by the Borrower at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Administrative Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes.

If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "London Interbank Offered Rate" in Section 2.7 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for Fixed Rate Loans as provided herein; or (b) in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. During any such suspension unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow, Continue or Convert, as the case may be, on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made or Continued as, or Converted into, a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day. Section 8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or 36
compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain, fund, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank into a Base Rate Loan from such Bank in an equal principal amount (on which Loan interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks). Section 8.3 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make, Continue or Convert Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make, Continue or Convert into Fixed Rate Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, maintaining, Continuing or Converting into any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction which arise out of its Loans or any Notes. (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or 37
administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for the portion of such reduction attributable to its Loans or any Notes. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.3 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 8.4 Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.4, the following terms have the following meanings: "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Bank, (x) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (y) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payment solely as a result of a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office made other than pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4(f). "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp, mortgage recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, the enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. (b) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as 38
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower, shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and as required thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service Form W8-BEN or W8-IMY or W-ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts such Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. (e) For any period with respect to which a Bank required to do so has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure, if required, to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes. (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 8.5 Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans has been 39
suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.3(a) or 8.4 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks); and (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- Section 9.1 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a) in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Bank, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (c) in the case of any party, such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section 9.1 and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section 9.1; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until received. Notices and other communications to the Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article 2 or any notices related to Borrowings, payments or repayments unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Bank. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Section 9.2 No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 40
Section 9.3 Expenses; Indemnification; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including (without duplication) the fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom. (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. Section 9.4 Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise (other than a repayment or prepayment by the Borrower made in accordance with its obligations hereunder), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Section 9.5 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the 41
Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that (a) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder or for the termination of the Commitments, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.5 or any other provision of this Agreement, or (v) amend or modify Sections 2.15, 9.4 and 9.6(a) and (b) any modification or supplement of Article 7 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at a time when the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3 to make any Committed Loan hereunder are, in the reasonable opinion of the Required Banks, satisfied, any Bank shall fail to fulfill its obligations to make such Loan then, for so long as such failure shall continue, such Bank shall (unless the Required Banks, determined as if such Bank were not a "Bank" hereunder, shall otherwise consent in writing) be deemed for all purposes relating to amendments, modifications, waivers or consents under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under this Section 9.5) to have no Loans or Commitments, shall not be treated as a "Bank" hereunder when performing the computation of Required Banks and shall have no rights under the preceding paragraph of this Section 9.5; provided that any action taken by the other Banks with respect to the matters referred to in clause (a) of the preceding paragraph shall not be effective as against such Bank. Section 9.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. (b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.5 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees, subject to subsection (e) below, that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for 42
purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $5,000,000) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the prior written consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld and the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that, so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; provided further that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; and provided further that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Money Market Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrower may bring any proceeding against the Granting Bank or the SPC in order to enforce any rights of the Borrower hereunder. The funding of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Bank provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the prior written 43
consent of each Granting Bank, all or any part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. (d) Any Bank may (without notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and without payment of any fee) at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder. (e) No Assignee, Participant, SPC or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. Section 9.7 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Note or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Section 9.8 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement and any Notes issued hereunder constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of a facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). Section 9.9 Waiver Of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER AND EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 44
Section 9.10 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.13, 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3, and the obligations of the Banks under Section 7.6 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section and to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to any Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to prospective assignees of any Bank who agree to hold such information confidential, or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section by another party hereto or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Banks (and each of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such person to the extent relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. Section 9.12 USA Patriot Act. Each Bank hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (title III of Pub.L.107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank to identify the Borrower in accordance with he Act. * * * 45

EXHIBIT 10.4 WAIVER LETTER (Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 9, 2004) October 17, 2004 To the Banks party to the Credit Agreement referenced below and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. Ladies and Gentlemen: Reference is made to the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 9, 2004 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Credit Agreement"), among Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the "Borrower"), the banks and other financial institutions party thereto (the "Banks"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. As you have been advised, the Attorney General of the State of New York has filed a civil complaint against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. (a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Borrower) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York on October 14, 2004 (the "Complaint"). The Complaint alleges that the Borrower and Marsh Inc. have failed to comply with law, which noncompliance may, if found to be true, (i) result in judgments against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. that may have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole and (ii) have a material adverse effect upon the business, financial position, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. Accordingly, the matters raised by the Complaint may prohibit the Borrower from borrowing a Loan under the Credit Agreement as a result of (x) an inability by the Borrower to bring-down the representation in Section 4.5 [Litigation] of the Credit Agreement and (y) a potential Default under Section 5.3 [Compliance with Laws; Borrowing Authorization] or 6.1(d) [Misrepresentation Default] of the Credit Agreement. As contemplated by Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower desires the Banks to agree that: (A) the Complaint shall not be deemed an action, suit or proceeding subject to Section 4.5 of the Credit Agreement; (B) a failure by the Borrower to comply with the laws alleged to have not been complied with, as specified in the Complaint, shall not be deemed a Default or Event of Default relating to Section 5.3 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise a breach of such Section 5.3; and

For the purposes hereof, the "Other Facilities" means each of (x) the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 13, 2002 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, (y) the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of June 9, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, and (z) the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of July 7, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A, as Administrative Agent; (III) (a) any repayment of loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof) and (b) any reduction of commitments
under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on such a pro rata basis; (IV) neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary will declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, other than any distribution pursuant to and in accordance with stock option plans or other benefit plans for management or employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

It is understood that nothing in this clause (IV) shall prohibit the making by the Borrower of any dividend payment, including, without limitation, the cash payment scheduled to be made in November 2004; and (V) the Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to incur any Debt after the date hereof other than Debt incurred under existing facilities. The failure by the Borrower to comply with the foregoing agreements on its part set forth in the preceding clauses (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) shall constitute an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. If you are so willing to agree, please kindly execute this waiver in the space provided below. The waiver and agreements contained in this Waiver Letter shall (i) be effective upon execution and delivery by the Required Banks of this Waiver Letter and execution and delivery by "Required Banks" (or, if required under any of the Other Facilities, all Banks under such Other Facility) under the Other Facilities of a waiver letter in form, scope and substance comparable to this Waiver Letter and (ii) expire and be of no further effect from and after December 30, 2004, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and Required Banks.

Borrowings are classified for purposes of this Agreement either by reference to the pricing of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a "Fixed Rate Borrowing" is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing or a Money Market Borrowing (excluding any such Borrowing consisting of Money Market LIBOR Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.1), and a "Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of Euro-Dollar Loans) or by reference to the provisions of Article 2 under which participation therein is determined (i.e., a "Committed Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.1 in which all Banks participate in proportion to their Commitments, while a "Money Market Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.3 in which the Bank participants are determined on the basis of their bids in accordance therewith). ARTICLE 2 THE CREDITS ----------- Section 2.1 Commitments to Lend.

amount of Committed Loans by such Bank at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the amount of its Commitment. Each Borrowing of Committed Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of (x) in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, $5,000,000 and (y) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, $10,000,000 or, in either case, any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount available in accordance with Section 3.2) and shall be made from the several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow under this Section, repay, or to the extent permitted by Section 2.11, prepay Loans and reborrow under this Section at any time during the Revolving Credit Period and, subject to Section 2.11, Convert and Continue Committed Loans at any time during the Revolving Credit Period; provided that no more than eight (8) separate Interest Periods in respect of Euro-Dollar Loans from each Bank may be outstanding at any one time and the limitations set forth in Section 2.3(a)(i) shall be applicable. Section 2.2 Notice of Committed Borrowing. (a) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (a "Notice of Committed Borrowing") not later than 10:30 A.M.

The Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section, provided that: (i) there may be no more than eighteen (18) different Interest Periods for both Euro-Dollar Loans and Money Market Loans outstanding at the same time (for which purpose Interest Periods described in different numbered clauses of the definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous); and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of all Committed Loans, at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. 12
(b) Money Market Quote Request. When the Borrower wishes to request offers to make Money Market Loans under this Section, it shall transmit to the Administrative Agent by facsimile a Money Market Quote Request substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto ("Money Market Quote Request") so as to be received not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the fifth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the Domestic Business Day next preceding the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective) specifying: (i) the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall be a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a LIBOR Auction or a Domestic Business Day in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period, and (iv) whether the Money Market Quotes requested are to set forth a Money Market Margin or a Money Market Absolute Rate. The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for more than one Interest Period in a single Money Market Quote Request.

Subject to Articles 3 and 6, any Money Market Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower. (ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify: (A) the proposed date of Borrowing, (B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (x) must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (y) may not exceed the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers were requested and (z) may be subject to an aggregate limitation as to the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers being made by such quoting Bank may be accepted, (C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (the "Money Market Margin") offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted from such base rate, (D) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market Absolute Rate") offered for each such Money Market Loan, and (E) the identity of the quoting Bank. A Money Market Quote may set forth up to three separate offers by the quoting Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation for Money Market Quotes. (iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it: (A) is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto or does not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii); (B) except as provided in Section 2.3(d)(ii)(B)(z), contains qualifying, conditional or similar language; (C) except as provided in Section 2.3(d)(ii)(B)(z), proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or 14

The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted. (f) Acceptance and Notice by the Borrower. Not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to subsection (e) In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request; (ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000; (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. (g) Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such 15
Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (h) Commitment Utilization. Except for purposes of Section 3.2(c) and for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated in Section 2.9(ii), the amount of any Money Market Loan made by any Bank shall not constitute a use of such Bank's Commitment. Section 2.4 Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower maintained by it with JPMCB at the aforesaid address. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation) that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.7 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(a) Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Commitments or its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a promissory note, forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits G-1 and G-2, in an amount equal to its Commitments or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans, as the case may be.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 2.6 Maturity of Loans; Rollover Conversions. (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank the entire outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans of such Bank, and each Committed Loan shall mature, on the Termination Date.

Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period, then, automatically and without further action, such Loan (or relevant portion thereof) will be Converted into, or Continued as, as the case may be, a Base Rate Loan, and a Base Rate Borrowing shall be effected on the last day of such Interest Period in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan not subject to a Borrowing and/or payment/prepayment.

(b) Euro-Dollar Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment, prepayment or Continuation thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type) and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United States residents).

Subject to Section 8.1, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Money Market LIBOR Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section 2.7(b) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3.

Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand. (e) Determinations.

If the Borrower shall have exercised its option specified in Section 2.19, the Commitments shall also be reduced as provided in such Section. The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be reinstated. Section 2.10 Scheduled Termination of Commitments.

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan, pay such Loan on such day in whole or in part by paying the principal amount to be paid together with accrued interest thereon. (b) Other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may prepay, in whole or part, any Money Market Loan only with the written consent of the Bank that has made such Money Market Loan. (c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) above and subsection (e) below, the Borrower may not prepay, Continue or Convert all or any portion of the principal amount of any Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor.

Section 2.12 General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due, in Dollars in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent at account number 323-5-09118 maintained by the Administrative Agent with JPMCB at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower in writing). If the due date of any payment under this Agreement would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Domestic Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (c) The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank, specify to the Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the Banks for application in such manner as it or the Required Banks, subject to Section 2.15, may determine to be appropriate). (d) Each payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank shall be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds, for account of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made. Section 2.13 Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails to borrow, prepay, Convert into or Continue any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in 21
accordance with Section 2.4(a) or 2.11(d), or the Borrower Converts or Continues any Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment, failure to borrow, prepay, Convert or Continue or Conversion or Continuation, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a written request as to the amount of such loss or expense, which written request shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Continued, Converted or not borrowed, Converted or Continued for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, failure to borrow, Convert or Continue, Conversion or Continuation to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing, Conversion or Continuation) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein (excluding loss of margin) over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market (if such Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan or a Money Market LIBOR Loan) or the United States secondary certificate of deposit market (if such Loan is a Money Market Absolute Rate Loan) for Dollar deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such Bank). Section 2.14 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Section 2.15 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing and Continuation of, and each Conversion into, Committed Loans from the Banks under Section 2.1 shall be made from or by, as the case may be, the Banks, each payment of a facility fee under Section 2.8 shall be made for account of the Banks, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.9 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Banks, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) the making and Continuation of, and Conversion into, Committed Loans and any term out of any Committed Loans pursuant to Section 2.19, shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Committed Loans held by them, provided that if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any Committed Loan the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans shall not be held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made (by reason of a failure of a Bank to make a Loan hereunder in the circumstances described in the last paragraph of Section 9.5), then such payment shall be applied to the Committed Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the 22
outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans being held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments; and (d) each payment of interest on Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the Banks. Section 2.16 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made, Continued or Converted by each Bank shall be made, Continued, Converted and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such type. Section 2.17 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank, and no Bank shall have any obligation to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank for the failure by such Bank to make any Loan required to be made by such Bank. The amounts payable by the Borrower at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Administrative Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes. Section 2.18 Termination Date. (a) The Borrower may, by notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Termination Date then in effect (the "Existing Termination Date"), request that the Existing Termination Date be extended to the date which is 364 days (or if such day is not a Domestic Business Day, the next preceding Domestic Business Day) after the Consent Date (defined below). The Administrative Agent shall within five Domestic Business Days of the receipt of such request, give notice to each Bank requesting the consent of the Banks thereto. Each Bank shall consider such request in its sole and independent discretion and may conduct a full credit evaluation of the Borrower in considering such request. Each Bank agreeing to such extension (an "Extending Bank") shall notify the Administrative Agent no sooner than 45 days prior to the Existing Termination Date nor later than the date 30 days prior to the Existing Termination Date (the "Consent Date"); provided that each Bank that determines not to extend the Existing Termination Date (a "Non-extending Bank") shall notify the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the Borrower) promptly after such determination (but in no event later than the Consent Date) and any Bank which does not advise the Administrative Agent of its consent by the Consent Date shall be deemed a Non-extending Bank. Notices to the Administrative Agent regarding extension of the Existing Termination Date shall be revocable until the Consent Date and irrevocable thereafter. (b) The Borrower shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, on or before the Existing Termination Date to replace any Non-extending Bank with one or more other lenders (which may include any Bank, each, for purposes of this Section 2.18, a "Replacement Bank"), each of which Replacement Banks shall have entered into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Replacement Bank shall, effective as of the Existing Termination Date, undertake all or any portion of the Commitment(s) of one or more Non-extending Bank(s). On the Existing Termination Date, the 23
Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to each Non-extending Bank the outstanding principal amount of all Loans held thereby, accrued interest thereon and all other obligations owed to it under this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Existing Termination Date pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall not be effective with respect to any Bank unless: (i) the Administrative Agent has received a certificate of the Borrower, dated the Existing Termination Date, signed by the chief financial officer, the treasurer or the chief accounting officer of the Borrower to the effect that since the date of the most recent financial statements furnished to the Banks pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof prior to the Consent Date, there has occurred no material adverse change in the business, financial position, results of operation or prospects of the Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries, considered as a whole, no Default has occurred or is continuing or will result from extending the Existing Termination Date; and as of the date of such certificate, the representations and warranties made by the Borrower, respectively, in Section 4 are true and correct with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date; (ii) each Non-extending Bank has been paid in full by the Borrower all amounts owing to such Bank hereunder on or before the Existing Termination Date; and (iii) the aggregate Commitments of all Extending Banks and Replacement Banks shall equal the aggregate Commitments immediately prior to such extension. (d) If the Existing Termination Date is extended as aforesaid, (i) the Commitment of each Non-extending Bank shall terminate on the Existing Termination Date and (ii) the aggregate Commitments shall thenceforth be equal to the Commitments of the Extending Banks and the Replacement Banks. Section 2.19 Term-Out. The Borrower may exercise a one time option to extend the Existing Termination Date in respect of each of the Committed Loans outstanding on such date by one year to the date referenced in clause (y) of the definition of "Termination Date" in Section 1.1, by providing notice of such election to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly thereafter notify the Banks thereof) not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Existing Termination Date. If the Borrower exercises such option, on the Existing Termination Date the aggregate Commitments shall be automatically reduced to the principal amount of the Loans outstanding on such date and, thereafter, any payment or prepayment of a Loan shall act to automatically terminate the Commitments in the amount of such payment or prepayment. The Borrower's right to exercise the option provided in this Section 2.19 is subject to there being no Default at the time of the exercise thereof or on the Existing Termination Date. 24

Except with respect to information furnished to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by JPMCB or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "London Interbank Offered Rate" in Section 2.7 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for Fixed Rate Loans as provided herein; or (b) in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. During any such suspension unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow, Continue or Convert, as the case may be, on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made or Continued as, or Converted into, a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day. Section 8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain, fund, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the 38
obligation of such Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank into a Base Rate Loan from such Bank in an equal principal amount (on which Loan interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks). Section 8.3 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make, Continue or Convert Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make, Continue or Convert into Fixed Rate Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, maintaining, Continuing or Converting into any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction which arise out of its Loans or any Notes. (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to 39
the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for the portion of such reduction attributable to its Loans or any Notes. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.3 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 8.4 Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.4, the following terms have the following meanings: "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Bank, (x) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (y) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payment solely as a result of a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office made other than pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4(f). "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp, mortgage recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, the enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. (b) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower, shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address 40
referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and as required thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service Form W8-BEN or W8-IMY or W-ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts such Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. (e) For any period with respect to which a Bank required to do so has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure, if required, to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes. (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 8.5 Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.3(a) or 8.4 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: 41
(a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks); and (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- Section 9.1 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a) in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Bank, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (c) in the case of any party, such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section 9.1 and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section 9.1; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until received. Notices and other communications to the Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article 2 or any notices related to Borrowings, payments or repayments unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Bank. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Section 9.2 No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 9.3 Expenses; Indemnification; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including (without duplication) 42
the fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom. (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. Section 9.4 Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise (other than a repayment or prepayment by the Borrower made in accordance with its obligations hereunder), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Section 9.5 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that (a) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan, 43
or any fees hereunder or for the termination of the Commitments, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.5 or any other provision of this Agreement, or (v) amend or modify Sections 2.15, 9.4 and 9.6(a) and (b) any modification or supplement of Article 7 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at a time when the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3 to make any Committed Loan hereunder are, in the reasonable opinion of the Required Banks, satisfied, any Bank shall fail to fulfill its obligations to make such Loan then, for so long as such failure shall continue, such Bank shall (unless the Required Banks, determined as if such Bank were not a "Bank" hereunder, shall otherwise consent in writing) be deemed for all purposes relating to amendments, modifications, waivers or consents under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under this Section 9.5) to have no Loans or Commitments, shall not be treated as a "Bank" hereunder when performing the computation of Required Banks and shall have no rights under the preceding paragraph of this Section 9.5; provided that any action taken by the other Banks with respect to the matters referred to in clause (a) of the preceding paragraph shall not be effective as against such Bank. Section 9.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. (b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.5 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees, subject to subsection (e) below, that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $5,000,000, or in respect of Loans outstanding during the Term-Out Period, $1,000,000) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note, and such 44
Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the prior written consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld and the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that, so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; provided further that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; and provided further that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Money Market Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrower may bring any proceeding against the Granting Bank or the SPC in order to enforce any rights of the Borrower hereunder. The funding of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Bank provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Bank, all or any part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. (d) Any Bank may (without notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and without payment of any fee) at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal 45
Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder. (e) No Assignee, Participant, SPC or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. Section 9.7 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Note or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Section 9.8 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement and any Notes issued hereunder constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of a facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). Section 9.9 Waiver Of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER AND EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Section 9.10 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.13, 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3, and the obligations of the Banks under Section 7.6 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such 46
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section and to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to any Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to prospective assignees of any Bank who agree to hold such information confidential, or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section by another party hereto or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Banks (and each of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such person to the extent relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. Section 9.12 USA Patriot Act. Each Bank hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (title III of Pub.L.107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank to identify the Borrower in accordance with he Act. * * * 47

EXHIBIT 10.6 WAIVER LETTER (Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of June 9, 2004) October 17, 2004 To the Banks party to the Credit Agreement referenced below and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. Ladies and Gentlemen: Reference is made to the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of June 9, 2004 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Credit Agreement"), among Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the "Borrower"), the banks and other financial institutions party thereto (the "Banks"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. As you have been advised, the Attorney General of the State of New York has filed a civil complaint against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. (a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Borrower) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York on October 14, 2004 (the "Complaint"). The Complaint alleges that the Borrower and Marsh Inc. have failed to comply with law, which noncompliance may, if found to be true, (i) result in judgments against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. that may have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole and (ii) have a material adverse effect upon the business, financial position, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. Accordingly, the matters raised by the Complaint may prohibit the Borrower from borrowing a Loan under the Credit Agreement as a result of (x) an inability by the Borrower to bring-down the representation in Section 4.5 [Litigation] of the Credit Agreement and (y) a potential Default under Section 5.3 [Compliance with Laws; Borrowing Authorization] or 6.1(d) [Misrepresentation Default] of the Credit Agreement. As contemplated by Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower desires the Banks to agree that: (A) the Complaint shall not be deemed an action, suit or proceeding subject to Section 4.5 of the Credit Agreement; (B) a failure by the Borrower to comply with the laws alleged to have not been complied with, as specified in the Complaint, shall not be deemed a Default or Event of Default relating to Section 5.3 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise a breach of such Section 5.3; and
(C) no prior representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower shall be deemed a misrepresentation by the Borrower for the purposes of Section 6.1(d) of the Credit Agreement by virtue of the Borrower's having omitted a reference to the Complaint or the allegations therein; provided that the agreement herein of the Required Banks is subject to, and the Borrower agrees as consideration for such agreement that: (I) the Borrower shall at no time after the date hereof have commercial paper in an aggregate face amount outstanding exceeding $2,755,000,000 (or, from and after the date of the first Borrowing after the date hereof, such lesser amount as is the Required Level (as defined below)); (II) no Borrowing under the Credit Agreement may be effected (a) for any purpose other than to repay or repurchase the Borrower's commercial paper, (b) unless (i) in the case of the first Borrowing after the date hereof, the Borrower shall have issued a prior notice of its intention to effect a Borrowing and the then aggregate outstanding face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper (which notice may be withdrawn and reissued from time to time; the final non-withdrawn such notice before the first Borrowing after the date hereof being the "Final Intention Notice"; a Final Intention Notice is not the "Notice of Borrowing") that shall not have been previously withdrawn and(ii) as at the date of such first Borrowing that follows the Final Intention Notice, there shall have been repaid (and not reissued) using the Borrower's own funds (i.e., not any funds drawn under any credit facility) an aggregate face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper outstanding on the date of such Final Intention Notice in an amount equal to (X) $500,000,000 adjusted by (Y) (A) if the face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper exceeds $2,400,000,000 on the date of such Final Intention Notice, adding the amount by which, on the date of such Final Intention Notice, the face amount of the Borrower's outstanding commercial paper exceeds $2,400,000,000 or (B) if the face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper is less than $2,400,000,000 on the date of such Final Intention Notice, subtracting the amount by which, on the date of such Final Intention Notice, the face amount of the Borrower's outstanding commercial paper is less than $2,400,000,000 (the level to which the Borrower's commercial paper as at such Borrowing is to be reduced or, if no reduction shall have been required, $1,900,000,000, being the "Required Level") and (c) unless such Borrowing and borrowings under the Other Facilities (as defined below) shall be effected on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof). For the purposes hereof, the "Other Facilities" means each of (x) the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 13, 2002 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, (y) the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 9, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, and (z) the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of July 7, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A, as Administrative Agent; (III) (a) any repayment of loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof) and (b) any reduction of commitments
under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on such a pro rata basis; (IV) neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary will declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, other than any distribution pursuant to and in accordance with stock option plans or other benefit plans for management or employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. "Restricted Payment" means any distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any shares of any class of capital stock of the Borrower on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any such shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any such shares of capital stock of the Borrower. It is understood that nothing in this clause (IV) shall prohibit the making by the Borrower of any dividend payment, including, without limitation, the cash payment scheduled to be made in November 2004; and (V) the Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to incur any Debt after the date hereof other than Debt incurred under existing facilities. The failure by the Borrower to comply with the foregoing agreements on its part set forth in the preceding clauses (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) shall constitute an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. If you are so willing to agree, please kindly execute this waiver in the space provided below. The waiver and agreements contained in this Waiver Letter shall (i) be effective upon execution and delivery by the Required Banks of this Waiver Letter and execution and delivery by "Required Banks" (or, if required under any of the Other Facilities, all Banks under such Other Facility) under the Other Facilities of a waiver letter in form, scope and substance comparable to this Waiver Letter and (ii) expire and be of no further effect from and after December 30, 2004, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and Required Banks. If there shall have been a Borrowing made on or after the date hereof and prior to the expiry of the agreements in this Waiver Letter which has not been repaid by December 30, 2004, then on December 30, 2004 the Borrower shall be deemed to make each of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4 of the Credit Agreement (except the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the Credit Agreement), and on such date the Administrative Agent shall receive a certificate of the Borrower, dated such date, signed by the chief financial officer, the treasurer or the chief accounting officer of the Borrower to such effect; such representations and certification to be deemed delivered pursuant to the Credit Agreement for all purposes thereof and a failure to supply such certificate shall be an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the waiver and agreements of the Banks contained in this Waiver Letter are granted by the Banks only for the limited purpose set forth herein and each term and provision of the Credit Agreement continues in full force and effect. The waiver and agreements of the Banks herein are granted only for the specific instance specified herein and in no manner creates a course of dealing or otherwise impairs the future ability of the Administrative Agent or the Required Banks to declare an Event of Default under or otherwise enforce the terms of the Credit Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, the Credit Agreement and the other documents related thereto are hereby confirmed and ratified in all respects and shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. This Waiver Letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

Unless otherwise specified herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted, all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made, and all financial statements required to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time, applied on a basis consistent (except for changes concurred in by the Borrower's independent public accountants) with the most recent audited consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries delivered to the Banks; provided that, if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower wishes to amend any covenant (and any related definition) in Article 5 to eliminate the effect of any change in generally accepted accounting principles on the operation of such covenant (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Required Banks wish to amend Article 5 for such purpose), then the Borrower's compliance with such covenant shall be determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in effect immediately before the relevant change in generally accepted accounting principles became effective, until either such notice is withdrawn or such covenant is amended in a manner satisfactory to the Borrower and the Required Banks. Section 1.3 Types of Borrowings. The term "Borrowing" denotes the aggregation of Loans of one or more Banks to be made pursuant to Article 2 on a single date and for a single Interest Period. A "Borrowing" also includes (x) the conversion ("Conversion") of such aggregation of Loans from one interest rate pricing type of Loan to another type at the end of the Interest Period therefor (or as otherwise provided herein) and (y) the continuation ("Continuation") of such aggregation of Loans at the same interest rate pricing type of Loan from one Interest Period (or as otherwise provided herein) to another; provided that a Loan outstanding as a Money Market Loan shall not be subject to a Conversion or Continuation, nor may a Committed Loan be Converted into a Money Market Loan. Borrowings are classified for purposes of this Agreement either by reference to the pricing of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a "Fixed Rate Borrowing" is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing or a Money Market Borrowing (excluding any such Borrowing consisting of Money Market LIBOR Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.1), and a "Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of Euro-Dollar Loans) or by reference to the provisions of Article 2 under which participation therein is determined (i.e., a "Committed Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.1 in which all Banks participate in proportion to their Commitments, while a "Money Market Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.3 in which the Bank participants are determined on the basis of their bids in accordance therewith). 11
ARTICLE 2 THE CREDITS ----------- Section 2.1 Commitments to Lend. During the Revolving Credit Period, each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make loans to the Borrower pursuant to this Section from time to time in amounts such that the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans by such Bank at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the amount of its Commitment. Each Borrowing of Committed Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of (x) in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, $5,000,000 and (y) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, $10,000,000 or, in either case, any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount available in accordance with Section 3.2) and shall be made from the several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow under this Section, repay, or to the extent permitted by Section 2.11, prepay Loans and reborrow under this Section at any time during the Revolving Credit Period and, subject to Section 2.11, Convert and Continue Committed Loans at any time during the Revolving Credit Period; provided that no more than eight (8) separate Interest Periods in respect of Euro-Dollar Loans from each Bank may be outstanding at any one time and the limitations set forth in Section 2.3(a)(i) shall be applicable. Section 2.2 Notice of Committed Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (a "Notice of Committed Borrowing") not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the date of each Base Rate Borrowing and (y) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying: (a) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic Business Day in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing; (b) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing; (c) whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans; and (d) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period. Section 2.3 Money Market Borrowings. (a) The Money Market Option. In addition to Committed Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.1, the Borrower may, as set forth in this Section, request the Banks during the Revolving Credit Period to make offers to make Money Market Loans to the Borrower. The Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section, provided that: (i) there may be no more than eighteen (18) different Interest Periods for both Euro-Dollar Loans and Money Market Loans outstanding at the same time (for which purpose Interest Periods described in different numbered clauses of the definition 12
of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous); and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of all Committed Loans, at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. (b) Money Market Quote Request. When the Borrower wishes to request offers to make Money Market Loans under this Section, it shall transmit to the Administrative Agent by facsimile a Money Market Quote Request substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto ("Money Market Quote Request") so as to be received not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the fifth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the Domestic Business Day next preceding the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective) specifying: (i) the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall be a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a LIBOR Auction or a Domestic Business Day in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period, and (iv) whether the Money Market Quotes requested are to set forth a Money Market Margin or a Money Market Absolute Rate. The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for more than one Interest Period in a single Money Market Quote Request. No Money Market Quote Request shall be given within five Euro-Dollar Business Days (or such other number of days as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) of any other Money Market Quote Request. (c) Invitation for Money Market Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of a Money Market Quote Request, the Administrative Agent shall send to the Banks by facsimile an Invitation for Money Market Quotes substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto ("Invitation for Money Market Quote"), which shall constitute an invitation by the Borrower to each Bank to submit Money Market Quotes offering to make the Money Market Loans to which such Money Market Quote Request relates in accordance with this Section. (d) Submission and Contents of Money Market Quotes. (i) Each Bank may submit a Money Market Quote containing an offer or offers to make Money Market Loans in response to any Invitation for Money Market Quotes. Each Money Market Quote must comply with the requirements of this subsection (d) and must be submitted to the Administrative Agent 13
by facsimile at its offices specified in or pursuant to Section 9.1 not later than (x) 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the fourth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective); provided that Money Market Quotes submitted by the Administrative Agent (or any affiliate of the Administrative Agent) in its capacity as a Bank may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if the Administrative Agent or such affiliate notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer or offers contained therein not later than (x) one hour prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 15 minutes prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction. Subject to Articles 3 and 6, any Money Market Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower. (ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify: (A) the proposed date of Borrowing, (B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (x) must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (y) may not exceed the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers were requested and (z) may be subject to an aggregate limitation as to the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers being made by such quoting Bank may be accepted, (C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (the "Money Market Margin") offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted from such base rate, (D) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market Absolute Rate") offered for each such Money Market Loan, and (E) the identity of the quoting Bank. A Money Market Quote may set forth up to three separate offers by the quoting Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation for Money Market Quotes. (iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it: (A) is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto or does not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii); 14
(B) except as provided in Section 2.3(d)(ii)(B)(z), contains qualifying, conditional or similar language; (C) except as provided in Section 2.3(d)(ii)(B)(z), proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or (D) arrives after the time set forth in subsection d(i). (e) Notice to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted. (f) Acceptance and Notice by the Borrower. Not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to subsection (e) In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request; (ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000; (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. 15
(g) Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Section 2.4 Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (b) Not later than 12:00 Noon (or 1:00 P.M., in the case of a same day Base Rate Borrowing) (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation), each Bank participating therein shall make available its share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent for account of the Borrower, at account number 1366212250600 maintained by the Administrative Agent with Bank of America at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Banks in writing). Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower maintained by it with Bank of America at the aforesaid address. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation) that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.7 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 16
Section 2.5 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Commitments or its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a promissory note, forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits G-1 and G-2, in an amount equal to its Commitments or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans, as the case may be. In such event, the Borrower, at its costs, shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Bank a promissory note payable to the order of such Bank (or, if requested by such Bank, to such Bank and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). Each such promissory note shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the requesting Bank, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require. (b) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and the type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Banks and each Bank's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 2.6 Maturity of Loans; Rollover Conversions. (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank the entire outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans of such Bank, and each Committed Loan shall mature, on the Termination Date. (b) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank that makes any Money Market Loan the principal amount of such Money Market Loan, and such Money Market Loan shall mature, on the last day of the Interest Period for such Money Market Loan. (c) In the case of any Committed Loan, if the Borrower shall not have given a timely notice prior to the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan for either (i) a Borrowing in 17
a principal amount at least equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period or (ii) a payment or prepayment of the entire amount of such Loan effective on the last day of such Interest Period, then, automatically and without further action, such Loan (or relevant portion thereof) will be Converted into, or Continued as, as the case may be, a Base Rate Loan, and a Base Rate Borrowing shall be effected on the last day of such Interest Period in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan not subject to a Borrowing and/or payment/prepayment. Section 2.7 Interest Rates. (a) Base Rate Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Base Rate Loan of such Bank, for each day from the date such Loan is made, Continued or Converted into a Base Rate Loan until it is paid, prepaid, becomes due or is Converted into a Loan of a different type at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment or prepayment thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type). (b) Euro-Dollar Loans. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of .30% plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof (or any earlier date of payment, prepayment or Continuation thereof or Conversion into a Loan of a different type) and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage. The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate Service (or on any successor or substitute page of such Service, or any successor to or substitute for such Service, providing rate quotations comparable to those currently provided on such page of such Service, as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in the London interbank market) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period, as the rate for dollar deposits with a maturity comparable to such Interest Period. "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion Dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (as such term is used in Regulation D 18
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United States residents). The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage. (c) Money Market Loans. Subject to Section 8.1, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Money Market LIBOR Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section 2.7(b) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan made by such Bank, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by such Bank in accordance with Section 2.3. Interest on each Money Market Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than (x) 90 days, in the case of any Money Market Absolute Rate Loan or (y) three months, in the case of any Money Market LIBOR Loan, at intervals of 90 days or three months, respectively, after the first day thereof. (d) Post Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest at the applicable Post-Default Rate on any principal of any Loan of such Bank, and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Bank to or for account of such Bank, which shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), for the period from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date the same is paid in full. Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand. (e) Determinations. The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Section 2.8 Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee at the rate of .05% per annum. Such facility fee shall accrue for each Bank (i) from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety, on the daily amount of such Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety to but excluding the date such Bank's Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Loans. Accrued facility fees under this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each March 31, 19
June 30, September 30 and December 31 and on the date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety). (b) Continuation Fee. The Borrower hereby promises to pay on February 1, 2005 to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a continuation fee equal to .08% of the amount of such Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused) on such date. Section 2.9 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) During the Revolving Credit Period, the Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Banks upon receipt of such notice), (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time, (ii) reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 the aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (for which purpose use of the Commitments shall be deemed to include the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans) or (iii) reduce from time to time the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an amount such that the aggregate amount of the Commitments (after taking into account such reduction) equals the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans. The Commitments once terminated or reduced (whether pursuant to this subsection or subsection (b) below) may not be reinstated. (b) On the first Euro-Dollar Business Day after the receipt of any Commitments Reduction Amount, the Commitments shall be automatically reduced during the Revolving Credit Period by an amount equal to such Commitments Reduction Amount. Section 2.10 Scheduled Termination of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and the Borrower hereby promises to pay any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) on such date. Section 2.11 Payments, Prepayments, Conversions and Continuations. (a) Subject in the case of any Fixed Rate Loans to Section 2.13, the Borrower may, (i) upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the same day, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any Money Market Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.1) or (ii) upon at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in part, in amounts aggregating $20,000,000 or any larger multiple of $10,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the last day of the Interest Period for any Loan, pay such Loan on such day in whole or in part by paying the principal amount to be paid together with accrued interest thereon. (b) Not later than 10:30 a.m. on the first Euro-Dollar Business Day after the receipt of any Prepayment Amount, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of such receipt and shall on such Euro-Dollar Business Day prepay the Loans in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such Prepayment Amount and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Loans. 20
Each such prepayment shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued interest on such Loans, together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13, and shall be applied pro rata to the Loans held by the Banks. (c) Other than as required by subsection (b) above, and other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may prepay, in whole or part, any Money Market Loan only with the written consent of the Bank that has made such Money Market Loan. (d) Except as provided in subsections (a), (b) and (c) above and subsection (f) below, the Borrower may not prepay, Continue or Convert all or any portion of the principal amount of any Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor. (e) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment, Continuation or Conversion pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment, Continuation or Conversion and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (f) The Borrower may Convert or Continue Committed Loans at any time or from time to time, provided that (a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 2.2, (b) any Conversion or Continuation of a Euro-Dollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor shall be subject to Section 2.13 and (c) the Borrower may Convert into or Continue a Euro-Dollar Loan at any time a Default shall be continuing only with the prior written consent of the Required Banks. Section 2.12 General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment or prepayment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due, in Dollars in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent at account number 1366212250600 maintained by the Administrative Agent with Bank of America at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower in writing). If the due date of any payment or prepayment under this Agreement would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Domestic Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment or prepayment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment or prepayment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment or prepayment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment or prepayment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 21
(c) The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment or prepayment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank, specify to the Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment or prepayment is to be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment or prepayment to the Banks for application in such manner as it or the Required Banks, subject to Section 2.15, may determine to be appropriate).

immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower. Section 6.2 Notice of Default by Banks. Each Bank shall give notice to the Administrative Agent and each other Bank promptly after such Bank obtains knowledge that a Default has occurred under Section 6.1(a) with respect to such Bank's Money Market Loans. ARTICLE 7 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ------------------------ Section 7.1 Appointment and Authorization.

Section 7.2 Administrative Agent and Affiliates. Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and Bank of America and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent and Bank of America and its affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks. Except with respect to information furnished to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by Bank of America or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Section 7.3 Action by Administrative Agent. The obligations of the Administrative Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein, and the Administrative Agent shall not by reason of this Agreement be a trustee for any Bank.

Section 7.5 Liability of Administrative Agent. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks (or each Bank, if applicable) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 3, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith.

Section 7.6 Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with its Commitment (and, after the Commitments have been terminated, ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by such Bank), indemnify the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, judgment, suit, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder. Section 7.7 Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.

Section 7.8 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, subject, so long as no Event of Default shall be continuing, to the approval of such successor Administrative Agent by the Borrower. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and approved by the Borrower, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and which is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor 36
Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent. Section 7.9 Administrative Agent's Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Such fees once paid shall be non-refundable. ARTICLE 8 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES ----------------------- Section 8.1 Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "London Interbank Offered Rate" in Section 2.7 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for Fixed Rate Loans as provided herein; or (b) in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. During any such suspension unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow, Continue or Convert, as the case may be, on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made or Continued as, or Converted into, a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day. Section 8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any 37
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain, fund, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank into a Base Rate Loan from such Bank in an equal principal amount (on which Loan interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks). Section 8.3 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make, Continue or Convert Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make, Continue or Convert into Fixed Rate Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, maintaining, Continuing or Converting into any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction which arise out of its Loans or any Notes. (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such 38
law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for the portion of such reduction attributable to its Loans or any Notes. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.3 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 8.4 Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.4, the following terms have the following meanings: "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment or prepayment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Bank, (x) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments or prepayments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (y) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payment or prepayment solely as a result of a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office made other than pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4(f). "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp, mortgage recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment or prepayment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, the enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. (b) Any and all payments or prepayments by the Borrower to or for account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without 39
deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments or prepayments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower, shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and as required thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service Form W8-BEN or W8-IMY or W-ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts such Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. (e) For any period with respect to which a Bank required to do so has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure, if required, to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes. (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. 40
Section 8.5 Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.3(a) or 8.4 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks); and (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments or prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- Section 9.1 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a) in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Bank, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (c) in the case of any party, such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section 9.1 and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section 9.1; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until received. Notices and other communications to the Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article 2 or any notices related to Borrowings, payments or prepayments unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Bank. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Section 9.2 No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further 41
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 9.3 Expenses; Indemnification; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including (without duplication) the fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom. (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. Section 9.4 Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise (other than a repayment or prepayment by the Borrower made in accordance with its obligations hereunder), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 42
Section 9.5 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that (a) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment or prepayment of principal of or interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder or for the reduction or termination of the Commitments, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.5 or any other provision of this Agreement, or (v) amend or modify Sections 2.15, 9.4 and 9.6(a) and (b) any modification or supplement of Article 7 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at a time when the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3 to make any Committed Loan hereunder are, in the reasonable opinion of the Required Banks, satisfied, any Bank shall fail to fulfill its obligations to make such Loan then, for so long as such failure shall continue, such Bank shall (unless the Required Banks, determined as if such Bank were not a "Bank" hereunder, shall otherwise consent in writing) be deemed for all purposes relating to amendments, modifications, waivers or consents under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under this Section 9.5) to have no Loans or Commitments, shall not be treated as a "Bank" hereunder when performing the computation of Required Banks and shall have no rights under the preceding paragraph of this Section 9.5; provided that any action taken by the other Banks with respect to the matters referred to in clause (a) of the preceding paragraph shall not be effective as against such Bank. Section 9.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. (b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.5 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees, subject to subsection (e) below, that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or 43
other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $5,000,000) of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the prior written consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld and the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that, so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; provided further that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; and provided further that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Money Market Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrower may bring any proceeding against the Granting Bank or the SPC in order to enforce any rights of the Borrower hereunder. The funding of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Bank provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any 44
surety or guarantee to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Bank, all or any part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. (d) Any Bank may (without notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and without payment of any fee) at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder. (e) No Assignee, Participant, SPC or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. Section 9.7 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Note or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Section 9.8 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement and any Notes issued hereunder constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of a facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). Section 9.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER AND EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 45
Section 9.10 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.13, 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3, and the obligations of the Banks under Section 7.6 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section and to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to any Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to prospective assignees of any Bank who agree to hold such information confidential, or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section by another party hereto or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Banks (and each of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such person to the extent relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. Section 9.12 USA Patriot Act. The Administrative Agent and each Bank hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (title III of Pub.L.107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow the Administrative Agent or such Bank to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act. * * * 46

EXHIBIT 10.8 WAIVER LETTER (Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of July 7, 2004) October 17, 2004 To the Banks party to the Credit Agreement referenced below and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Ladies and Gentlemen: Reference is made to the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of July 7, 2004 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Credit Agreement"), among Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the "Borrower"), the banks and other financial institutions party thereto (the "Banks"), and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. As you have been advised, the Attorney General of the State of New York has filed a civil complaint against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. (a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Borrower) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York on October 14, 2004 (the "Complaint"). The Complaint alleges that the Borrower and Marsh Inc. have failed to comply with law, which noncompliance may, if found to be true, (i) result in judgments against the Borrower and Marsh Inc. that may have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole and (ii) have a material adverse effect upon the business, financial position, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. Accordingly, the matters raised by the Complaint may prohibit the Borrower from borrowing a Loan under the Credit Agreement as a result of (x) an inability by the Borrower to bring-down the representation in Section 4.5 [Litigation] of the Credit Agreement and (y) a potential Default under Section 5.3 [Compliance with Laws; Borrowing Authorization] or 6.1(d) [Misrepresentation Default] of the Credit Agreement. As contemplated by Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower desires the Banks to agree that: (A) the Complaint shall not be deemed an action, suit or proceeding subject to Section 4.5 of the Credit Agreement; (B) a failure by the Borrower to comply with the laws alleged to have not been complied with, as specified in the Complaint, shall not be deemed a Default or Event of Default relating to Section 5.3 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise a breach of such Section 5.3; and
(C) no prior representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower shall be deemed a misrepresentation by the Borrower for the purposes of Section 6.1(d) of the Credit Agreement by virtue of the Borrower's having omitted a reference to the Complaint or the allegations therein; provided that the agreement herein of the Banks is subject to, and the Borrower agrees as consideration for such agreement that: (I) the Borrower shall at no time after the date hereof have commercial paper in an aggregate face amount outstanding exceeding $2,755,000,000 (or, from and after the date of the first Borrowing after the date hereof, such lesser amount as is the Required Level (as defined below)); (II) no Borrowing under the Credit Agreement may be effected (a) for any purpose other than to repay or repurchase the Borrower's commercial paper (and Section 5.6 of the Credit Agreement is modified accordingly), (b) unless (i) in the case of the first Borrowing after the date hereof, the Borrower shall have issued a prior notice of its intention to effect a Borrowing and the then aggregate outstanding face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper (which notice may be withdrawn and reissued from time to time; the final non-withdrawn such notice before the first Borrowing after the date hereof being the "Final Intention Notice"; a Final Intention Notice is not the "Notice of Borrowing") that shall not have been previously withdrawn and(ii) as at the date of such first Borrowing that follows the Final Intention Notice, there shall have been repaid (and not reissued) using the Borrower's own funds (i.e., not any funds drawn under any credit facility) an aggregate face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper outstanding on the date of such Final Intention Notice in an amount equal to (X) $500,000,000 adjusted by (Y) (A) if the face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper exceeds $2,400,000,000 on the date of such Final Intention Notice, adding the amount by which, on the date of such Final Intention Notice, the face amount of the Borrower's outstanding commercial paper exceeds $2,400,000,000 or (B) if the face amount of the Borrower's commercial paper is less than $2,400,000,000 on the date of such Final Intention Notice, subtracting the amount by which, on the date of such Final Intention Notice, the face amount of the Borrower's outstanding commercial paper is less than $2,400,000,000 (the level to which the Borrower's commercial paper as at such Borrowing is to be reduced or, if no reduction shall have been required, $1,900,000,000, being the "Required Level") and (c) unless such Borrowing and borrowings under the Other Facilities (as defined below) shall be effected on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof). For the purposes hereof, the "Other Facilities" means each of (x) the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 13, 2002 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, (y) the Credit Agreement [364 Day] dated as of June 9, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, and (z) the Credit Agreement [5 Year] dated as of June 9, 2004 among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent; (III) (a) any repayment of loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on a pro rata basis (based on the relative aggregate commitments under each thereof on the date hereof) and (b) any reduction of commitments
under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities shall be effected by the Borrower on such a pro rata basis, and Section 2.9 of the Credit Agreement is modified accordingly; (IV) neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary will declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, other than any distribution pursuant to and in accordance with stock option plans or other benefit plans for management or employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. "Restricted Payment" means any distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any shares of any class of capital stock of the Borrower on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any such shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any such shares of capital stock of the Borrower. It is understood that nothing in this clause (IV) shall prohibit the making by the Borrower of any dividend payment, including, without limitation, the cash payment scheduled to be made in November 2004; and (V) the Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to incur any Debt after the date hereof other than Debt incurred under existing facilities. The failure by the Borrower to comply with the foregoing agreements on its part set forth in the preceding clauses (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) shall constitute an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. If you are so willing to agree, please kindly execute this waiver in the space provided below. The waiver and agreements contained in this Waiver Letter shall (i) be effective upon execution and delivery by the Banks of this Waiver Letter and execution and delivery by "Required Banks" under the Other Facilities of a waiver letter in form, scope and substance comparable to this Waiver Letter and (ii) expire and be of no further effect from and after December 30, 2004, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and such Banks as are necessary to effect such agreement under the Credit Agreement. If there shall have been a Borrowing made on or after the date hereof and prior to the expiry of the agreements in this Waiver Letter which has not been repaid by December 30, 2004, then on December 30, 2004 the Borrower shall be deemed to make each of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4 of the Credit Agreement (except the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the Credit Agreement), and on such date the Administrative Agent shall receive a certificate of the Borrower, dated such date, signed by the chief financial officer, the treasurer or the chief accounting officer of the Borrower to such effect; such representations and certification to be deemed delivered pursuant to the Credit Agreement for all purposes thereof and a failure to supply such certificate shall be an Event of Default for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the waiver and agreements of the Banks contained in this Waiver Letter are granted by the Banks only for the limited purpose set forth herein and each term and provision of the Credit Agreement continues in full force and effect. The waiver and agreements of the Banks herein are granted only for the specific instance specified herein and in no manner creates a course of dealing or otherwise impairs the future ability of the Administrative Agent or the Required Banks to declare an Event of Default under or otherwise enforce the terms of the Credit Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, the Credit Agreement and the other documents related thereto are hereby confirmed and ratified in all respects and shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. This Waiver Letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. This Waiver Letter may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. An executed faxed copy of this Waiver Letter shall be deemed duly delivered by the signatory thereof for all purposes. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of each Bank executing and delivering this Waiver Letter on or prior to close of business, New York time, on Tuesday October 19, 2004, a fee (payable in immediately available funds) of ten (10.0) basis points on such Bank's Commitment.
