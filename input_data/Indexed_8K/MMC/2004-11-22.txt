Section 1--Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On November 17, 2004, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC") entered into a commitment letter with Citibank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and certain of their affiliates (the "Arranging Banks") with respect to a new $1 billion term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility") and the amendment of $1.7 billion of existing revolving facilities (the "Revolving Facilities" and together with the Term Loan Facility, the "Facilities"). The Term Loan Facility would replace MMC's existing $700 million and $355 million revolving credit facilities which are due to expire in 2005. The Arranging Banks have committed an aggregate of $525 million to the Term Loan Facility with the balance to be raised in the syndicated bank loan market. The commitment letter is subject to certain customary conditions including satisfactory completion of documentation, due diligence and syndication. The Term Loan Facility will mature December 31, 2006, $1 billion of the amended Revolving Facilities will mature June 13, 2007 and $700 million of the amended Revolving Facilities will mature June 9, 2009. The Facilities will be unconditionally guaranteed by Marsh Inc., Putnam Investments Trust and Mercer Inc. MMC expects that the closing of the Facilities will occur in mid-December. While MMC knows of no reason why it will not be able to achieve this goal, there can be no assurance. The foregoing brief summary of the commitment letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the commitment letter, a copy of which is filed herewith. Section 9--Financial Statements and Exhibits Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits 10.1 Commitment Letter dated as of November 17, 2004 among MMC, Citibank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and certain of their affiliates. 2
INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("MMC") and their representatives may from time to time make verbal or written statements (including certain statements contained in this report and other MMC filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our reports to stockholders) relating to future results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, discussions concerning revenues, expenses, earnings, cash flow, elimination of market service agreements ("MSA"), capital structure, existing credit facilities, access to commercial paper markets, pension funding, the adverse consequences arising from market-timing issues at Putnam, including fines and restitution, the matters raised in the complaint filed by the New York State Attorney General's Office stating a claim for, among other things, fraud and violations of New York State antitrust and securities laws, as well as market and industry conditions, premium rates, financial markets, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, contingencies, and matters relating to MMC's operations and income taxes. Such forward-looking statements are based on available current market and industry materials, experts' reports and opinions, and long-term trends, as well as management's expectations concerning future events impacting MMC. Forward-looking statements by their very nature involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements contained herein include, in the case of MMC's risk and insurance services business, changes in competitive conditions, the impact of litigation and other matters concerning the claims brought by the New York State Attorney General's Office and state insurance regulators, loss of clients, inability to collect previously accrued MSA revenue, movements in premium rate levels, the conditions for the transfer of commercial risk and other changes in the global property and casualty insurance markets, natural catastrophes, mergers between client organizations, and insurance or reinsurance company insolvencies. Factors to be considered in the case of MMC's investment management business include changes in worldwide and national equity and fixed income markets, actual and relative investment performance, the level of sales and redemptions, and the ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at historic levels; and with respect to all of MMC's activities, the ability to amend or replace MMC's existing credit facilities to provide long term support for commercial paper borrowings following the claims brought by the New York State Attorney General, the continued strength of MMC's relationships with its employees and clients, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize expected synergies, changes in general worldwide and national economic conditions, the impact of terrorist attacks, changes in the value of investments made in individual companies and investment funds, fluctuations in foreign currencies, actions of competitors or regulators, changes in interest rates or in the ability to access financial markets, developments relating to claims, lawsuits and contingencies, prospective and retrospective changes in the tax or accounting treatment of MMC's operations, and the impact of tax and other legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which MMC operates. 3
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and MMC undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K for "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," its reports on Form 8-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. MMC is committed to providing timely and materially accurate information to the investing public, consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations. To that end, MMC and its operating companies use their websites to convey meaningful information about their businesses, including the anticipated release of quarterly financial results and the posting of updates of assets under management at Putnam. Monthly updates of total assets under management at Putnam will be posted to the MMC website the first business day following the end of each month. Putnam posts mutual fund and performance data to its website regularly. Assets for most Putnam retail mutual funds are posted approximately two weeks after each month-end. Mutual fund net asset value (NAV) is posted daily. Historical performance and Lipper rankings are also provided.

The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Lender Parties, each Lender and each of their respective affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), joint or several, that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or the preparation of a defense in connection therewith), in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of this Commitment Letter or the Operative Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Facilities, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or 3
not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Company, any of its directors, security holders or creditors, an Indemnified Party or any other person or an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. No Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Company or any of its security holders or creditors for or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such liability is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event, however, shall any Indemnified Party be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings). Section 6. Costs and Expenses.

Section 7. Confidentiality. By accepting delivery of this Commitment Letter, the Company agrees that this Commitment Letter is for the Company's confidential use only and that neither its existence nor the terms hereof will be disclosed by the Company to any person other than the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants, attorneys and other advisors, agents and representatives (the "Company Representatives") and then only on a confidential and "need to know" basis in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company may make such other public disclosures of the terms and conditions hereof as the Company is required by law, in the opinion of the Company's counsel, to make. The Lender Parties agree that the provisions of Section 9.11 of the Existing Revolving Facilities apply to any information made available to them in connection with this Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 8. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company represents and warrants that (a) all information (other than projections) that has been or will hereafter be made available to the Lender Parties, any Lender or any potential Lender by the Company or any of its representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is or will, when furnished, be complete and correct in all material respects and does not or will not, when furnished, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements were or are made and (b) all projections, if any, that have been or will be prepared by the Company and made available to the Lender Parties, any Lender or any potential Lender have been or will be prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions (it being understood that such projections are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and that no assurance can be given that the projections will be realized). The Company agrees to supplement the information and projections from time to time until the Operative Documents become effective so that the representations and warranties contained in this paragraph remain correct. In providing this Commitment Letter, the Lender Parties are relying on the accuracy of the information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company and its affiliates without independent verification thereof. 4
Section 9. No Third Party Reliance, Etc. The agreements of the Lender Parties hereunder and of any Lender that issues a commitment to provide financing under the Term Facility or that consents to the Revolving Facilities are made solely for the benefit of the Company and may not be relied upon or enforced by any other person. Please note that this Commitment Letter does not include all of the terms and conditions of the Facilities, and that those matters that are not covered or made clear herein are subject to mutual agreement of the parties. The Company may not assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender Parties. This Commitment Letter may not be amended or modified, or any provision hereof waived, except by a written agreement signed by all parties hereto. This Commitment Letter is not intended to create a fiduciary relationship among the parties hereto. The Company acknowledges that the Lender Parties and/or one or more affiliates of each of the Lender Parties may provide financing, equity capital, financial advisory and/or other services to parties whose interests may conflict with the Company's interests. Consistent with each Lender Party's policy to hold in confidence the affairs of its customers, each Lender Party agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates will furnish confidential information obtained from the Company to any of such Lender Party's other customers. Furthermore, neither any Lender Party nor any of its respective affiliates will make available to the Company confidential information that such Lender Party obtained or may obtain from any other person. Each Lender Party reserves the right to employ the services of its affiliates in providing the services contemplated by this Commitment Letter and to allocate, in whole or in part, to such affiliates any fees payable to it in such manner as it and its affiliates may agree in their sole discretion; provided that the Company shall incur no additional obligations as a result of any such allocation. Section 10. Governing Law, Etc. This Commitment Letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. This Commitment Letter sets forth the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and supersedes all prior communications, written or oral, with respect hereto.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Commitment Letter by telecopier shall be as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Commitment Letter. Sections 4 through 8, 10 and 11 hereof shall survive the termination of the commitments of the Lender Parties hereunder. The Company acknowledges that information and documents relating to the Facilities may be transmitted through Intralinks, the internet or similar electronic transmission systems. Section 11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, performance or enforcement hereof. 5
