(a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (b) Not later than 12:00 Noon (or 1:00 P.M., in the case of a same day Base Rate Borrowing) (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation), each Bank participating therein shall make available its share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent for account of the Borrower, at account number 36852248 maintained by the Administrative Agent with Citibank at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Banks in writing).

(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Borrowing (that is not a Conversion or Continuation) that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.7 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.

Each such promissory note shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the requesting Bank, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. (b) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section 2.11(b), to the extent that the proceeds of any Settlement Debt described in clause (b) of the definition thereof or of any Settlement Proceeds described in clause (b) of the definition thereof are (A) not used to pay Settlement Costs within six months after the date of the certification referred to in such clauses or (B) no longer expected by the Borrower in good faith to be used to pay Settlement Costs, such proceeds shall be deemed to be Net Cash Proceeds (which are not Settlement Proceeds or proceeds of any Settlement Debt described in clause (b) of the definition thereof) received by the Borrower on the last day of such six-month period or on the date on which such proceeds are no longer expected by the Borrower in good faith to be used for such purpose, as the case may be. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of the anticipated receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds and any prepayment required by this Section 2.11(b) no later than 10:30 A.M.

(d) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment, Continuation or Conversion pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such prepayment, Continuation or Conversion and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (e) The Borrower may Convert or Continue Committed Loans at any time or from time to time, provided that (a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 2.2, (b) any Conversion or Continuation of a Euro-Dollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor shall be subject to Section 2.13 and (c) the Borrower may Convert into or Continue a Euro-Dollar Loan at any time a Default shall be continuing only with the prior written consent of the Required Banks. Section 2.12 General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due, in Dollars in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent at account number 36852248 maintained by the Administrative Agent with Citibank at its address referred to in Section 9.1 (or to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower in writing). If the due date of any payment under this Agreement would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Domestic Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. 20
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (c) The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank, specify to the Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the Banks for application in such manner as it or the Required Banks, subject to Section 2.15, may determine to be appropriate). (d) Each payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank shall be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds, for account of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made. Section 2.13 Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails to borrow, prepay, Convert into or Continue any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.4(a) or 2.11(d), or the Borrower Converts or Continues any Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment, failure to borrow, prepay, Convert or Continue or Conversion or Continuation, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a written request as to the amount of such loss or expense, which written request shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Continued, Converted or not borrowed, Converted or Continued for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, failure to borrow, Convert or Continue, Conversion or Continuation to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing, Conversion or Continuation) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein (excluding loss of margin) over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market. 21
Section 2.14 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Section 2.15 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing and Continuation of, and each Conversion into, Committed Loans from the Banks under Section 2.1 shall be made from or by, as the case may be, the Banks pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) the making and Continuation of, and Conversion into, Committed Loans shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Committed Loans held by them, provided that if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any Committed Loan the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans shall not be held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made (by reason of a failure of a Bank to make a Loan hereunder in the circumstances described in the last paragraph of Section 9.5), then such payment shall be applied to the Committed Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans being held by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments; and (d) each payment of interest on Committed Loans shall be made for account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the Banks. Section 2.16 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made, Continued or Converted by each Bank shall be made, Continued, Converted and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such type. Section 2.17 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank, and no Bank shall have any obligation to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank for the failure by such Bank to make any Loan required to be made by such Bank. The amounts payable by the Borrower at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Administrative Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, subject, so long as no Event of Default shall be continuing, to the approval of such successor Administrative Agent by the Borrower. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and approved by the Borrower, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and which is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.

Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.

If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "London Interbank Offered Rate" in Section 2.7 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for Fixed Rate Loans as provided herein; or (b) Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. During any such suspension unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow, Continue or Convert, as the case may be, on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made or Continued as, or Converted into, a Base Rate Borrowing. Section 8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain, fund, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the 40
other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank into a Base Rate Loan from such Bank in an equal principal amount (on which Loan interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks). Section 8.3 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make, Continue or Convert into Fixed Rate Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, maintaining, Continuing or Converting into any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any Note that relates to Fixed Rate Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction which arise out of its Loans or any Notes. (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to 41
the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for the portion of such reduction attributable to its Loans or any Notes. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.3 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 8.4 Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.4, the following terms have the following meanings: "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Bank, (x) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement or (y) any United States withholding tax imposed on such payment solely as a result of a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office made other than pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4(f). "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp, mortgage recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, the enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. (b) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower, shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address 42
referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and as required thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts such Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. (e) For any period with respect to which a Bank required to do so has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure, if required, to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes. (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 8.5 Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, Continue or Convert into Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.3(a) or 8.4 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: 43
(a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks); and (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- Section 9.1 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a) in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Bank, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (c) in the case of any party, such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section 9.1 and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section 9.1; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until received. Notices and other communications to the Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article 2 or any notices related to Borrowings, payments or repayments unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Bank. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Section 9.2 No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Section 9.3 Expenses; Indemnification; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including (without duplication) 44
the fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom. (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. Section 9.4 Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise (other than a repayment or prepayment by the Borrower made in accordance with its obligations hereunder), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loan made by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Section 9.5 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Banks) (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that (a) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan, or any fees 45
hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder or for the termination of the Commitments, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.5 or any other provision of this Agreement, (v) amend or modify Sections 2.15, 9.4 and 9.6(a) or (vi) reduce or limit the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 1 of the Subsidiary Guaranty to which it is a party or release any such Subsidiary Guaranty, and (b) any modification or supplement of Article 7 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at a time when the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3 to make any Committed Loan hereunder are, in the reasonable opinion of the Required Banks, satisfied, any Bank shall fail to fulfill its obligations to make such Loan then, for so long as such failure shall continue, such Bank shall (unless the Required Banks, determined as if such Bank were not a "Bank" hereunder, shall otherwise consent in writing) be deemed for all purposes relating to amendments, modifications, waivers or consents under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under this Section 9.5) to have no Loans or Commitments, shall not be treated as a "Bank" hereunder when performing the computation of Required Banks and shall have no rights under the preceding paragraph of this Section 9.5; provided that any action taken by the other Banks with respect to the matters referred to in clause (a) of the preceding paragraph shall not be effective as against such Bank. Section 9.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. (b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.5 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees, subject to subsection (e) below, that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee"), all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial 46
Commitment of not less than $10,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note and the other Loan Documents, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the prior written consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld and the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that, so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower; provided further that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required of the Borrower. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrower may bring any proceeding against the Granting Bank or the SPC in order to enforce any rights of the Borrower hereunder. The funding of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Bank provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Bank, all or any part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. (d) Any Bank may (without notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and without payment of any fee) at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank as 47
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder. (e) No Assignee, Participant, SPC or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. Section 9.7 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Note or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Section 9.8 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement and any Notes issued hereunder (and the Master Agreement and the Subsidiary Guaranties) constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of a facsimile or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). Section 9.9 Waiver Of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER AND EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE, the other Loan Documents OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Section 9.10 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.13, 8.3, 8.4 and 9.3, and the obligations of the Banks under Section 7.6 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may 48
be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section and to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to any Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to prospective assignees of any Bank who agree to hold such information confidential, or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section by another party hereto or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. It is understood that for purposes of this Section, the Borrower and its business shall include all of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower and all of the businesses they engage in. Section 9.12 USA Patriot Act. Each Bank hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (title III of Pub.L.107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act. Section 9.13 Master Agreement. Each Bank hereby consents to the execution and delivery of the Master Agreement by the Administrative Agent and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof. * * * 49
