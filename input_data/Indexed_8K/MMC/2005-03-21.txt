Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by any person appointed by the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, in the case of an Annual Meeting of Stockholders, not less than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the Stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 15

To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 15
th
day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.

Notwithstanding anything in these by-laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with said procedure.
The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

ARTICLE VI
Indemnification
SECTION 1.
Right to Indemnification
. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter, a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that, on or after May 21, 1987, he or she is serving or had served as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or, while serving as such director, officer or employee, is serving or had served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in any other capacity with respect to, another corporation or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter, an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be changed or amended (but, in the case of any such change or amendment, only to the extent that such change or amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by an indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators;
provided
,
however
, that except as provided in Section 3 of this Article with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
 
thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right.
SECTION 2.
Advancement of Expenses
. An indemnitee who is a director or officer of the Corporation, and any other indemnitee to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors of the Corporation, shall have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter, an "advancement of expenses");
provided
,
however
, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter, an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter, a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article or otherwise.
SECTION 3.
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
. If a claim under Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days in the case of Section 1 and twenty days in the case of Section 2 after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (other than a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses), it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to the action. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
SECTION 4.
Indemnification of Agents of the Corporation
. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its board of directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification of directors, officers and employees of the Corporation and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
SECTION 5.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. The right to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws, any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
SECTION 6.
Insurance
. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
SECTION 7.
Survival of Prior Indemnification Provisions; Effect of Subsequent Change on Existing Rights
. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as altering or eliminating the rights to indemnification existing, or based upon service by an indemnitee, prior to May 21, 1987. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director, officer or employee of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

Each certificate shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or Lead Director, as the case may be, or a Vice President and also by the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, provided, however, that any such signature of an officer of the Corporation or of the Transfer Agent, Assistant Transfer Agent, Registrar or Assistant Registrar, or any of them, may be a facsimile. In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the Corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation and be used and delivered as though the officer or officers who signed the said certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be said officer or officers of the Corporation. All certificates shall be consecutively numbered, shall bear the corporate seal and the names and addresses of all persons owning shares of capital stock of the Corporation with the number of shares owned by each; and, the date or dates of issue of the shares of stock held by each shall be entered in books kept for that purpose by the proper officers or agents of the Corporation.

Recognition of Holders of Record
. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof, and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it has actual or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.
SECTION 3.
Lost Certificates
.
