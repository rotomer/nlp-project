Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, May 3, 2005Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Consolidated revenues totaled $3.2 billion, and net income was $134 million, or $.25 per share. These results include pretax charges for restructuring, employee retention, incremental regulatory and compliance, and potential Putnam fund reimbursement expenses of approximately $225 million. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been $.52. In the first quarter of 2004, net income was $446 million, or $.83 per share. Prior year quarterly results include settlement expenses, insurance recoveries relating to World Trade Center losses, severance, and regulatory and compliance costs, which reduced first quarter 2004 net income by $73 million. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been $.96 per share. Additional information on these items and their effect on operating income and earnings per share is provided in the attached supplemental schedules on pages 11 and 12.
Michael G. Cherkasky, president and chief executive officer of MMC, said: "We continue to take steps across MMC to make it a stronger, more streamlined company. Marsh is executing its plan to simplify its management structure, improve efficiencies and account profitability, and increase transparency. These changes should enable Marsh to deliver profitable growth and margin expansion next year. Kroll had a strong quarter, as demand for its technology services increased significantly. Mercer Human Resource Consulting made significant progress in expanding its outsourcing capabilities and range of investment advice and services, including the combination of its existing benefits administration operations with Putnam's defined contribution administration activities. Mercer's specialty consulting businesses performed very well, reporting strong revenue growth. Putnam's investment performance has continued to improve, reflecting changes made over the last 18 months. We continue to see a moderation in net redemptions."
MMC now reports financial results in four segments:
o     comprising risk management and insurance broking (Marsh), reinsurance broking and services (Guy Carpenter), and related insurance services;
Risk and Insurance Services,
o     (Kroll);
Risk Consulting and Technology
o     including Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Mercer's specialty consulting businesses; and
Consulting,
o     (Putnam).
Investment Management
Risk and Insurance Services
Risk and insurance services revenues declined 11 percent in the quarter to $1.7 billion. Underlying revenues, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, declined 13 percent. Market services revenues declined $179 million to $32 million in the quarter. Excluding the loss of market services revenues, underlying revenues declined 5 percent.
Marsh's risk management and insurance broking revenues declined 19 percent to $1.2 billion due to the termination of market services agreements, the effect of reduced insurance premium rates, and a lower volume of net new business. The decline was most significant in the United States, with modest declines in the rest of the world consistent with the softening of premium pricing.
Guy Carpenter reported first quarter revenues of $282 million, unchanged from 2004. Underlying revenues declined 2 percent. Carpenter's new business in the quarter was stronger than the prior year quarter but was offset by the effect of higher risk retentions and lower premium rates in the reinsurance marketplace.
Related insurance services revenues rose 26 percent to $294 million, an 18 percent increase on an underlying basis. This reflects strong growth in claims management as well as higher investment gains in the quarter.
As expected, restructuring and other noteworthy expenses significantly affected risk and insurance services operating income of $171 million. Approximately $65 million of savings associated with the fourth quarter restructuring were more than offset by $96 million for additional restructuring, $43 million of incremental regulatory and compliance costs, and $15 million for employee retention programs in the first quarter. Bonus accruals for the full year are being kept flat to 2004 levels to assure that the proper levels of incentives are maintained in a challenging year. The elimination of market services revenues removed a significant seasonality factor that had a corresponding impact on bonus accruals. First quarter bonus accruals were $42 million higher than the prior year quarter. Additional restructuring charges are anticipated over the course of 2005 for severance and real estate costs.
Risk Consulting and Technology
Kroll performed well, reporting $264 million in revenues. Its growth was excellent, with particular strength in technology services' electronic discovery and background screening operations. First quarter revenues also reflect the integration of portions of Marsh's risk consulting operations. Operating income was $37 million for the quarter, including $16 million of identified intangible amortization.
Consulting
Consulting revenues increased 4 percent in the first quarter to $834 million. Underlying revenues increased 1 percent. Operating income of $84 million includes $10 million of retention expenses.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting reported revenues of $586 million, compared with $589 million last year. The reduction in underlying revenues was due to the decline in revenues associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by Putnam. The health and benefits business and the performance, rewards, and information business both reported good revenue growth. A modest decline in the retirement business was largely due to lower demand in the United Kingdom.
Mercer's specialty consulting businesses produced $210 million in revenues, an increase of 17 percent from last year. Underlying revenues grew 13 percent. Mercer Management Consulting, Mercer Oliver Wyman, and NERA Economic Consulting each reported solid revenue growth.
Investment Management
Putnam's revenues in the first quarter declined 12 percent to $398 million, in line with the year-over-year change in average assets under management. Average assets under management during the first quarter were $204 billion, compared with $234 billion in the first quarter of 2004. Total assets under management on March 31, 2005 were $199 billion, comprising $135 billion of mutual fund assets and $64 billion of institutional assets. Assets under management at year-end 2004 were $213 billion.
Putnam's operating income of $49 million includes a charge of $30 million for the estimated cost that it believes will be necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts paid by the Putnam mutual funds in previous years. The previous payments were cost reimbursements by the Putnam mutual funds to Putnam for transfer agent services relating to defined contribution operations.
The steps Putnam has taken over the last 18 months have led to an improvement in investment performance. For the one-year period ended March 31, 2005, 61 percent of all Putnam mutual fund A-share assets, including 50 percent of equity products and 95 percent of fixed income products, were above median for investment performance in their respective Lipper categories. Net redemptions of $9.7 billion in the quarter include $2.7 billion related to the termination of certain Putnam international alliances on the first day of 2005. Since then, net redemptions have been lower than they were in each of the previous five quarters. Putnam had modest gains in mutual funds sales for the second quarter in a row.

Notes
Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue, before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, using consistent currency exchange rates. Underlying revenue for risk management and insurance broking decreased 21% in the first quarter, including a 10% decline related to market services agreements; and for the risk and insurance services segment underlying revenue decreased 13% in the first quarter including an 8% decline related to market services agreements.
Effective October 1, 2004 Marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers. Market services revenue earned but not accrued at September 30, 2004 is recognized when collected or when confirmation of the amount of payment is received from the carriers. First quarter results include market services revenue of $32 million and $211 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Interest income on fiduciary funds amounted to $35 million and $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Segment Reclassification
MMC has reclassified prior year amounts to reflect organizational changes that affected MMC's reportable segments. The following changes are reflected in the 2004 segment data presented above:
Risk Consulting and Technology, a new reportable segment, includes Kroll, Inc., which was acquired by MMC in July 2004 and portions of risk consulting business previously managed by Marsh. Services include: forensic accounting and litigation support; business continuity management; mass tort and complex liability mitigation; and comprehensive data services for the management of insurance, claims and legal data.
Putnam's defined contribution administration business was transferred from Putnam (Investment Management) to Human Resource Consulting (Consulting). Approximately 75% of the revenues earned by Mercer Human Resources from this transferred business are paid by Putnam. Putnam receives fees for investment management and administrative services, which are recorded as revenue. A fee related to administrative services is recorded as an expense by Putnam and as revenue by Mercer Human Resources. The inter-company revenue and expense are eliminated in consolidation. Corporate eliminations for 2004 reflect the additional inter-company revenue and expense resulting from the transfer of this business.
Note
MMC's consolidated effective tax rate was 34.9% in the first quarter of 2005. The effective tax rate applicable to ongoing operating income was 35%
Categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with Putnam's various prospectuses. All quarter-end assets conform with the current investment mandate for each product.
(a) Excludes the impact of the acquisition of PanAgora in July 2004, which increased reported assets under management by $8.2 billion.
Reconciliation of the Impact of Non-GAAP Measures on Diluted Earnings Per Share
NON-GAAP MEASURES: MMC believes that the investors' understanding of its results and operations is enhanced by the disclosure of additional non-GAAP financial information. A number of noteworthy items impacted operating income in 2005. MMC believes this schedule provides a concise analysis of the effects of these items. Nonetheless, it is pertinent to note that the amounts shown in the captions Operating Income As Adjusted and Operating Income Margin As Adjusted are measures.
non-GAAP
(a) Market services revenue of $32 million is included in Operating Income As Reported and Operating Income As Adjusted.
(b) Corporate expenses in 2005 include restructuring charges of $49 million related to the consolidation of office space in London. Mercer colleagues that were expected to occupy newly leased space will be relocated to existing Marsh office space. Because London real estate is managed by MMC and actions undertaken benefited MMC as a whole, rather than any particular operating company, the related charge was recorded in corporate expenses.
(c) Regulatory and compliance costs in the risk and insurance services segment includes professional services provided by other MMC companies. The inter-company amounts are eliminated in corporate.
(d) Represents estimated costs that Putnam believes will be necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts paid by the Putnam mutual funds in previous years. The previous payments were cost reimbursements by the Putnam mutual funds to Putnam for transfer agency services related to defined contribution operations.
(e) Other primarily reflects accelerated leasehold aamortization and gain on the sale of the corporate jet.
