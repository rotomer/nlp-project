Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
Company
"), proposes to issue and sell to each of the Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (collectively, the "
Underwriters
") for whom Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "
Representatives
"), the principal amount of its securities identified in Schedule II hereto (the "
Notes
"), to be issued under an indenture dated as of July 14, 2004 (the "
Original Indenture
") and a second supplemental indenture relating to the Notes to be dated the Closing Date (the "
Supplemental Indenture
", and, together with the Original Indenture, the "
Indenture
"), between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "
Trustee
").
On September 5, 2003 the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission
") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-108566) for the registration of the offer and sale of certain securities, including the Notes, from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
Securities Act
"), and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to the date hereof. Such registration statement, as so amended, has been declared effective by the Commission, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "
Trust Indenture Act
"). The Company has furnished to you, for use by the Underwriters and by dealers, electronic copies of one or more preliminary prospectus supplements (the "
Preliminary Prospectus Supplements
") relating to the Notes. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a final prospectus
 
 
 
 
 
supplement (the "
Final Prospectus Supplement
") reflecting the terms of the Notes, the terms of the offering thereof and the other matters set forth therein, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The registration statement, in the form in which it became effective and all post-effective amendments thereto, is herein called the "
Registration Statement
". The prospectus dated September 16, 2003 in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter referred to as the "
Basic Prospectus
". The term "
Prospectus
" means the Basic Prospectus together with the Final Prospectus Supplement relating to the sale of the Notes by the Underwriters in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes. If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement to register additional Notes or other debt securities pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "

462 Registration Statement
"), then any reference herein to the term "

7.    
Indemnity and Contribution
. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
 
 
10
 
 
 
Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein and except, that with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, such indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or the benefit of any person controlling any Underwriter) if the person asserting any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses purchased the Notes that are the subject thereof from any Underwriter and if such person was not sent or given a copy of the Prospectus at or prior to confirmation of the sale of such Notes to such person in any case where such sending or giving is required by the Securities Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus, provided such Prospectus was delivered to you in accordance with Section 6(a).
(b)    Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c)    In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
 
 
11
 
 
 
indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party failed to retain satisfactory counsel in a timely manner. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter and such control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a); and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d)    To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in amount in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or if the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price
 
 
12
 
 
 
of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)    The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by
pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7(d) and 7(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (e) and subsection (d) above, to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Notes and not joint.
(f)     The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any termination of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any person controlling the Underwriters or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, its directors or any person controlling the Company and acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
8.    
Termination
. This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Representatives to the Company if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (a) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (b) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter
 
 
13
 
 
 
market, (c) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (d) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Representatives' judgment, is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a) through (d), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the Representatives' judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
9.    
Defaulting Underwriters
. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligations to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase at the Closing Date under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Notes on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of the Notes, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
(b)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on the Closing Date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Notes which such Underwriter has agreed to purchase under this Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Notes of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
 
14
 
 
 
(c)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Notes which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to purchased on the Closing Date, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof, but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10.  
Effectiveness
. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

14.  
No Fiduciary Duty

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am General Counsel of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and as such have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale today by the Company of $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.15% Senior Notes due 2010 (the "2010 Notes") and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes" and together with the 2010 Notes the "Notes") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 13, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, you and the other underwriters named therein. The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of July 14, 2004 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 16, 2005 (the "Supplemental Indenture;" the Base Indenture, as so supplemented, being referred to herein as the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In so acting, I or one or more attorneys acting under my general supervision (all references herein to acts taken by me include acts by one or more attorneys acting under my general supervision) have participated in the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 
 
B-1
 
 
 
"Commission"), pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of the prospectus supplement, dated September 13, 2005 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), relating to the Notes. The Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-108566) relating to certain securities issuable by the Company from time to time, as amended to the date of the Underwriting Agreement, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus dated September 16, 2003, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes, is referred to herein as the "Prospectus," and such terms include in each case the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
 
In connection with rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined the form of the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and originals or certified, conformed or reproduction copies of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company, such certificates of public officials, and such other documents, and have made such investigations of law, as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinions. In all such examinations, I have assumed without investigation the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness of all signatures on original or certified copies, the authenticity of all original or certified copies and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to me as conformed or reproduction copies. I have relied as to factual matters upon, and have assumed the accuracy of, the statements made in the certificates of officers of the Company delivered to me and certificates and other statements or information of or from public officials and officers and representatives of the Company and others.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
 
(i)          The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(ii)          The Company has been duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified would not be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
(iii)         The Company has the corporate power and authority to conduct its business and own its properties, in each case, as described in the Prospectus.
 
 
B-2
 
 
 
(iv)         Each of Marsh Inc. ("Marsh") and Mercer Inc. ("Mercer") has been duly incorporated, and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to conduct its business and own its properties as described in the Prospectus; Putnam, LLC ("Putnam") has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with limited liability company power and authority to conduct its business and own its properties as described in the Prospectus; and, except as described in or contemplated by the Prospectus, (
i
) all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Marsh and Mercer have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, (
ii
) all the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Putnam have been duly authorized and validly issued and (
iii
) except for the Class B Common Stock of Putnam Investments Trust, the parent of Putnam, all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Marsh and Mercer and limited liability company interests of Putnam are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all liens or encumbrances.
(v)          and will not, violate any existing order or decree of, or settlement agreement with any court or governmental agency or body known to me to be binding upon the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, except for any such violations as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as whole (provided, that I express no opinion as to any applicable securities laws, rules and regulations).
(vi)         Except as described in or contemplated by the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or, to my knowledge, overtly threatened in writing to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is bound or to which any property of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is subject, which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and to my knowledge, there are no contracts or other documents required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be described in
 
 
B-3
 
 
 
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not so filed or described.
(vii)         To my knowledge, there is no contract, agreement, or understanding between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to register any securities of the Company for offering and sale under the Securities Act by reason of the filing of the Registration Statement with the Commission.
(viii)         The statements set forth or incorporated by reference in (

(B) If less than all the Fixed Rate Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000) or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of such series of Fixed Rate Notes of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Fixed Rate Notes of such series to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Fixed Rate Notes to be redeemed, in whole or in part.

10
 
 
 
said principal sum from September 16, 2005 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "

The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Note is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.

5.15% Senior Notes due 2010
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "
Notes
"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to an indenture (the "
Base Indenture
") dated as of July 14, 2004 among the Company, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "
Trustee
"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 16, 2005 among the Company and the Trustee (the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "
Indenture
"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Notes. This series of Notes is limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in said Second Supplemental Indenture. This series of Notes and any Additional Notes of this series shall constitute one series for all purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation, amendments, waivers and redemptions. The terms and conditions of this series of Notes and any Additional Notes of this series (other than the issue price, the date of issuance, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Additional Notes and the first payment of interest following such issue date) shall be the same and shall bear the same CUSIP number.
The Notes may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Issuer, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at then current Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date (the "
Redemption Price
"). In case the Company shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Notes, the Company shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Notes to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder received the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Note designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Note of such series.
 
 
17
 
 
 
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the Redemption Price at which the Notes are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the Redemption Price of such Notes to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, upon presentation and surrender of such Notes, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue. If less than all the Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of the Notes of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Notes to be redeemed. In case any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such security, a new Note of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000) or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of such Notes of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Notes to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Notes to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
The Company may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by its President or any Vice President, instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Notes for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Note, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions stated herein.
Subject to Section 2.11 of the Base Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Fixed Rate Notes of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Fixed Rate Notes of such series selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Fixed Rate Notes
 
 
18
 
 
 
of any series so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any such Fixed Rate Notes being redeemed in part.
If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Fixed Rate Notes or portions of the Fixed Rate Notes of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price, and interest on such Fixed Rate Notes shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Redemption Price.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series affected at the time Outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holders of each Note then Outstanding and affected thereby (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Notes of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Notes, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Notes of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes of such series and except as provided in Section 6.06 of the Base Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.
 
 
19
 
 
 
The Issuer is subject to certain covenants contained in the Indenture with respect to, and for the benefit of the Holders of, the Notes. The Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Issuer's compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture or with respect to reports or other certificates filed under the Indenture;
provided
,
however
, that nothing herein shall relieve the Trustee of any obligations to monitor the Issuer's timely delivery of all reports and certificates required under Section 5.03 of the Indenture and to fulfill its obligations under Article VII of the Indenture. If an Event of Default as defined in the Indenture with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request.

22
 
 
 
said principal sum from September 16, 2005 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "
Interest Payment Date
") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year commencing March 15, 2006 at the rate of 5.75% per annum until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium, if any, and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum. The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Note is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in said Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment which shall be March 1 or September 1 preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for (as defined in the Indenture, the "
Defaulted Interest
") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holders on such regular record date, and may be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall not be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment, and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment or at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest on this Note shall be payable at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;
provided

5.75% Senior Notes due 2015
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "
Notes
"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to an indenture (the "
Base Indenture
") dated as of July 14, 2004 among the Company, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "
Trustee
"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 16, 2005 among the Company and the Trustee (the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "
Indenture
"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Notes. This series of Notes is limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in said Second Supplemental Indenture. This series of Notes and any Additional Notes of this series shall constitute one series for all purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation, amendments, waivers and redemptions. The terms and conditions of this series of Notes and any Additional Notes of this series (other than the issue price, the date of issuance, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Additional Notes and the first payment of interest following such issue date) shall be the same and shall bear the same CUSIP number.
The Notes may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Issuer, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at then current Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date (the "
Redemption Price
"). In case the Company shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Notes, the Company shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Notes to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder received the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Note designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Note of such series.
 
 
29
 
 
 
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the Redemption Price at which the Notes are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the Redemption Price of such Notes to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, upon presentation and surrender of such Notes, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue. If less than all the Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of the Notes of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Notes to be redeemed. In case any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such security, a new Note of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000) or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of such Notes of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Notes to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Notes to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
The Company may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by its President or any Vice President, instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Notes for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Note, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions stated herein.
Subject to Section 2.11 of the Base Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Fixed Rate Notes of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Fixed Rate Notes of such series selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Fixed Rate
 
 
30
 
 
 
Notes of any series so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any such Fixed Rate Notes being redeemed in part.
If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Fixed Rate Notes or portions of the Fixed Rate Notes of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price, and interest on such Fixed Rate Notes shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Redemption Price.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series affected at the time Outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holders of each Note then Outstanding and affected thereby (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Notes of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Notes, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Notes of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes of such series and except as provided in Section 6.06 of the Base Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.
 
 
31
 
 
 
The Issuer is subject to certain covenants contained in the Indenture with respect to, and for the benefit of the Holders of, the Notes. The Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Issuer's compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture or with respect to reports or other certificates filed under the Indenture;
provided
,
however
, that nothing herein shall relieve the Trustee of any obligations to monitor the Issuer's timely delivery of all reports and certificates required under Section 5.03 of the Indenture and to fulfill its obligations under Article VII of the Indenture. If an Event of Default as defined in the Indenture with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any interest on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable by the registered holder hereof on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee duly executed by the registered holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing
 
 
32
 
 
 
hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Notes of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in authorized denominations. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations herein and therein set forth, Notes of this series so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
THE INDENTURE AND THE NOTES INCLUDING THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused "CUSIP" numbers to be printed on the Notes as a convenience to the Holders of the Notes. No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such CUSIP numbers as printed on the Notes, and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purposes.
