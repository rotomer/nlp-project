Item 1.01.  Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 17, 2005, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC"") entered into an employment agreement (the "Agreement") with Mathis Cabiallavetta, MMC's Vice Chairman, Office of the Chief Executive Officer.
 
The Agreement is effective as of November 1, 2005 and has an initial term of three years. The Agreement will automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless either party notifies the other that it does not wish to renew the Agreement. If MMC does not renew the Agreement, then upon the subsequent termination of Mr. Cabiallavetta's employment (other than termination by MMC for cause, as defined in the Agreement), Mr. Cabiallavetta would be deemed to have twenty-five (25) years of service under the MMC Special Severance Pay Plan as of the date of termination. The effect of this provision on Mr. Cabiallavetta's participation in the MMC Special Severance Pay Plan is to provide him with shares of MMC stock equal to 90% of the value of certain restricted stock, or awards in lieu of restricted stock, that are forfeited upon termination of his employment.
 
Under the Agreement, Mr. Cabiallavetta is entitled to an annual base salary divided into two parts based on expected worktime in the United States. The two parts are $360,000 and 810,000 Swiss Francs (CHF) (with adjustment for actual days worked in the US). Mr. Cabiallavetta is eligible for an annual bonus opportunity with a range of 100% to 200% of his annual base salary. The bonus will be paid in U.S. dollars ($) and Swiss Francs (CHF) consistent with the methodology used to pay Mr. Cabiallavetta's base salary. Mr. Cabiallavetta will be eligible to participate in MMC's long-term incentive compensation plans applicable to senior executive officers, under which he will be eligible for an annual grant comprised of a mix of long-term equity incentive compensation awards with a combined grant-date target value of between one-time and two-times annual base salary. The Agreement also provides for a retention award comprised of 21,200 restricted stock units that vest on October 31, 2008.
 
If Mr. Cabiallavetta's employment is terminated for any reason, he will receive previously earned but unpaid base salary and bonus. If his employment is terminated by MMC other than for cause (as defined in the Agreement) or if he resigns for good reason (as defined in the Agreement), Mr. Cabiallavetta would also be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his then current annual base salary and his average annual bonus during the previous three years, a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination of employment and vesting of his equity awards, and he would be deemed to have twenty-five (25) years of service under the MMC Special Severance Pay Plan as of the date of termination. If such termination of employment without cause or for good reason is in connection with a change in control (as defined in the Agreement), Mr. Cabiallavetta would be entitled to receive two times the sum of his annual base salary and average annual bonus during the previous three years, as well as a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination of employment and vesting of his equity awards.

Payments made to Mr. Cabiallavetta in connection with his termination of employment are generally subject to his delivery to MMC of a general release of claims. Under the Agreement, Mr. Cabiallavetta will be subject to certain non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions for twelve months following his termination of employment.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The Executive shall have such duties and responsibilities and power and authority as those normally associated with the position of Vice Chairman, as well as any additional duties, responsibilities and/or powers and authority assigned to him by the Chief Executive Officer which are consistent with his position as Vice Chairman.
The Executive agrees to use his best efforts to promote the interests of the Company, and agrees that he will devote his entire working time, care and attention to his duties, responsibilities and obligations to the Company throughout the Term (as defined in Section 2.1 hereof). The Executive may serve on the boards of other civic, charitable and corporate entities with the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer and manage his personal investments and affairs, so long as such activities do not, either individually or in the aggregate, interfere with the Executive's duties and responsibilities as Vice Chairman.

. The initial term of the Executive's employment under this Agreement (the "
Initial Term
") shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue through October 31, 2008. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each, a "
Renewal Term
") unless either party sends a notice of termination to the other party in accordance with Section 6.2 hereof at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be. The Initial Term, together with any and all Renewal Terms, if any, are the "

As compensation and consideration for the performance by the Executive of his obligations under this Agreement, during the Term the Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits set forth in this Article 3 (collectively, "

The actual bonus amounts will be determined by the Committee based on the achievement of entity and individual performance goals, with bonuses in the upper portion of the annual bonus opportunity range being earned only for superior achievement of such performance goals. Except as provided in the following sentence, the annual bonus shall be paid in the same time and manner as corresponding awards to other senior executives of the Company generally.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall each year grant to the Executive, no later than it makes corresponding awards to other senior executives of the Company generally, and on terms and conditions that are both consistent with this Agreement and no less favorable to the Executive than the terms and conditions that apply to corresponding awards to other senior executives of the Company generally, long-term incentive compensation with a combined grant-date target value between one-time and two-times the Executive's Base Salary, as determined by the Committee.
3.4

The Executive shall also be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs based on the degree of achievement of goals at year end under the bonus program in effect at the time of termination and the portion of the year elapsed as of the date of such termination. The degree of achievement of goals shall be determined in accordance with the bonus program, except that should any goals be of a subjective nature, the degree of achievement thereof shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Any such bonus amount shall be paid at the same time as annual bonuses for the year are paid to the Company's senior executives generally. In addition, upon such a termination (i) all unvested equity awards held by the Executive as of the date of termination that were granted to the Executive pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 3.3 hereof shall immediately fully vest as of the date of termination and (ii) solely for purposes of determining the Executive's eligibility and severance amount under the MMC Special Severance Pay Plan, the Executive shall be deemed to have twenty-five (25) years of service as of the date of termination.

times the Annual Compensation (as defined in Section 5.5(d) hereof). The Executive shall also be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs based on the portion of the year elapsed as of the date of such termination multiplied by the greater of (I) the Executive's target annual bonus for the year of termination or (II) the average annual bonus actually paid to the Executive (including amounts paid in restricted stock units that are specifically designated as being part of the annual bonus, if any) during the three years prior to the termination. Any such bonus amount shall be paid as provided in Section 5.7 hereof. In addition, all equity-based awards held by the Executive as of the date of the Change in Control shall vest in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable equity compensation plan and/or agreement, provided, however, that all equity-based awards granted to the Executive which are unvested on the date of termination shall then immediately fully vest. Payments due to the Executive under this Section 5.6 shall be offset, dollar-for-dollar, by corresponding amounts (if any) previously paid under Section 5.5(d) (e.g., if the termination occurred prior to the pertinent Change in Control).
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.7
          
Conditions

(c)
          
delivery to the Company of a resignation from all offices, directorships and fiduciary positions with the Company, its affiliates and employee benefit plans.
Notwithstanding the due date of any post-employment payments, any amounts due following a termination under this Agreement (other than the Accrued Obligations, which shall be paid when due or on such later date as may be required to avoid any "additional tax" under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A")) shall not be due until after the expiration of any revocation period applicable to the General Release without the Executive having revoked such General Release, and any such amounts shall be paid to the Executive within thirty (30) days of the expiration of such revocation period without the occurrence of a revocation by the Executive (or the earliest date as may be required to avoid any "additional tax" under Section 409A). Nevertheless (and regardless of whether the General Release has been executed by the Executive), upon any termination of Executive's employment, Executive shall be entitled to receive the Accrued Obligations, payable within thirty (30) days after the date of termination or in accordance with the applicable plan, program or policy.
5.8
          
No Mitigation
. The Executive shall be under no obligation to seek other employment following a termination of his employment with the Company or any subsidiary for any reason. In addition, there shall be no offset against amounts due to the Executive under this Article 5 or otherwise on account of any compensation attributable to any subsequent employment.

Such cooperation shall include appearing from time to time at the offices of the Company or any subsidiary or their counsel for conferences and interviews and in general providing the officers of the Company or any subsidiary and their counsel with the full benefit of the Executive's knowledge with respect to any such matter. The Executive further agrees, upon termination of his employment for any reason, to assist his successor in the transition of his
 
 
 
 
 
 
duties and responsibilities to such successor. The Executive agrees to render such cooperation in a timely fashion and at such times as may be mutually agreeable to the parties.
