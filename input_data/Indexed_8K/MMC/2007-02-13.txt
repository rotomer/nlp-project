MMC REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END 2006 RESULTS
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, February 13, 2007Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter were $3.1 billion, an increase of 9 percent from 2005. Consolidated net income was $226 million, an increase of over 500 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005, and earnings per share grew to $.40 from $.06. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $.39 in the fourth quarter from $.03 last year.
 
Full-year consolidated revenues were $11.9 billion, an increase of 3 percent from $11.6 billion in 2005. Consolidated net income was $990 million, or $1.76 per share, compared with $404 million, or $.74 per share, in 2005. Results from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $172 million, or $.31 per share, resulting primarily from MMC's sale of its investment in Sedgwick Claims Management in early 2006. Results from discontinued operations in 2005 were $37 million, or $.07 per share. Income from continuing operations was $818 million, or $1.45 per share, compared with $367 million, or $.67 per share, in 2005. Stock option expense in 2006 was $116 million. Stock option expense in 2005 was $64 million, and related only to the last two quarters of 2005 since MMC adopted SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," on July 1, 2005.

A number of noteworthy items affected financial results, including restructuring costs and credits; legal and regulatory costs primarily related to market service agreements; and other items indicated in the attached supplemental information. In the fourth quarter of 2006, noteworthy items were a credit of $5 million, including the realized gain of $74 million on the sale of five floors in MMC's corporate headquarters, while noteworthy items in 2005 reduced earnings per share from continuing operations by $.18. For the full year, noteworthy items reduced earnings per share by $.19 in 2006, compared with $.76 in 2005.
 
"MMC had another good quarter, reporting its strongest revenue growth in three years," said Michael G. Cherkasky, president and chief executive officer of MMC. "The progress we saw at Marsh in the first nine months of 2006 continued in the fourth quarter, including improved revenue trends and increased profitability. Revenues from new business at Marsh were the highest they have been since the first half of 2004. In light of this, we are encouraged about Marsh's prospects in 2007. Throughout the year, Guy Carpenter rose to the challenges of a complex reinsurance marketplace, producing increased revenues driven by double-digit growth in new business. Kroll's increased revenues in the quarter were driven by solid results in its technology business. In the quarter, Mercer Human Resource Consulting improved margins and produced strong revenue growth, and Mercer Specialty Consulting continued its exceptional performance, reporting double-digit revenue growth. Putnam's net flows were neutral in the quarter, achieving a long-standing goal.
 
"The announced sale of Putnam will enhance our financial flexibility and allow us to concentrate on our market-leading risk and human capital businesses. We have reignited MMC's engines of growth, and we look forward to the future with confidence," Mr. Cherkasky concluded.
 
Risk and Insurance Services
Risk and insurance services revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4 percent to $1.4 billion, or 5 percent on an underlying basis. Operating income more than doubled to $127

million, compared with $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting gains from private equity investments, operating efficiencies, cost discipline, and restructuring efforts.
 
Marsh's underlying revenues grew 3 percent, excluding the impact of market service revenues, the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth by this measure and the largest in over two years. Strong new business growth across all geographies drove Marsh's performance. For the full year, new business increased a robust 10 percent, with accelerating growth as the year progressed, including 9 percent growth in the Americas. As reported, Marsh's revenues declined 1 percent to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter.
 
Guy Carpenter's revenues increased 9 percent in the fourth quarter to $171 million, or 8 percent on an underlying basis, driven by 13 percent growth in new business. These results were achieved despite a reinsurance marketplace where increases in U.S. property catastrophe rates were mitigated by reduced reinsurance capacity and higher client risk retentions, and where rates in most other lines of business were stable to down globally.
 
Risk Capital Holdings generated revenues of $74 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $27 million in the same period of 2005. This increase was entirely due to mark-to-market gains in private equity investments. Full-year revenues were $193 million, compared with $189 million in 2005.
 
Risk Consulting and Technology
Kroll's revenues increased 12 percent in the fourth quarter to $241 million, or 4 percent on an underlying basis. Kroll's technology enabled solutions business produced 17 percent growth in revenues, including double-digit growth in background screening and technology services. Kroll's profitability in the quarter increased significantly, due to revenue growth, expense control, and the early termination of a licensing agreement. Results reflect the sale of Kroll's international security business, which has been included in MMC's discontinued operations.

Consulting
Revenues for consulting increased 15 percent to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, or 10 percent on an underlying basis. Operating income grew 24 percent. Full-year revenues increased 11 percent to $4.2 billion, or 9 percent on an underlying basis.
 
Mercer Human Resource Consulting increased revenues 12 percent to $769 million in the fourth quarter, or 8 percent on an underlying basis. This strong growth was driven by the retirement and investment business and the talent business. Full-year revenues increased 8 percent to $3 billion, or 7 percent on an underlying basis.
 
Mercer Specialty Consulting's revenues grew 23 percent to $341 million in the fourth quarter, or 15 percent on an underlying basis. Full-year revenues increased 19 percent to $1.2 billion, or 16 percent on an underlying basis. Each of the Mercer Specialty companies contributed to this exceptional performance, led by Mercer Oliver Wyman, which increased underlying revenues 22 percent.
 
Investment Management
Putnam's revenues of $359 million were flat, compared with the fourth quarter last year. Ending assets on December 31, 2006 were $192 billion, comprising $124 billion in mutual fund assets and $68 billion in institutional assets. Average assets under management were $189 billion, compared with $188 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Operating income increased on a year-over-year basis, due to lower expenses. With the announced sale of Putnam on February 1, Putnam will be classified as a discontinued operation in 2007.
 
Other Items
MMC's net debt position, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $2.9 billion at year-end 2006, a decrease of $520 million in the fourth quarter and $640 million in the year, driven by strong operating cash flows. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 12 percent, from $.17 to $.19, payable in the first quarter of 2007.

The year-over-year comparability of MMC's fourth quarter and twelve-month financial results is affected by a number of noteworthy items and stock option expense. The following table identifies the impact of noteworthy items on operating income for the periods indicated.
Significant Items Impacting the Comparability of Financial Results:
Notes:
(a) Primarily includes severance and related charges, costs for future rent and other costs for real estate resulting from cost reduction initiatives and the gain on the sale of certain floors in MMC's headquarters building (see MMC's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2005 and Form 8-K dated September 20, 2006 for more information).
(b) Reflects costs of certain legal and regulatory matters, including legal fees and settlement costs arising out of the civil complaint relating to market service agreements and other issues filed against MMC and Marsh by the New York State Attorney General in October 2004 and settled in January 2005; and market-timing and other issues at Putnam. Regulatory expenses in Risk and Insurance Services include fees for professional services provided by other MMC companies; the resulting inter-company balances are eliminated in Corporate. The credits for Investment Management represent insurance recoveries relating to previously expensed legal fees.
(c) Reflects costs to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts paid by the Putnam mutual funds in previous years. The previous payments were cost reimbursements by the Putnam mutual funds to Putnam for transfer agency services related to defined contribution operations.
A noteworthy item affecting 2005 net income was the $34 million prepayment penalty related to a mortgage refinancing of MMC's headquarters building in New York, recorded as interest expense.
Interest Expense.
The year-over-year comparability of MMC's fourth quarter and twelve-month financial results is affected by MMC's adoption, effective July 1, 2005, of SFAS 123(R) ("Share Based Payment"). Stock option expense for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $23 million: Risk and Insurance Services - $9 million, Risk Consulting & Technology - $0 million, Consulting - $9 million, Investment Management - $3 million, Corporate - $2 million. Stock option expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $116 million: Risk and Insurance Services - $47 million, Risk Consulting & Technology - $2 million, Consulting - $41 million, Investment Management - $14 million, Corporate - $12 million. A charge of $33 million and $64 million for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, respectively, is reflected in Corporate results.
Stock Option Expense.
In Risk and Insurance Services, noteworthy items and stock option expense together totaled $218 million for the twelve months of 2006, affecting segment operating margin by 4 percentage points. Noteworthy items totaled $435 million for twelve months of 2005, affecting segment operating margin by 7.7 percentage points. Adjusting for these impacts, the segment's adjusted operating income was $895 million and adjusted operating margin was 16.4 percent for the twelve months of 2006, compared to adjusted operating income of $740 million and an adjusted operating margin of 13.2 percent for the twelve months of 2005. The adjusted operating income and adjusted segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. MMC believes that presenting these measures may help investors and others understand aspects of Risk and Insurance Services operating performance that may not be apparent from MMC's reported GAAP results. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for MMC's reported GAAP information, and may not be comparable to similar information provided by industry peers.
