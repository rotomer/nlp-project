MMC REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2007 RESULTS
Consolidated Revenues Increased 5 Percent to $2.8 Billion
Income from Continuing Operations Rose 14 Percemt
$500 Million Share Repurchase Program Is Announced
 
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, May 8, 2007Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter were $2.8 billion, an increase of 5 percent from the first quarter of 2006, or 1 percent on an underlying basis. Income from continuing operations rose 14 percent to $228 million, or $.41 per share, from $200 million, or $.36 per share last year.
 
 
"The first quarter demonstrated the strength of MMC as a diversified company," said Michael G. Cherkasky, president and chief executive officer of MMC. "We met our overall corporate performance expectations while we continued to position Marsh for success in the future. The consulting segment continued to perform very well, growing revenues 13 percent and operating income 22 percent on a business with annual revenues
 
 
approaching $4.5 billion. Kroll performed as expected, with strong growth in its largest operation, technology-enabled solutions. Guy Carpenter produced solid results, driven by continued strong new business. Marsh made significant strides in executing the realignment of its operations, repositioning the business for long-term growth. Change always has a short-term cost, but we are confident we are making the right trade-offs in Marsh. Also in the first quarter, we announced that Great-West Lifeco, a subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, agreed to purchase Putnam for $3.9 billion in cash. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. In recognition of MMC's improving operating performance and greatly strengthened financial position, MMC's Board of Directors has approved a $500 million share repurchase program, which we expect to execute promptly."
 
Risk and Insurance Services
Risk and insurance services revenues in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, an increase of 1 percent from the first quarter of 2006, or a 2 percent decline on an underlying basis.
 
Marsh's revenues were $1.1 billion, unchanged from the first quarter of 2006. Geographically, Marsh revenues included $540 million in the Americas, a decline of 5 percent from the prior year's quarter; $524 million in EMEA, an increase of 3 percent; and $78 million in Asia Pacific, an increase of 12 percent. New business increased 7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting growth of 5 percent in the Americas, 8 percent in EMEA, and 17 percent in Asia Pacific. Premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace continued through the first quarter. Underlying revenues declined 3 percent in the quarter, primarily due to lower retention rates in the United States.
 
Guy Carpenter's revenues increased 4 percent in the first quarter to $292 million, driven by 11 percent growth in new business. These results were achieved despite the decline in U.S. property catastrophe rates from the peak levels seen in the mid-year 2006 renewal season and higher risk retention by clients. Underlying revenues increased 2 percent in the quarter.

Risk Capital Holdings recognized revenues of $49 million in the first quarter, compared with $46 million in the same period of 2006. Revenues in the quarter were derived from MMC's private equity fund investments.
 
Risk Consulting and Technology
Kroll's revenues increased 1 percent in the first quarter to $235 million and were flat on an underlying basis. The technology-enabled solutions business increased revenues 14 percent to $132 million, due to continued strong performance in background screening and growth in the electronic discovery business. Kroll's consulting business saw revenues decline 12 percent to $103 million, reflecting the expected level of activity in corporate advisory and restructuring.
 
Consulting
Consulting revenues increased 13 percent to $1.1 billion in the first quarter, with 7 percent growth on an underlying basis.
 
Mercer Human Resource Consulting increased revenues 8 percent to $800 million in the first quarter, with a 4 percent on an underlying basis. This growth was achieved throughout Mercer HR's operations: retirement and investment produced $319 million in revenues, an increase of 11 percent; health and benefits, $183 million, the same level as last year; outsourcing, $176 million, an increase of 13 percent; and talent, $99 million, an increase of 6 percent.
 
Mercer Specialty Consulting's revenues grew 25 percent to $329 million in the first quarter, with a 15 percent on an underlying basis, continuing the strong growth this group has achieved over the last four years. Each of the Mercer Specialty companies contributed to this exceptional performance.
 
Discontinued Operations
Due to the agreement to sell Putnam, announced on February 1, 2007, Putnam's results for both years are now reflected in discontinued operations. Results from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $40 million, or $.06 per share, in the first quarter of 2007,

reflecting Putnam's results for the quarter, compared with $.39 per share last year, primarily due to a $.32 gain from the sale of Sedgwick Claims Managaement Services.
 
In the first quarter, Putnam had revenues of $356 million, an increase of 3 percent from the first quarter of 2006. Putnam's assets under management on March 31, 2007 were $188 billion, comprising $119 billion in mutual fund assets and $69 billion in institutional assets. Average assets under management were $189 billion, compared with $190 billion for the first quarter of 2006.
