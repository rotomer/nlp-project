MMC REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2007 RESULTS
 
Consolidated Revenue Increases 10 Percent to $2.8 Billion
Significant Gain on Sale of Putnam Investments
 
NEW YORK, November 8, 2007  Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007.
 
In the quarter, consolidated revenue was $2.8 billion, up 10 percent from the third quarter of 2006, or 6 percent on an underlying basis. Income from continuing operations was $80 million, or $.15 per share, compared with $133 million, or $.24 per share, last year. Discrete tax items negatively impacted earnings per share from continuing operations by $.04 in the current year quarter.
 
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.9 billion, or $3.45 per share, compared with $43 million, or $.07 per share, last year. These results reflect the gain on the sale of Putnam Investments on August 3, 2007, as well as $.02 per share attributable to Putnam's operations in July 2007.
 
Net income was $1.9 billion, or $3.60 per share, compared with $176 million, or $.31 per share, last year. Noteworthy items, described in the attached supplemental schedules, reduced earnings per share by $.04 in the third quarter of 2007, compared with a reduction of $.06 in the third quarter of 2006.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, consolidated revenue of $8.4 billion increased 7 percent from $7.8 billion in the year-ago period, or 3 percent on an underlying basis. Income from continuing operations was $448 million, or $.81 per share, a decrease of 3 percent from $464 million, or $.84 per share, in the year-ago period. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.9 billion, or $3.50 per share, compared with $300 million, or $.52 per share, last year, reflecting gains on the Putnam transaction in the third quarter of 2007 and the sale of Sedgwick Claims Management Services in the first quarter of 2006. Net income was $2.4 billion, or $4.31 per share, compared with $764 million, or $1.36 per share, last year.
 
"Despite continued strong performance in our consulting businesses, MMC's third-quarter results were significantly impacted by unacceptable financial performance in our insurance broking business. We have changed the leadership at Marsh and are taking comprehensive actions to improve profitability," said Michael G. Cherkasky, president and
chief executive officer of MMC. "New business in insurance and reinsurance broking compensated for extremely soft market conditions. Mercer and Oliver Wyman continued to perform at exceptional levels, producing strong revenue and earnings growth, while Kroll's underlying revenue growth was 11 percent."
 
Risk and Insurance Services
Risk and insurance services revenue in the third quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of 6 percent from the third quarter of 2006 or 2 percent on an underlying basis. Operating income declined in the quarter to $65 million from $143 million a year ago. Expenses rose in the quarter due to the effects of foreign exchange; incentive compensation accruals for professional staff at Marsh and incremental expenses relating to the departure of Marsh's former CEO; the effect of favorable professional liability experience in the third quarter of 2006; and costs associated with Marsh's advertising campaign initiated in the spring of 2007.
 
In the quarter, Marsh's revenue was $1 billion, up 3 percent from last year on a reported basis, and a decline of 1 percent on an underlying basis
.
Premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace continued to accelerate in the third quarter, contributing to a sequential quarterly decline in client retention rates. Geographically, revenue included $598 million in the Americas, an increase of 1 percent from the prior year; $345 million in EMEA, up 5 percent; and $96 million in Asia Pacific, an increase of 10 percent. Marsh's new business increased for the sixth consecutive quarter.
 
Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was $226 million, representing 5 percent growth from the prior year's quarter on a reported basis and 4 percent growth on an underlying basis. This growth, which was primarily due to continued strong new business, was achieved despite a significant decline in U.S. property catastrophe premium rates as well as higher risk retention by clients.

Risk Capital Holdings had revenue of $74 million in the third quarter, compared with $45 million in the same period of 2006. This revenue was predominantly due to higher mark-to-market gains arising from private equity investments. No investments were sold in the quarter.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, revenue for the risk and insurance services segment was $4.2 billion, an increase of 3 percent from the year-ago period. Marsh's revenue rose 1 percent from last year to $3.3 billion, and Guy Carpenter's revenue rose 4 percent to $735 million. Underlying revenue for the segment was unchanged from the prior year.
 
Consulting
MMC's consulting segment revenue grew 14 percent to $1.2 billion in the third quarter on a reported basis, and 9 percent on an underlying basis. The segment's operating income grew to $148 million from $112 million last year.
 
Mercer increased revenue 11 percent to $844 million in the third quarter, and 7 percent on an underlying basis. This growth was achieved throughout Mercer's operations: retirement and investment had $307 million of revenue, an increase of 13 percent; health and benefits, $197 million, or 4 percent growth; outsourcing, $187 million, grew 14 percent; and talent, $128 million, increased 11 percent.
 
The strong demand for consulting services offered by the Oliver Wyman Group continued for the fourth year in a row. Oliver Wyman grew revenue 23 percent to $374 million in the third quarter, or 17 percent on an underlying basis. Management, economic and brand consulting all produced double-digit revenue growth.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the consulting segment generated revenue of $3.6 billion, a 14 percent increase over last year. Mercer increased revenue by 10 percent to $2.5 billion, and Oliver Wyman grew revenue 25 percent to $1.1 billion.
 
Risk Consulting and Technology
Kroll's revenue was $260 million in the third quarter, an increase of 9 percent from the year-ago quarter, or 11 percent on an underlying basis. Operating income at Kroll was $31 million in the quarter, compared with $38 million last year. This decline was largely attributable to higher

compensation expense in the corporate advisory and restructuring business to retain key professional staff in anticipation of future increased activity.
 
Quarterly revenue in Kroll's technology operations increased 14 percent to $147 million, led by the Kroll Ontrack legal technology unit and Kroll's background screening business. Revenue in Kroll's consulting operations rose 4 percent, to $113 million.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, Kroll's revenue was $746 million, up 1 percent, or 2 percent on an underlying basis. Technology revenue increased 11 percent to $420 million, while consulting was down 9 percent to $326 million. The decline in Kroll's consulting revenue primarily reflects a significant reduction in client success fees for completed engagements compared to those received in 2006.
 
Other Items
On August 3, 2007, Great-West Lifeco, a financial holding company controlled by Power Financial Corp., completed its purchase of Putnam for $3.9 billion in cash. Following the tax payments on the transaction that MMC expects to make in the fourth quarter of 2007, the cash proceeds to MMC after minority interest should approach $2.5 billion.
 
MMC's tax rate on ongoing operations was 32 percent for the third quarter of 2007. The effective tax rate in the quarter primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes in certain international jurisdictions.
 
On August 24, 2007, MMC entered into an $800 million accelerated share repurchase transaction and received an initial 21 million shares of its common stock, with the remaining shares to be received upon the transaction's completion. In July 2007, MMC completed a previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction, under which it repurchased a total of 16 million shares. Primarily as a result of these two repurchase transactions, MMC's average diluted shares outstanding decreased from 558 million in the second quarter of 2007 to 540 million in the third quarter. A further reduction of average shares outstanding will occur in the fourth quarter.

MMC's cash position at the end of the third quarter was $2.8 billion, increasing from $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter. Debt decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.9 billion. These changes were primarily attributable to the receipt of proceeds from the Putnam transaction, partially offset by the funding of the $800 million share repurchase in the third quarter.
