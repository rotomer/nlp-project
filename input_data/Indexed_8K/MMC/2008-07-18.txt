Declassification of Board of Directors
 
The definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed by Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2008 included as Item 3 thereof an MMC-sponsored proposal to amend Article FIFTH of MMC's Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of declassifying MMC's Board of Directors. The proposed amendment was approved by the vote of stockholders at MMC's annual meeting of stockholders on May 15, 2008. Accordingly, on July 17, 2008, MMC filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment, amending Article FIFTH of MMC's Restated Certificate of Incorporation as proposed.
 
Elimination of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
 
At its meeting on July 17, 2008, MMC's Board of Directors approved the elimination of MMC's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, no shares of which had been issued. Accordingly, on July 17, 2008, MMC filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Elimination providing that all matters set forth in the certificate of designation with respect to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are eliminated from MMC's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
 
Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
On July 17, 2008, MMC filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a further Restated Certificate of Incorporation integrating in a single instrument the amendment to Article FIFTH and the Certificate of Elimination described above. A copy of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Guidelines for Corporate Governance
 
MMC's Board of Directors has adopted amendments to MMC's Guidelines for Corporate Governance (the "Guidelines"), effective July 17, 2008. Sections E.2 and E.5 of the Guidelines are amended to reflect the declassification of MMC's Board of Directors referred to in Item 5.03 above. The amendments also include other updating and clarifying revisions. The Guidelines, as amended, are available on MMC's corporate website at www.mmc.com.

provided
,
however
, that to the extent any committee of directors of the Corporation is lawfully entitled to exercise the powers of the Board of Directors, such committee may exercise any right or authority of the Board of Directors under this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
SIXTH:
          (a)       
Right to Indemnification
. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter, a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that, on or after the date of adoption of this new Article SIXTH, he or she is serving or had served as a director or officer of the Corporation or, while serving as such director or officer, is serving or had served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in any other capacity with respect to, another corporation or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter, an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
 
4
 
 
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be changed or amended (but, in the case of any such change or amendment, only to the extent that such change or amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by an indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators;
provided
,
however
, that except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter, an "advancement of expenses");
provided
,
however
, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter, an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter, a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article or otherwise.
(b)       
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
. If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
payments
by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (other than a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to the action. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
 
5
 
 
undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
(c)       
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
(d)       
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. The right to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
(e)       
Insurance
. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
(f)        
Limitation of Liability
. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this paragraph to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as also amended.
(g)       
Survival of Prior Indemnification Provisions: Effect of Subsequent Change on Existing Rights
. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as altering or eliminating the rights to indemnification existing, or based upon service by an indemnitee, prior to adoption of this new Article SIXTH. Any repeal or modification of this Article by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
SEVENTH:
   The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the laws of Delaware, and all rights and powers conferred herein upon stockholders and directors are granted subject to this reservation.
EIGHTH:
      (a) In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation, and except as otherwise expressly provided in Section (b) of this Article EIGHTH, a Business Transaction (as hereinafter defined)

or Associate of such Interested Stockholder shall require the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as hereinafter defined), voting together as a single class, excluding Voting Stock beneficially owned by such Interested Stockholder. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified, by law or otherwise.
(b)       The provisions of Section (a) of this Article EIGHTH shall not be applicable to any particular Business Transaction, and such Business Transaction shall require only such affirmative vote, if any, as is required by law or by any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation, or otherwise, if the Business Transaction shall have been approved, either specifically or as a transaction which is within an approved category of transactions, by a majority (whether such approval is made prior to or subsequent to the acquisition of, or announcement or public disclosure of the intention to acquire, beneficial ownership of the Voting Stock that caused the Interested Stockholder to become an Interested Stockholder) of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined).
 
7
 
 
stock) or five percent of the stockholders' equity (in the case of transactions in capital stock) of the entity in question (the "Substantial Part"), as reflected in the most recent fiscal year-end consolidated balance sheet of such entity existing at the time the stockholders of the Corporation would be required to approve or authorize the Business Transaction involving the assets, securities and/or commitments constituting any Substantial Part; or
 
 
 
 
 
8
 
 
 
 
 
 
9
 
 
recommended or elected to succeed the Disinterested Director by a majority of Disinterested Directors.
 
 
(d)       A majority of the Disinterested Directors shall have the power and duty to determine for the purposes of this Article EIGHTH on the basis of information known to them after reasonable inquiry, all questions arising under this Article EIGHTH, including, without limitation, (1) whether a person is
an Interested Stockholder, (2) the number of shares of Capital Stock or other securities beneficially owned by any person, (3) whether a person is an Affiliate or Associate of another, (4) whether a Proposed Action is with, or proposed by, or on behalf of an Interested Stockholder or an Affiliate or Associate of an Interested Stockholder, (5) whether the assets that are the subject of any Business Transaction have, or the consideration to be received for the issuance or transfer of securities by the Corporation or any Subsidiary in any Business Transaction has, an aggregate Fair Market Value of $10,000,000 or more, and (6) whether the assets or securities that are the subject of any Business Transaction constitute a Substantial Part. Any such determination made in good faith shall be binding and conclusive on all parties.
 
(e)       Nothing contained in this Article EIGHTH shall be
construed to relieve any Interested Stockholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.
 
(f)        For the purposes of this Article EIGHTH, a Business Transaction or any proposal to amend, repeal or adopt any provision of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article EIGHTH
(collectively, "Proposed Action") is presumed to have been proposed by, or
on behalf of, an Interested Stockholder or an Affiliate or Associate of an Interested Stockholder or a person who thereafter would become such if (1) after the Interested Stockholder became such, the Proposed Action is proposed following the election of any director of the
Corporation who with respect to such Interested Stockholder, would not qualify to serve as a Disinterested Director or (2) such Interested Stockholder, Affiliate, Associate or person votes for or consents to the adoption of any such Proposed Action, unless as to such Interested Stockholder, Affiliate, Associate or person a majority of the Disinterested Directors makes a
 
 
10
 
 
good faith determination that such Proposed Action is not proposed by or on behalf of such Interested Stockholder, Affiliate, Associate or person, based on information known to them after reasonable inquiry.
 
(g)       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified by law, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), any proposal to amend or repeal Article EIGHTH of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to amend, repeal or adopt any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article EIGHTH which is proposed by or on behalf of an Interested Stockholder or an Affiliate or Associate of an Interested Stockholder shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all the then outstanding
