(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the following statements set forth in the "Underwriting" section in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus: (i) the fourth paragraph relating to concessions and reallowances; (ii) the fifth sentence in the sixth paragraph thereunder relating to the Underwriters' statement that they do not intend to make a market in the Notes and (iii) the seventh, eighth and ninth paragraphs relating to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly
indemnified party
 
notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party failed to retain satisfactory counsel in a timely manner. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter and such control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a); and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnifying party
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in amount in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or if the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the
 
one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7(d) and 7(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (e) and subsection (d) above, to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Notes and not joint.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any termination of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any person controlling the Underwriters or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, its directors or any person controlling the Company and acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.

This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Representatives to the Company if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (a) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (b) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (c) a general
Termination
 
moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (d) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Representatives' judgment, is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a) through (d), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the Representatives' judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligations to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase at the Closing Date under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Notes on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of the Notes, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Notes which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to purchased on the Closing Date, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this
 
Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof, but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

This series of Notes is initially limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in said First Supplemental Indenture. This series of Notes and any Additional Notes of this series shall constitute one series for all purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation, amendments, waivers and redemptions. The terms and conditions of this series of Notes and any Additional Notes of this series (other than the issue price, the date of issuance, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Additional Notes and the first payment of interest following such issue date) shall be the same and shall bear the same CUSIP number.
Notes
Base Indenture
Trustee
Indenture
The Notes may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Issuer, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at then current Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points (the ""), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date. In case the Issuer shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Notes, the Issuer shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Notes to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder received the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Note designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Note.
Redemption Price
 
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the Redemption Price at which the Notes are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the Redemption Price of such Notes to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, upon presentation and surrender of such Notes, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue; except that interest shall continue to accrue on any such Note or portion thereof with respect to which the Issuer defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price and accrued interest. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Notes to be redeemed. In case any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such security, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Issuer shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000) or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of such Notes of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Notes to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the numbers of the Notes to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
The Issuer may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by its President or any Vice President, instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Notes for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Note, such notice to be in the name of the Issuer or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions stated herein.
Subject to Section 2.11 of the Base Indenture, the Issuer shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Notes selected for redemption and ending at the close
 
of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Notes so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any such Notes being redeemed in part.
If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Notes or portions of the Notes to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price, and interest on such Notes shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Redemption Price and accrued interest.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its option to redeem those Notes by notifying the holders thereof to that effect as described above, the Issuer shall make an offer (a "") to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000) or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes on the terms set forth below. In a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer shall offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (a ""). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Issuer shall mail a notice to holders of the Notes, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date that notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law (a ""). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date.
Change of Control Offer
Change of Control Payment
Change of Control Payment Date
On each Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful, accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered, and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased and that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture to the Change of Control Offer and to the repurchase by the Issuer of Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer have been complied with.
 
The Issuer shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions herein, the Issuer will comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions herein by virtue of any such conflict.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all of the series at the time Outstanding affected thereby (all such series voting together as a single class), as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Base Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holders of each Note then Outstanding and affected thereby (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, including the Notes, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected thereby (all such series voting together as a single class), to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Base Indenture, or established pursuant to the Base Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, including the Notes, in which case, each such affected series voting as a separate class. Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Base Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.
The Issuer is subject to certain covenants contained in the Indenture with respect to, and for the benefit of the holders of, the Notes. The Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Issuer's compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture or with respect to reports or other certificates filed under the Indenture;, , that nothing herein shall relieve the Trustee of any obligations to monitor the Issuer's timely delivery of all reports and certificates required under Section 5.03 of the Base Indenture and to fulfill its obligations under Article VII of the Indenture. If an Event of Default as defined in the Indenture with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
provided
however
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or Trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes (in the case of an Event of Default described in clauses (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of Section 6.01 of the Base Indenture, each such series voting as a separate class, and in the case of an Event of Default described in clauses (a)(iii), (a)(iv), (a)(v) or (a)(vi) of Section 6.01 of the Base Indenture, all affected series voting together as a single class) shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding (voting as provided in Section 6.01 (b) of the Base Indenture) a direction inconsistent with such request. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any interest on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable by the registered holder hereof on the Security Register of the Issuer, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuer in the borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer or the Trustee duly executed by the registered
 
holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Issuer, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Issuer or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in authorized denominations. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations herein and therein set forth, Notes so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
THE INDENTURE AND THE NOTES INCLUDING THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
