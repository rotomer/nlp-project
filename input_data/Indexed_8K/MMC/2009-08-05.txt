MMC REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
 
Continued Strong Performance in Risk and Insurance Services
 
NEW YORK
, August 5, 2009  Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
 
"MMC performed well in the second quarter despite the continued difficult economic environment affecting our businesses. Results for our Risk and Insurance Services segment were excellent. Underlying revenue rose 2 percent, excluding fiduciary interest income. Strong growth in operating income drove a substantial improvement in margins," said MMC President and CEO Brian Duperreault.
 
"Marsh continued its excellent performance, achieving increased profitability through expense discipline. Guy Carpenter produced double-digit underlying revenue growth, reflecting strong new business, with increased profitability resulting from its continuing focus on expenses. The operating margin for Risk and Insurance Services increased to 18.2 percent from 10.6 percent, and adjusted operating margin increased to 20.2 percent from 14.6 percent a year ago.
 
"In the Consulting segment, Mercer delivered a respectable performance in the current environment, with strong expense control offset by a modest revenue decline. At Oliver Wyman, we saw sequential improvement in profitability as a result of management actions taken earlier in the year.

"Overall, we have made excellent progress strengthening our operating companies while at the same time managing through the worst effects of the economic recession." Mr. Duperreault concluded.
 
In the second quarter of 2009, MMC's consolidated revenue was $2.6 billion, a decline of 13 percent from the second quarter of 2008, or 6 percent on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, using consistent currency exchange rates.
 
MMC completed the sale of its U.S. government security clearance screening business, Kroll Government Services, in the second quarter of 2009. Its results for the quarter are included in discontinued operations and the previous results of this business have been restated as discontinued operations. In connection with this transaction, MMC evaluated Kroll's overall goodwill for impairment. This resulted in a non-cash charge of $315 million, or $.60 per share. There is no tax benefit related to the impairment charge, nor any impact on MMC's cash flows, tangible equity or debt covenants.
 
As a result of the goodwill impairment charge, MMC reported a net loss of $193 million, or $.37 per share, in the second quarter. This compared with net income of $65 million, or $.12 per share, in the second quarter of 2008.
 
Earnings per share on an adjusted basis, which excludes noteworthy items as presented in the attached supplemental schedules, was $.33 in the second quarter of 2009, compared with $.39 in the same quarter last year.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, MMC's net loss was $17 million, or $.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $145 million, or $.28 per share, last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the six months was $.72, compared with $.84 last year.
 
Risk and Insurance Services
Risk and Insurance Services segment revenue in the second quarter of 2009 was $1.3 billion, a decline of 5 percent from the second quarter of 2008, and was flat on an underlying basis. Excluding fiduciary interest, underlying revenue in Risk and Insurance Services rose 2 percent. Operating income in the second quarter increased 63 percent

to $245 million from $150 million last year. Adjusted operating income rose 31 percent to $271 million from $207 million, reflecting substantially improved performance at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the first six months of 2009, segment revenue was $2.7 billion, a decline of 7 percent from the prior year period, and flat on an underlying basis. Excluding fiduciary interest, underlying revenue increased 1 percent.
 
In the second quarter, insurance premiums in the property and casualty marketplace continued to decline  similar to what was seen earlier in the year. Additionally, the global economic recession reduced demand for commercial insurance. Marsh's revenue in the second quarter declined 7 percent from last year to $1.1 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue was flat in the quarter. Revenue for international operations was flat overall, with modest growth in Asia Pacific and 9 percent growth in Latin America. Marsh achieved a significant increase in profitability in the quarter as a result of its substantial reduction in expenses.
 
Guy Carpenter's revenue rose 16 percent to $227 million in the second quarter of 2009, or 11 percent on an underlying basis, compared with the prior year's quarter. An increase in new business along with continuing cost discipline led to significant improvement in Guy Carpenter's profitability. Increased rates were evident in U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance in the second quarter, while rates in casualty reinsurance were stable to down. In the second quarter, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates.
 
Consulting
Due to the impact of continued adverse global economic conditions, consulting segment revenue declined 17 percent to $1.1 billion in the second quarter, or 9 percent on an underlying basis. Operating income in the second quarter of 2009 was $96 million. This includes an increase in professional liability costs of approximately $30 million, primarily reflecting a legal settlement at Mercer. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income by $26 million in the quarter, primarily at Mercer. Adjusted operating income, which includes the impact of both the professional liability costs and foreign exchange, was $101 million, compared with $165 million in 2008. For the first six months of 2009, segment revenue declined 17 percent to $2.2 billion, or 8 percent on an underlying basis.

Mercer's revenue declined 13 percent to $832 million in the second quarter, or 5 percent on an underlying basis. Mercer's consulting operations produced revenue of $605 million, a decline of 5 percent on an underlying basis, with modest reductions in its retirement and health and benefits businesses. Outsourcing, with revenue of $154 million, declined 5 percent, and investment consulting and management, with revenue of $73 million, increased 2 percent. Oliver Wyman's revenue declined 25 percent to $311 million in the second quarter of 2009, or 19 percent on an underlying basis.
 
Risk Consulting and Technology
Kroll's revenue of $161 million in the second quarter of 2009 declined 29 percent from the year-ago quarter, or 24 percent on an underlying basis. Revenue in litigation support and data recovery declined 29 percent; background screening was down 9 percent; and risk mitigation and response decreased 33 percent.
 
Other Items
As a result of mark-to-market declines within MMC's private equity fund investments, an investment loss of $31 million was reported in the second quarter of 2009.
 
At June 30, 2009, cash and cash equivalents was $1.3 billion. MMC repaid its $400 million, 7.125 percent senior notes due June 15, 2009 with the net proceeds from its debt issuance of March 15, 2009. MMC also declared a quarterly dividend of $.20 per share on outstanding common stock, payable in the third quarter of 2009.
