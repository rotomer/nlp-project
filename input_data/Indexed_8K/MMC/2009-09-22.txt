    Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter, a "
proceeding
"), by reason of the fact that, on or after May 21, 1987, he or she is serving or had served as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or, while serving as such director, officer or employee, is serving or had served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in any other capacity with respect to, another corporation or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter, an "
indemnitee
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be changed or amended (but, in the case of any such change or amendment, only to the extent that such change or amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by an indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators;
provided
, that except as provided in Section 6.03 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to
 
- 15 -
 
 
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI shall be a contract right.
 
SECTION
6.02.
  
Advancement of Expenses.
    An indemnitee who is a director or officer of the Corporation, and any other indemnitee to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, shall have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter, an "
advancement of expenses
");
provided
, that if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter, an "
undertaking
"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter, a "

    If a claim under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days (in the case of Section 6.01) or 20 days (in the case of Section 6.02) after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (
i
) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (other than a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses), it shall be a defense that, and (
ii
) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to the action. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified,

SECTION
6.05. Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
    The right to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire pursuant to law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, contractual agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
 
SECTION
6.06. Insurance.

SECTION
6.07. Survival of Prior Indemnification Provisions; Effect of Subsequent Change on Existing Rights.
    Nothing contained in this Article VI shall be construed as altering or eliminating the rights to indemnification existing, or based upon service by an indemnitee, prior to May 21, 1987.
