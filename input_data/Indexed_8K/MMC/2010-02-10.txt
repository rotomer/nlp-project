NEW YORK
, February 10, 2010  Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.
 
Brian Duperreault, MMC President and CEO said: "I am very pleased with our company's performance in 2009 and the excellent progress we made executing our goals for the year. MMC is much stronger today than it was a year ago. Our marked improvement in adjusted operating income in 2009 was driven by very strong performance in Risk and Insurance Services, with substantial margin improvement.
 
"I am particularly pleased with our fourth quarter results since each of our operating segments achieved double-digit growth in adjusted operating income.
 
"Marsh had an outstanding year, implementing operational improvements to enhance profitability. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent year, as solid new business development and expense discipline resulted in strong growth in revenue and profitability.

"While our Consulting segment was most directly affected by the economic environment in 2009, our businesses were well-managed during the period. Mercer took appropriate steps throughout the year to protect profitability and had an excellent fourth quarter with very strong growth in adjusted operating income. Oliver Wyman saw sequential improvement in quarterly profitability as a result of management actions taken during the year.
 
"Kroll also made excellent progress streamlining its business in 2009 and achieved stronger operating performance over the second half of the year. The improvement was driven primarily by Kroll's largest business, Ontrack. It had a particularly good fourth quarter; as a result, Kroll's adjusted operating income grew substantially compared with the prior year.
 
"MMC's operations are very well-positioned entering 2010. We have confidence in the ability of our business leaders and their teams to continue to provide our clients with the best service and solutions and to grow profitability for our shareholders," Mr. Duperreault concluded.
