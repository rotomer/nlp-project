Item 1.01                      Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 6, 2010, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Altegrity, Inc. (Altegrity), a portfolio company of Providence Equity Partners.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, which has been approved by the respective boards of directors of MMC and Altegrity, MMC will sell to Altegrity (the Stock Sale) 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MMCs indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Kroll Inc. (together with its direct or indirect subsidiaries, Kroll) for approximately $1.13 billion in cash (the Purchase Price).  The Purchase Price is subject to customary adjustment based on Krolls working capit al.
 
The Stock Sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010.  There are no material relationships between MMC or its affiliates and Altegrity, other than with respect to the transaction described herein.
 
Conditions to Completion of the Stock Sale
 
The obligation of each of MMC and Altegrity to consummate the Stock Sale is conditioned on:
 
 
The obligation of Altegrity to consummate the Stock Sale is subject to the following additional conditions:
 
 
Termination of the Purchase Agreement
 
The parties may terminate the Purchase Agreement prior to the closing by mutual written consent.  In addition, each party may terminate the Purchase Agreement prior to the closing:
 
 
 
 
2 
 
 
In addition, MMC may terminate the Purchase Agreement if all the conditions to the obligation of Altegrity to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied or waived and Altegrity fails to consummate the Stock Sale within three business days following the date the closing should have occurred pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
 
Effect of Termination
 
In the event of the termination of the Purchase Agreement as provided above, the Purchase Agreement will become void and, except in the case of any material breach of the Purchase Agreement or a termination by MMC as provided in the following paragraph, there will be no liability on the part of any party to the Purchase Agreement, except that certain provisions will survive any such termination.
 
If MMC terminates the Purchase Agreement because of an uncured Altegrity breach of its covenants or agreements or failure to be true of its representations or warranties, or because of Altegritys failure to consummate the Stock Sale within three business days following the date the closing should have occurred pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Altegrity will pay MMC a termination fee, and MMCs receipt of such termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of MMC against Altegrity, its financing sources and their respective related parties.
 
Financing Obligations
 
Altegrity has obtained financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which, together with other financial resources of Altegrity, will be sufficient for Altegrity to pay the Purchase Price.  Two investment funds affiliated with Providence Equity Partners have committed to provide financing for the Stock Sale on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a sponsor commitment letter dated June 6, 2010 (the Sponsor Commitment Letter) and have provided MMC with a limited guarantee in favor of MMC dated June 6, 2010 (the Limited Guarantee) guaranteeing (on a several basis) the payment of any termination fee that may become payable by Altegrity.  An affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Apollo Investment Corporation have each committed to provide debt financing for the Stock Sale pursuant to their respective debt commitment letters dated June 6, 2010 (the Debt Commitment Letters).
 
Altegrity has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as is necessary, proper or advisable to obtain financing for the payment of the Purchase Price on the terms and conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain in effect the Sponsor Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letters, (b) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the debt financing on terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (c) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are applicable to the financing in the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive financing agreements, as applicable, and comply with its obligations thereunder, (d) obtain such third-party consents as may be reasonably required in connection with the finan cing, (e) upon the
 
 
 
3 
 
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, consummate the financing at or prior to the closing and (f) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive financing agreements, as applicable, in the event of a breach by the financing sources that impedes or delays the closing, including seeking specific performance by the parties thereunder.  In furtherance of obtaining such financing, MMC has also agreed to cause Kroll, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Altegrity in connection with the financing.
 
If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive financing agreements, the Purchase Agreement requires Altegrity to promptly notify MMC and use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same and/or alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Altegrity than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters in an amount sufficient to consummate the Stock Sale as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
 
Representations and Warranties
 
MMC has made customary representations and warranties regarding, among other things: incorporation, qualification and corporate authority of MMC and Kroll; Krolls capital structure; the absence of certain conflicts; consents and regulatory approvals; financial statements; absence of undisclosed liabilities; absence of certain changes or events; absence of certain litigation; compliance with laws; governmental licenses and permits; intellectual property; environmental matters; material contracts; employment and employee benefit matters; real property; insurance; tax matters; affiliate transactions; brokers fees; and material customers.
 
Altegrity has made customary representations and warranties regarding, among other things: incorporation, qualification and corporate authority; the absence of certain conflicts; consents and regulatory approvals; absence of restraints; compliance with laws; securities matters; availability of financing; solvency; execution, delivery and enforceability of the Limited Guarantee; absence of certain equity interests in similar businesses; and brokers fees.
 
Many of the representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement are qualified by a materiality or material adverse effect standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect). For purposes of the Purchase Agreement, a material adverse effect means any change, event or development that has had a material adverse effect on or with respect to the business, financial condition or continuing results of operations of Kroll, taken as a whole, subject to certain customary exclusions.
 
The representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement generally survive for eighteen months after the closing date.

MMC has undertaken customary covenants in the Purchase Agreement restricting the conduct of Krolls business between the date of the Purchase Agreement and the closing.

MMC has also agreed that, for a period of thirty months from the closing date, none of MMC or its subsidiaries will, either directly or indirectly as a stockholder, investor, member, partner or otherwise, own, manage, operate or engage in any business in the United States providing (a) electronic discovery and data recovery services, (b) pre-employment background screening services, or (c) mortgage screening services, in each case of the type provided by Kroll as of the date of the Purchase Agreement.  The foregoing restriction does not apply to services of a nature provided by MMC or its subsidiaries other than Kroll as of the date of the Purchase Agreement, and reasonable extensions thereof, and is subject to other specified exceptions (including the purchase or ownership of an entity that derives less than 15% of its total an nual revenues or $20 million in annual revenues from a competitive business and passive holdings of publicly traded securities).

Each of the parties has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all necessary governmental/regulatory approvals, to take all such actions as may be requested by any such governmental authority to obtain such approvals, and to avoid the entry of a Governmental Order, including by making an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act within ten business days of the date of the Purchase Agreement, and not extending any waiting period under the HSR Act or entering into any agreement with a governmental authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party.
