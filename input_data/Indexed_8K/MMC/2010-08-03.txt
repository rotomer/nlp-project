, August 3, 2010  Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010.
NEW YORK
 
Brian Duperreault, MMC President and CEO said: We are pleased with the progress MMC made in the second quarter. Our Risk and Insurance Services segment grew revenue in an environment of continued soft market conditions in the property and casualty marketplace. Marsh produced strong new business globally, with especially good revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.  Guy Carpenter generated underlying revenue growth, reflecting new business production. In our Consulting segment, Mercer continued to control expenses in a weak economic environment. We were also pleased with the growth in revenue and operating income generated by Oliver Wyman.
 
The sale of Kroll will allow us to concentrate on our Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting businesses. We look forward to pursuing our objectives for future growth and to unlocking the potential of MMC as a strategic enterprise, Mr. Duperreault concluded.
