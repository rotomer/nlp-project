On August 3, 2010, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC") completed the previously reported sale (the "Stock Sale") to Altegrity, Inc. ("Altegrity") of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MMC's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Kroll Inc. (together with its direct or indirect subsidiaries, "Kroll") pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 6, 2010 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and between MMC and Altegrity. There are no material relationships between MMC or its affiliates and Altegrity, other than in respect of the Stock Sale.
MMC received net cash proceeds at the closing of the Stock Sale of approximately $1.13 billion, before taking into account a preliminary adjustment based on Kroll's estimated working capital at closing.
MMC classified Kroll as a discontinued operation in the second quarter of 2010. This classification is reflected in MMC's unaudited consolidated income statements for the three month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, as set forth in MMC's Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. MMC's unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements and related descriptions of pro-forma adjustments and notes are attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. This pro forma information is intended to provide investors with information about how the Stock Sale might have affected MMC's historical financial position and results of operations.
The foregoing summary of certain terms of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to MMC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2010, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On August 3, 2010, MMC issued a press release announcing the closing of the Stock Sale. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. specified in Article 11 of Regulation S-X are attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
Note 1  Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the impact of the dispositions of Kroll Inc. and Kroll Laboratory Specialists ("Kroll") on MMC's operating results. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2010 is based on historical statements of MMC as of March 31, 2010, adjusted to reflect the impact of the disposition of the Kroll operations as if it had occurred on March 31, 2010. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 are based on the historical financial statements of MMC for such periods after giving effect to the Kroll disposition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2009. The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with MMC's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in MMC's 2009 Annual Report of Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2010, and MMC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010, filed on May 7, 2010.
The preparation of the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is based on financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the use of estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations would have been had the transactions occurred on the respective date assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the Company's future operating results. However, the pro forma adjustments reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflect estimates and assumptions that the Company's management believes to be reasonable.
