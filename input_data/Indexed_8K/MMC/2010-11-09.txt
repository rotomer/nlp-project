NEW YORK
 
Brian Duperreault, MMC President and CEO, said: We are pleased with the progress our company has made, not only in the third quarter but throughout the year. In the quarter, all four of our Operating Companies produced strong underlying revenue growth, the first time this has occurred since 2007.
 
The Risk and Insurance Services segment grew revenue in an environment of continued soft market conditions in the property and casualty marketplace. Marsh produced strong new business globally, with revenue growth across all geographic regions. Guy Carpenter generated excellent revenue growth, reflecting new business production and high retention rates. In our Consulting segment, we were pleased with  the revenue growth at Oliver Wyman.  Mercer achieved a marked improvement in revenue, with growth in each of its businesses -- consulting, outsourcing, and investment management.
