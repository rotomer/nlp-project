NEW YORK
 
Brian Duperreault, President and CEO, said: Our performance in the first quarter of 2011 reflects strong revenue growth across all of our operating companies. Excellent results for Risk and Insurance Services reflect underlying revenue growth at Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Marshs revenue growth was across all geographies, driven by continued high levels of new business development and client retention. Guy Carpenters superior results were led by international operations, with the company producing its ninth consecutive quarter of underlying revenue growth.
 
Our Consulting segment produced strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Mercers underlying revenue growth reflects the continued fine performance of its consulting and investments businesses. Oliver Wymans impressive revenue growth was led by double- digit increases in a number of its industry sectors.
 
Our first quarter results build on the momentum the Company achieved last year. As recently announced, we have made changes to our senior management team and are

These appointments underscore the breadth and depth of talent on our leadership team and position us well for future growth, concluded Mr. Duperreault.
