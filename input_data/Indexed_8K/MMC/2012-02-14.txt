As part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies.

Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits from the resolution of certain legal matters and related insurance recoveries, as well as credits from the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters.

(herein referred to as the "Marsh BPO" business). Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient. During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale. In the fourth quarter of 2011, clients of the Marsh BPO business were notified of the decision to sell the business and actions were taken by management to facilitate the sale. As a result, the company wrote off capitalized software of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations.
