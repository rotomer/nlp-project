ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE BUSINESS SEGMENTS Supplemental Unaudited New Business Segments Reporting Effective January 1, 2003: As more fully described in 3M's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in September 2002, 3M announced it would strategically realign its organization for faster growth and a closer focus on markets and customers. This realignment resulted in seven reportable business segments compared to the current structure of six reportable business segments. These structural changes were driven by 3M's strategic planning process and represent an important step toward access to its larger and faster-growing markets. Executive vice president appointments were effective October 1, 2002, but a three-month transition period was provided to realign the existing organization to the new structure. Internal management reporting for the new reportable business segments commenced January 1, 2003. 3M provided in its "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section in its 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K supplemental financial information related to these new business segments on an annual basis. This information was provided on a supplemental basis as the company did not operate under this new structure for these periods, and has only operated under this new structure since January 1, 2003. 3M is including in this Current Report on Form 8-K supplemental unaudited financial information on both an annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflecting the historical realigned segments. This supplemental financial information is being provided for the respective years to show the results on an interim basis for the realigned segments. The company did not operate under the realigned segments structure for any of these periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.
As more fully described and consistent with the information provided in 3M's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, all periods presented reflect the January 1, 2002, adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." This adoption resulted in a reclassification of approximately $25 million of advertising expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales for 2001 and 2000, with no impact on operating income. This reclassification resulted in a reduction in both advertising expenses and net sales for these years. Operating income in 2002 included restructuring charges recorded in Corporate and Unallocated of $202 million ($148 million in the second quarter, and $54 million in the first quarter). Operating income in 2001 included net charges of $504 million ($15 million in the fourth quarter, $69 million in the third quarter, $397 million in the second quarter, and $23 million in the first quarter) related to the restructuring plan, acquisition-related costs, a reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual, and a gain related to the net impact of the sale and write-down of available-for-sale equity securities. These net charges were recorded in Corporate and Unallocated, except for acquisition-related costs in the first quarter that totaled $23 million ($10 million recorded in Health Care; $7 million in Display and Graphics; and $6 million in Electro and Communications). Operating income in 2000 included net losses of $23 million ($74 million loss in the fourth quarter, a $1 million net gain in the third quarter, and a $50 million gain in the first quarter). This included $168 million related to the company's phase-out of perfluorooctanyl-based chemistry products (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated), a $20 million write-down of corporate and unallocated assets, and $20 million of other charges ($13 million related to acquisitions in the Electro and Communications segment; $6 million in the fourth quarter and $7 million in the third quarter). Operating income gains in 2000 of $135 million were largely related to corporate and unallocated asset dispositions, principally the sale of available-for-sale equity securities. Operating income in the first quarter also included a $50 million gain from the termination of a product distribution agreement in the Health Care segment.
