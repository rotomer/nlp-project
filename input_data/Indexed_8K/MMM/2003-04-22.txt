C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report: April 21, 2003 (Date of earliest event reported) 3M COMPANY (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) File No. 1-3285 (Commission File Number) Delaware 41-0417775 (State of incorporation) (I.R.S. Employer Identification Number) 3M Center 55144-1000 St. Paul, Minnesota (Zip Code) (Address of principal executive offices) Registrant's telephone, including area code: (651) 733-1110 ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE The information contained in this Current Report, which is intended to be furnished under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition," is instead being furnished under Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure" pursuant to interim guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Release Nos. 33-8216 and 34-47583. As such, the information hereunder shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discloses non-GAAP results that exclude special items. The company will continue to provide reconciliations of its disclosed non-GAAP financial reporting to the most comparable GAAP reporting. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. Earnings per share and other amounts before special items are not measures recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The press release follows.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 3M REPORTS HIGHER FIRST-QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS; REVENUES INCREASE 11.0 PERCENT TO A RECORD $4.32 BILLION ST. PAUL, MINN. -- April 21, 2003 -- 3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced its sales and earnings results for first quarter 2003.

Excluding special items(a), 3M earned $1.42 per share, up 15.4 percent from $1.23 per share in last year's first quarter. Net income, excluding special items(a), was $560 million versus $487 million in the comparable quarter. "The entire 3M team is energized by this quarter's results," said W. James McNerney, Jr., 3M chairman and CEO. "3Mers everywhere are driving our global corporate initiatives across the company and achieving both improved productivity and accelerated top-line growth." Worldwide sales in the first quarter totaled $4.318 billion, 11.0 percent higher than in the year-earlier quarter.

Volumes also increased in Latin America by 17.5 percent, whereas volumes declined 1.1 percent in Europe. "As everyone knows, geo-political and economic conditions remain highly uncertain," McNerney said. "Despite these conditions, we remain committed to achieving our top-line and profitability goals while driving higher cash flow and preserving a strong and healthy balance sheet."

3M Company and Subsidiaries BUSINESS SEGMENTS (Unaudited) As more fully described in 3M's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in September 2002, 3M announced it would strategically realign its organization for faster growth and a closer focus on markets and customers. This realignment resulted in seven reportable business segments compared to the previous structure of six reportable business segments. These structural changes were driven by 3M's strategic planning process and represent an important step toward access to its larger and faster-growing markets. Internal management reporting for the new reportable business segments commenced January 1, 2003. 3M provided in its "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section in its 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K supplemental financial information related to these new business segments on an annual basis. This information was provided on a supplemental basis as the company did not operate under this new structure for these periods, and has only operated under this new structure since January 1, 2003. 3M filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on April 4, 2003, that provided supplemental unaudited financial information on both an annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflecting the historical realigned segments. This supplemental financial information was provided for the respective years to show the results on an interim basis for the realigned segments. Results under the new structure for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 follow.
