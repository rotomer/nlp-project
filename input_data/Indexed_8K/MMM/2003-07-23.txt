Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 3M Delivers Record Second-Quarter Earnings; Sales Increase 10.1 Percent to $4.6 Billion, An All-Time High ST. PAUL, Minn. -- July 21, 2003 -- 3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced its sales and earnings results for second quarter 2003. The company reported net income of $619 million, or $1.56 per share, versus $466 million, or $1.18 per share, in the second quarter of 2002. Excluding special items(a) in the second quarter of 2002, net income increased 14.8 percent from $539 million last year, and earnings per share increased 14.7 percent from $1.36 per share in last year's second quarter. "Our employees did a terrific job in the second quarter," said W. James McNerney, Jr., 3M chairman and CEO. "Sales reached an all-time high, and both net income and earnings per share were the highest of any second quarter in 3M's 100-year-plus history. Our corporate initiatives -- aimed at driving higher top-line growth, productivity and free cash flow -- are making a real difference in 2003." Worldwide sales in the second quarter totaled $4.580 billion, 10.1 percent higher than in the year-earlier quarter. Sales volumes increased 5.6 percent, including a positive 1.8 percent impact from acquisitions. Volumes increased 21.9 percent in Display and Graphics (includes 9 percent from acquisitions), 11.0 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 7.1 percent in Transportation, 5.6 percent in Health Care, 3.0 percent in Consumer and Office and 0.1 percent in Industrial.

"Clearly, it is prudent to maintain a cautious outlook on global economic growth and to gear our plans accordingly," McNerney said.

By driving higher and sustainable sales growth, extending productivity improvements and generating cash flow to fuel growth, 3M can continue to deliver high-quality results into the future."
