ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On October 20, 2003, 3M Company issued a press release reporting its earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 (furnished hereunder as Exhibit 99.1). The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discloses non-GAAP results that exclude special items. The company will continue to provide reconciliations of its disclosed non-GAAP financial reporting to the most comparable GAAP reporting. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. Earnings per share and other amounts before special items are not measures recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. 3M COMPANY By: /s/ Gregg M.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 3M THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS RISE 20.3 PERCENT TO $0.83 PER SHARE; SALES INCREASE 11.4 PERCENT TO A RECORD $4.62 BILLION ST. PAUL, MINN. -- October 20, 2003 -- 3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced its sales and earnings results for third quarter 2003. Net income for the quarter was $663 million, or $0.83 per share, versus $545 million, or $0.69 per share, in the third quarter of 2002. Net income and per-share earnings increased 21.6 percent and 20.3 percent, respectively (a). "Our employees are connecting with customers like never before," said W. James McNerney, Jr., 3M chairman and CEO, "and those connections are reflected in our third-quarter results. Sales reached an all-time high for the third consecutive quarter, boosted by sales volume increases in 6 of our 7 businesses, and we achieved 20 percent-plus increases in both net income and earnings per share." Third-quarter worldwide sales totaled $4.616 billion, up 11.4 percent compared to the third quarter of 2002. Sales volumes increased 7.8 percent, including a positive 2.0 percent impact from acquisitions. Volumes increased 33.6 percent in Display and Graphics (includes 12 percent from acquisitions), 9.3 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 6.8 percent in Health Care, 5.0 percent in Consumer and Office, 3.9 percent in Transportation and 0.2 percent in Industrial. Volumes declined 2.6 percent in Electro and Communications. Currency translation effects increased worldwide sales by 3.9 percent while selling prices were down 0.3 percent. Sales outside the United States totaled $2.629 billion, an increase of 18.0 percent versus last year's comparable quarter. Volumes increased 11.5 percent, while selling prices declined 0.7 percent. Currency translation effects increased international sales by 7.2 percent. Volumes increased 22.3 percent in Asia Pacific, 21.2 percent in Latin America and 0.9 percent in Europe. In the United States, sales totaled $1.987 billion, up 3.7 percent from the same quarter of 2002. Volumes increased 3.6 percent, while selling prices improved by 0.1 percent. "The collective power of our five corporate initiatives -- Six Sigma, 3M Acceleration, e-Productivity, Global Sourcing and Indirect Cost Reduction -- continues to drive better 3M results," McNerney said. "We're focused on accelerating growth in all of our businesses, and maintaining strict cost discipline throughout the company. We are confident in our ability to sustain sales, earnings and cash momentum despite the ongoing uncertainties in the global marketplace." 3M also provided its earnings outlook for the remainder of 2003. The company expects fourth-quarter earnings to be between $0.73 and $0.75 per share. As a result, 3M raised its expectations for full-year 2003 earnings to a range of $2.98 to $3.00 per share on a reported basis. Excluding special items (b), 3M expects 2003 earnings to be between $3.05 and $3.07 per share.
