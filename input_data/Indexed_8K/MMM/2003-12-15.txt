Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Securities directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby (i) appoints each Agent as an agent of the Company for the purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof and (ii) agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever it determines to sell Securities directly to any Agent as principal, it will enter into a separate agreement (each a "Terms Agreement"), substantially in the form of Annex I hereto, relating to such sale in accordance with Section 2(b) hereof.

(a) On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each of the Agents hereby severally and not jointly agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and receive offers to purchase the Securities from the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented from time to time (including the Pricing Supplement), and to deliver the Prospectus as amended or supplemented from time to time (including the Pricing Supplement) to all purchasers of the Securities as set forth in the Administrative Procedure (as hereinafter defined). So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to any Agent, the Company may, without requiring the consent of or payment of commissions to such Agent, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any debt securities with a maturity at the time of original issuance of 9 months to 30 years. The Company reserves the right to sell, and may solicit and accept offers to purchase, Securities directly on its own behalf, and, in the case of any such sale not resulting from a solicitation made by any Agent, no commission will be payable with respect to such sale. These provisions shall not limit Section 4(f) hereof or any similar provision included in any Terms Agreement. Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Securities, the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities and the payment in each case therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure attached hereto as Annex II as it may be amended from time to time by written agreement between the Agents and the Company (the "Administrative Procedure"). The 6
provisions of the Administrative Procedure shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder other than those made pursuant to a Terms Agreement. Each Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them in the Administrative Procedure. The solicitation of offers to purchase Securities will be made in a manner consistent with such reasonable guidelines developed from time to time by the Company as agreed with the Agents. The Company will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Administrative Procedure as from time to time in effect. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities. As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day in New York City, after receipt of notice from the Company, the Agents will suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed. During such period, the Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k). Upon advising the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed, however, the Company shall simultaneously provide the documents required to be delivered by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k), and the Agents shall have no obligation to solicit offers to purchase the Securities until such documents have been received by the Agents. In addition, any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations to deliver the documents required by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k) shall automatically suspend the Agents' obligations hereunder, including without limitation its obligations to solicit offers to purchase the Securities hereunder as agent or to purchase Securities hereunder as principal, until such time as the documents required to be delivered by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k) are received by the Agents. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, at the time of settlement of any sale of a Security by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to the following applicable percentage of the principal amount of such Security sold: Commission (percentage of aggregate principal Range of Maturities amount of Securities sold) ------------------- -------------------------- From 9 months to less than 1 year.......... .125% From 1 year to less than 18 months......... .50% From 18 months to less than 2 years........ .200% From 2 years to less than 3 years.......... .250% From 3 years to less than 4 years.......... .350% From 4 years to less than 5 years.......... .450% From 5 years to less than 6 years.......... .500% From 6 years to less than 7 years.......... .550% From 7 years to less than 10 years......... .600% From 10 years to less than 15 years........ .625% From 15 years to less than 20 years........ .675% 20 years and more.......................... .750% 7
The Agents may offer the Securities they have purchased as principal to other dealers. The Agents may sell Securities to any dealer at a discount and such discount allowed to any dealer may include all or part of the discount to be received by such Agents from the Company. (b) Each sale of Securities to any Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless the Company and such Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement which will provide for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase thereof by, such Agent. A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Securities by such Agent. The commitment of any Agent to purchase Securities as principal, whether pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of Securities to be purchased by any Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company for such Securities, any provisions relating to rights of, and default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of the Securities and the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for such Securities. Such Terms Agreement shall also specify any requirements for opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Each Agent proposes to offer Securities purchased by it as principal for sale at prevailing market prices or prices related thereto at the time of sale, which may be equal to, greater than or less than the price at which such Securities are purchased by such Agent from the Company. For each sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of such Securities and payment therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure. For each such sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company agrees to pay such Agent a commission (or grant an equivalent discount) as provided in Section 2(a) hereof and in accordance with the schedule set forth therein. Each time and date of delivery of and payment for Securities to be purchased by an Agent as principal, whether set forth in a Terms Agreement or in accordance with the Administrative Procedure, is referred to herein as a "Time of Delivery". (c) Each Agent agrees, with respect to any Security denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, as agent, directly or indirectly, not to solicit offers to purchase, and as principal under any Terms Agreement or otherwise, directly or indirectly, not to offer, sell or deliver, such Security in, or to residents of, the country issuing such currency, except as permitted by applicable law. 3. The documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6 hereof on the Commencement Date (as defined below) shall be delivered to the Agents at the offices of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of this Agreement, which date and time of such delivery may be postponed by agreement between the Agents and the Company but in no event shall be later than the day prior to the date on which solicitation of offers to purchase Securities is commenced or on which any Terms Agreement is executed (such time and date being referred to herein as the "Commencement Date"). 8
4. The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent: (a) (i) To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (A) prior to the Commencement Date which shall be reasonably disapproved by any Agent promptly after reasonable notice thereof or (B) after the date of any Terms Agreement or other agreement by an Agent to purchase Securities as principal and prior to the related Time of Delivery which shall be reasonably disapproved by any Agent party to such Terms Agreement or so purchasing as principal promptly after reasonable notice thereof; (ii) to prepare, with respect to any Securities to be sold through or to such Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Pricing Supplement with respect to such Securities in a form previously approved by such Agent and to file such Pricing Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act; (iii) to make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, other than any Pricing Supplement, at any time prior to having afforded each Agent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on it; (iv) to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such time period to advise such Agent, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or has become effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus (other than any Pricing Supplement that relates to Securities not purchased through or by such Agent) has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and (v) in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any such prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal; (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as such Agent reasonably may request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution or sale of the Securities; provided, however, that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; (c) To furnish such Agent with copies of the Registration Statement and each amendment thereto, with copies of the Prospectus as each time amended or supplemented, other than any Pricing Supplement (except as provided in the Administrative Procedure), in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, and with copies of the documents incorporated by reference therein, all in such quantities as such Agent may reasonably request from time to time; and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities (including Securities purchased from the Company by such Agent as principal) and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a 9
result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to immediately notify such Agent and request such Agent, in its capacity as agent of the Company, to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company (and, if so notified, such Agent shall cease such solicitations as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day later); and if the Company shall decide to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, to so advise such Agent promptly by telephone (with confirmation in writing) and to prepare and cause to be filed promptly with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; provided, however, that if during such same period such Agent continues to own Securities purchased from the Company by such Agent as principal or such Agent is otherwise required to deliver a prospectus in respect of transactions in the Securities, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the Commission such an amendment or supplement; (d) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158) by making an appropriate filing with the Commission if the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or by other means if the Company is not so subject; (e) So long as any Securities are outstanding, to furnish to such Agent copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders, and deliver to such Agent (i) as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which any class of securities of the Company is listed; and (ii) such additional information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company as such Agent may from time to time reasonably request (such financial statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission); (f) That, from the date of any Terms Agreement with such Agent or other agreement by such Agent to purchase Securities as principal and continuing to and including the later of (i) the termination of the trading restrictions for the Securities purchased thereunder and (ii) the related Time of Delivery (provided that such Agent shall notify the Company if such trading restrictions will not terminate on the related Time of Delivery), the Company will not, without the prior written consent of such Agent, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company (other than the sale of Securities pursuant to such Terms Agreement) which both mature more than 9 months after such Time of Delivery and are substantially similar to the Securities; 10
(g) That each acceptance by the Company of an offer to purchase Securities hereunder (including any purchase by such Agent as principal not pursuant to a Terms Agreement), and each execution and delivery by the Company of a Terms Agreement with such Agent, shall be deemed to be an affirmation to such Agent that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement are true and correct as of the date of such acceptance or of such Terms Agreement, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such date, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct as of the settlement date for the Securities relating to such acceptance or as of the Time of Delivery relating to such sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such date (except that such representations and warranties shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented relating to such Securities); (h) That reasonably in advance of each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement) and each time a document filed under the Act or the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each time the Company sells Securities to such Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an opinion or opinions by Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel to the Agents, as a condition to the purchase of Securities pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish to such counsel such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to furnish to such Agent the opinion or opinions referred to in Section 6(b) hereof; (i) That each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement), each time a document filed under the Act or the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus and each time the Company sells Securities to such Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an opinion under this Section 4(i) as a condition to the purchase of Securities pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to such Agent a written opinion of Gregg Larson, Assistant General Counsel of the Company, or other counsel for the Company satisfactory to such Agent, dated the date of such amendment, supplement, incorporation or Time of Delivery relating to such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect that such Agent may rely on the opinion of such counsel referred to in Section 6(c) hereof which was last furnished to such Agent to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that the statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such date) or, in lieu of such opinion, an opinion of the same tenor as the opinion of such counsel referred to in Section 6(c) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such date; (j) That each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement which does not set forth financial information included in or derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements or accounting records) and each time that a document filed under the Act or the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, in either case to set forth financial information included in or derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements or accounting records, and each time the Company sells Securities to such Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement and 11
such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of a letter under this Section 4(j) as a condition to the purchase of Securities pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall cause the independent certified public accountants who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement forthwith to furnish such Agent a letter, dated the date of such amendment, supplement, incorporation or Time of Delivery relating to such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to such Agent, of the same tenor as the letter referred to in Section 6(d) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company, to the extent such financial statements and other information are available as of a date not more than five business days prior to the date of such letter; provided, however, that, with respect to any financial information or other matter, such letter may reconfirm as true and correct at such date as though made at and as of such date, rather than repeat, statements with respect to such financial information or other matter made in the letter referred to in Section 6(d) hereof which was last furnished to such Agent; (k) That each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement), each time a document filed under the Act or the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each time the Company sells Securities to such Agent as principal and the applicable Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of a certificate under this Section 4(k) as a condition to the purchase of Securities pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to such Agent a certificate, dated the date of such supplement, amendment, incorporation or Time of Delivery relating to such sale, as the case may be, in such form and executed by such officers of the Company as shall be satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 6(g) hereof which was last furnished to such Agent are true and correct at such date as though made at and as of such date (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such date), or, in lieu of such certificate, certificates of the same tenor as the certificates referred to in said Section 6(g) but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such date; and (l) To offer to any person who has agreed to purchase Securities as the result of an offer to purchase solicited by such Agent the right to refuse to purchase and pay for such Securities if, on the related settlement date fixed pursuant to the Administrative Procedure, any condition set forth in Section 6(a), 6(e) or 6(f) hereof shall not have been satisfied (it being understood that the judgment of such person with respect to the impracticability or inadvisability of such purchase of Securities shall be substituted, for purposes of this Section 4(l), for the respective judgments of an Agent with respect to certain matters referred to in such Sections 6(a), 6(e) and 6(f), and that such Agent shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to exercise the judgment permitted under such Sections 6(a), 6(e) and 6(f) on behalf of any such person). 5. The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any 12
Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Pricing Supplements and all other amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to such Agent; (ii) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agents in connection with the establishment of the program contemplated hereby, any opinions to be rendered by such counsel hereunder and the transactions contemplated hereunder; (iii) the cost of printing, preparing by word processor or reproducing this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Indenture, any Blue Sky Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iv) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 4(b) hereof, including fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (v) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (vi) any filing fees incident to any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vii) the cost of preparing the Securities; (viii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee and any agent of any Trustee and any transfer or paying agent of the Company and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee or such agent in connection with any Indenture and the Securities; (ix) any advertising connected with the solicitation of offers to purchase and the sale of Securities so long as such advertising expenses have been approved by the Company; and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. Except as provided in Sections 7 and 8 hereof, each Agent shall pay all other expenses it incurs. 6. The obligation of any Agent, as agent of the Company, at any time ("Solicitation Time") to solicit offers to purchase the Securities and the obligation of any Agent to purchase Securities as principal, pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall in each case be subject, in such Agent's discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and covenants of the Company herein (and, in the case of an obligation of an Agent under a Terms Agreement, in or incorporated in such Terms Agreement by reference) are true and correct at and as of the Commencement Date and any applicable date referred to in Section 4(k) hereof that is prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, and at and as of such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the condition that prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) (i) With respect to any Securities sold at or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement) with respect to such Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and (iii) all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of such Agent; (b) Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel to the Agents, shall have furnished to such Agent (i) such opinion or opinions, dated the Commencement Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Securities, the Registration 13

validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and the shares of each such Significant Subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the Company are owned free and clear of all such liens, encumbrances, equities or claims, except, with respect to joint venture subsidiaries, for such liens, encumbrances, equities or liens which do not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (v) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings, which, if determined adversely, would individually or in the aggregate have such a Material Adverse Effect, are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; (vi) This Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (vii) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by the Company, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles, and subject further, as to enforcement, to any requirements that a claim with respect to any debt securities issued under the Indenture that are payable in a foreign or composite currency (or a foreign or composite currency judgment in respect to such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or by governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States; and the Indenture conforms and the Securities will conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (viii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles, and subject further, as to enforcement, to any requirements that a claim with respect to any debt securities issued under the Indenture that are payable in a foreign or composite currency (or a foreign or composite currency judgment in respect to such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or by governmental authority 15
to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; (ix) The issue and sale of the Securities by the Company, the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company or the By-Laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; (x) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities, the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the solicitation by the Agents of offers to purchase Securities from the Company and with purchases of Securities by an Agent as principal, as the case may be, in each case in the manner contemplated hereby; (xi) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is (i) in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation (or Articles of Incorporation) or By-laws or (ii) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound that is described or referred to in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, if such default would result in a Material Adverse Effect; (xii) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes We Offer", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, and under the captions "United States Taxation", "Plan of Distribution" and "Supplemental Plan of Distribution", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are correct in all material respects; (xiii) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities, will not be an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act; 16
(xiv) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements or data and related schedules included therein, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed not misleading; and (xv) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements or data and related schedules included therein or the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead him to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than financial statements or data and related schedules included therein or the Form T-1, as to which such counsel makes no statement) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that, as of the date of such opinion, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements or data and related schedules included therein, as to which such counsel makes no statement) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required. (d) Not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Commencement Date and on each applicable date referred to in Section 4(j) hereof that is on or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the independent certified public accountants who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to such Agent a letter, dated the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto; 17
(e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, that would result in a Material Adverse Effect, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of such Agent so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation by such Agent of offers to purchase Securities from the Company or the purchase by such Agent of Securities from the Company as principal, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, provided, however, that in the case where any Agent purchases Securities as principal, the references to the "Prospectus as amended or supplemented" in clauses (i) and (ii) shall refer to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement); (f) There shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets of the United States or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or the declaration of a national emergency or war if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of such Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities or the purchase of Securities from the Company as principal, pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or otherwise, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (v) any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; or (vi) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; and (g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to such Agent certificates of officers of the Company dated the Commencement Date and each applicable date referred to in Section 4(k) hereof that is on or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, in such form and executed by such officers of the Company as shall be satisfactory to such Agent, as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, as to the matters 18
set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section 6, and as to such other matters as such Agent may reasonably request. 7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein. (b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with 19
counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect 20
thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Securities purchased by or through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 8. Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other than in respect to any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that solicited such offer any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale. 9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties, covenants and other statements, if any, by any Agent and the Company set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Company, or any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities. 10. The provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company as to any Agent or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such suspension or termination to such Agent or the Company, as the case may be. In the event of such suspension or termination with respect to any Agent, (x) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has not 21
occurred, (y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued or which relate to Securities which are already issued, agreed to be issued or the subject of a pending offer at the time of such suspension or termination and (z) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar as the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), Section 4(d), Section 4(e), Section 5, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof are concerned. 11. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Administrative Procedure, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Agents shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to:

Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC (the "Agents") on the other, to issue and sell to [Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC] the securities specified in the Schedule hereto (the "Purchased Securities"). Each of the provisions of the Distribution Agreement not specifically related to the solicitation by the Agents, as agents of the Company, of offers to purchase Securities is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and shall be deemed to be part of this Terms Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein. Nothing contained herein or in the Distribution Agreement shall make any party hereto an agent of the Company or make such party subject to the provisions therein relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company, solely by virtue of its execution of this Terms Agreement. Each of the representations and warranties set forth therein shall be deemed to have been made at and as of the date of this Terms Agreement, except that each representation and warranty in Section 1 of the Distribution Agreement which makes reference to the Prospectus shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty as of the date of the Distribution Agreement in relation to the Prospectus (as therein defined), and also a representation and a warranty as of the date of this Terms Agreement in relation to the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to relate to the Purchased Securities. Annex I-1
An amendment to the Registration Statement, or a supplement to the Prospectus, as the case may be, relating to the Purchased Securities, in the form heretofore delivered to you is now proposed to be filed with the Commission. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Distribution Agreement incorporated herein by reference, the Company agrees to issue and sell to [Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P.

No action taken pursuant to this paragraph above shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Terms Agreement, either the nondefaulting Agents or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.] Annex I-2

ANNEX II 3M COMPANY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE This Administrative Procedure relates to the Securities defined in the Distribution Agreement, dated December 12, 2003 (the "Distribution Agreement"), between 3M Company (the "Company") and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC (together, the "Agents"), to which this Administrative Procedure is attached as Annex II. Defined terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Distribution Agreement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or the Indenture. The procedures to be followed with respect to the settlement of sales of Securities directly by the Company to purchasers solicited by an Agent, as agent, are set forth below. The terms and settlement details related to a purchase of Securities by an Agent, as principal, from the Company will be set forth in a Terms Agreement pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, unless the Company and such Agent otherwise agree as provided in Section 2(b) of the Distribution Agreement, in which case the procedures to be followed in respect of the settlement of such sale will be as set forth below. An Agent, in relation to a purchase of a Security by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a Security by such Agent as principal other than pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the "Purchasing Agent". The Company will advise each Agent in writing of those persons with whom such Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Securities and the related settlement details. Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be represented by either a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary (a "Book-Entry Security") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificated Security") delivered to a person designated by an Agent, as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be entitled to receive a certificate representing such a Security, except as provided in the Indenture. Book-Entry Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure set forth in Part I hereof, and Certificated Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure set forth in Part II hereof. PART I: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Securities for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representation from the Company and the Trustee to the Depositary, dated the date hereof, and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Annex II-1
Trustee and the Depositary, dated as of October 31, 1988 (as amended from time to time, the "Certificate Agreement"), and its obligations as a participant in the Depositary, including the Depositary's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS"). POSTING RATES BY THE COMPANY: The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Book-Entry Securities that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent. The Company may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an offering period ("posting"). If the Company decides to change already posted rates, it will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the new posted rates have been established with the Agents. ACCEPTANCE OF OFFERS BY THE COMPANY: Each Agent will promptly advise the Company by telephone or other appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities, other than those rejected by such Agent. Each Agent may, in its discretion reasonably exercised, reject any offer received by it in whole or in part. Each Agent also may make offers to the Company to purchase Book-Entry Securities as a Purchasing Agent. The Company will have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. The Company will promptly notify the Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of its acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities. If the Company accepts an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities, it will confirm such acceptance in writing to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and the Trustee. COMMUNICATION OF SALE INFORMATION TO THE COMPANY BY AGENT AND SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES: A. After the acceptance of an offer by the Company, the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, will communicate promptly, but in no event later than the time set forth under "Settlement Procedure Timetable" below, the following details of the terms of such offer (the "Sale Information") to the Company by telephone (confirmed in writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means: (1) Principal Amount of Book-Entry Securities to be purchased; (2) If a Fixed Rate Book-Entry Security, the interest rate and initial interest payment date; (3) Trade Date; (4) Settlement Date; (5) Maturity Date; Annex II-2
(6) Specified Currency and, if the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars, the applicable Exchange Rate for such Specified Currency (it being understood that currently the Depositary accepts deposits of Global Securities denominated in U.S. dollars only); (7) Indexed Currency, the Base Rate and the Exchange Rate Determination Date, if applicable; (8) Issue Price; (9) Selling Agent's commission or Purchasing Agent's discount, as the case may be; (10) Net Proceeds to the Company; (11) If a redeemable Book-Entry Security, such of the following as are applicable: (i) Redemption Commencement Date, (ii) Initial Redemption Price (% of par), and (iii) Amount (% of par) that the Redemption Price shall decline (but not below par) on each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date; (12) If a Floating Rate Book-Entry Security, such of the following as are applicable: (i) Interest Rate Basis, (ii) Index Maturity, (iii) Spread or Spread Multiplier, (iv) Maximum Rate, (v) Minimum Rate, (vi) Initial Interest Rate, (vii) Interest Reset Dates, (viii) Calculation Dates, (ix) Interest Determination Dates, (x) Interest Payment Dates, (xi) Regular Record Dates, and (xii) Calculation Agent; (13) Denomination of certificates to be delivered at settlement; (14) Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent; and (15) Any other terms. B. After receiving the Sale Information from the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, the Company will communicate such Sale Information to the Trustee by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means. The Trustee will assign a CUSIP number to the Global Security from a list of CUSIP numbers previously delivered to the Trustee Annex II-3
by the Company representing such Book-Entry Security and then advise the Company and the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of such CUSIP number. C. The Trustee will enter a pending deposit message through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, providing the following settlement information to the Depositary, and the Depositary shall forward such information to such Agent and Standard & Poor's Corporation: (1) The applicable Sale Information; (2) CUSIP number of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security; (3) Whether such Global Security will represent any other Book-Entry Security (to the extent known at such time); (4) Number of the participant account maintained by the Depositary on behalf of the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be; (5) The interest payment period; and (6) Initial Interest Payment Date for such Book-Entry Security, number of days by which such date succeeds the record date for the Depositary's purposes (which in the case of Floating Rate Securities which reset weekly shall be the date five calendar days immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date and in the case of all other Book-Entry Securities shall be the Regular Record Date, as defined in the Security) and, if calculable at that time, the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date. D. The Trustee will complete and authenticate the Global Security previously delivered by the Company representing such Book-Entry Security. E. The Depositary will credit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account at the Depositary. F. The Trustee will enter an SDFS deliver order through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System instructing the Depositary to (i) debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and credit such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and (ii) debit such Agent's settlement account and credit the Trustee's settlement account for an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security less such Agent's commission. The entry of such a deliver order shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Trustee to the Depositary that (a) the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security has been issued and authenticated and (b) the Trustee is holding such Global Security pursuant to the Certificate Agreement. G. Such Agent will enter an SDFS deliver order through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System instructing the Depositary (i) to debit such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and credit such Book-Entry Security to the participant accounts of the Participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security and (ii) to debit the settlement accounts Annex II-4
of such Participants and credit the settlement account of such Agent for an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security. H. Transfers of funds in accordance with SDFS deliver orders described in Settlement Procedures "F" and "G" will be settled in accordance with SDFS operating procedures in effect on the settlement date. I. Upon confirmation of receipt of funds, the Trustee will transfer to the account of the Company maintained at Citibank, N.A., New York, or such other account as the Company may have previously specified to the Trustee, in funds available for immediate use in the amount transferred to the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedure "F". J. Upon request, the Trustee will send to the Company a statement setting forth the principal amount of Book-Entry Securities outstanding as of that date under the Indenture. K. Such Agent will confirm the purchase of such Book-Entry Security to the purchaser either by transmitting to the Participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security a confirmation order or orders through the Depositary's institutional delivery system or by mailing a written confirmation to such purchaser. L. The Depositary will, at any time, upon request of the Company or the Trustee, promptly furnish to the Company or the Trustee a list of the names and addresses of the participants for whom the Depositary has credited Book-Entry Securities. PREPARATION OF PRICING SUPPLEMENT: If the Company accepts an offer to purchase a Book-Entry Security, it will prepare a Pricing Supplement reflecting the terms of such Book-Entry Security and arrange to have delivered to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, at least ten copies of such Pricing Supplement, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Trade Date (as defined below), or if the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on the Business Day following the date of acceptance of such offer, not later than noon, New York City time, on such date.

In addition, the Selling Agent will deliver to such purchaser or its agent the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement) in relation to such Book-Entry Security prior to or together with the earlier of the delivery to such purchaser or its agent of (a) the confirmation of sale or (b) the Book-Entry Security. DATE OF SETTLEMENT: The receipt by the Company of immediately available funds in payment for a Book-Entry Security and the authentication and issuance of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security shall constitute "settlement" with respect to such Book-Entry Security. All orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company on a particular date (the "Trade Date") will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is the third Business Day after the Trade Date pursuant to the Annex II-7
"Settlement Procedure Timetable" set forth below, unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on another Business Day which shall be no earlier than the next Business Day after the Trade Date. SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE TIMETABLE: For orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent and accepted by the Company for settlement on the third Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "A" through "I" set forth above shall be completed as soon as possible but not later than the respective times (New York City time) set forth below: SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE TIME - -------------------- ---- A 5:00 p.m. on the Trade Date B 12:00 noon on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date C 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date D 9:00 a.m. on the Settlement Date E 10:00 a.m. on the Settlement Date F-G 2:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date H 4:45 p.m. on the Settlement Date I 5:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date If the initial interest rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry Security has not been determined at the time that Settlement Procedure "A" is completed, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date. Settlement Procedure "H" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the Settlement Date. If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or canceled, the Trustee, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participation Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement Date. FAILURE TO SETTLE: If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry Security pursuant to Settlement Procedure "F", the Trustee may deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing the Depositary to debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account, provided that the Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be debited. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will mark such Global Security "canceled", make appropriate entries in the Trustee's records and send such canceled Global Security to the Company. The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP Annex II-8
Service Bureau procedures, be canceled and not immediately reassigned. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities and shall be canceled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Securities previously represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Security. If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in the Depositary, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Book-Entry Security may enter deliver orders through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to such participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's account and then debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and shall notify the Company and the Trustee thereof. Thereafter, the Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order and the Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited to the account of the Company maintained at the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedure I, and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph. If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Security, the Depositary may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect. In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedure "D", for the authentication and issuance of a Global Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its records. The Company will, from time to time, furnish the Trustee with a sufficient quantity of Securities.

Except as provided in the next paragraph, any payment to be made on this Security in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars will be made in U.S. dollars if the Person entitled to receive such payment transmits a written request for such payment to be made in U.S. dollars to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, on or before the tenth day before the payment is to be made. Such written request may be mailed, hand delivered, telecopied or delivered in any other manner approved by the Trustee. Any such request made with respect to any payment on this Security payable to a particular Holder will remain in effect for all later payments on this Security payable to such Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the tenth day before a payment is to be made, in which case such revocation shall be effective for such and all later payments. In the case of any payment of interest payable on an Interest Payment Date, such written request must be made by the Person who is the registered Holder of this Security on the relevant Regular Record Date. The U.S. dollar amount of any payment made pursuant to the preceding paragraph will be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent based upon the highest bid quotation received by the Exchange Rate Agent as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date, from three (or, if three are not available, then two) recognized foreign exchange dealers selected by the Exchange Rate Agent in The City of New York, in each case for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for U.S. dollars and for settlement on such payment date of an amount of the Specified Currency for such payment equal to the aggregate amount of such Specified Currency payable on such payment date to all Holders of Securities of this or any other series who elect to receive U.S. dollar payments on such payment date, and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.

All currency exchange costs associated with any payment in U.S. dollars on this Security will be borne by the Holder entitled to receive such payment, by deduction from such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount payable on this Security is payable on any day (including at Maturity) in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, and if such Specified Currency is not available to the Company on the two Business Days before such day, due to the imposition of exchange controls, disruption in a currency market or any other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligation to pay such amount in such Specified Currency by making such payment in U.S. dollars. The amount of such payment in U.S. dollars shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the noon buying rate for cable transfers in The City of New York for such Specified Currency (the "Exchange Rate") as of the latest day before the day on which such payment is to be made. Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in other than U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture or this Security. 4

Payment of any amount payable on this Security in U.S. dollars will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in The City of New York, if (i) the principal of this Security is at least $1,000,000 and (ii) the Holder entitled to receive such payment transmits a written request for such payment to be made in such manner to the Paying Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Citibank Agency & Trust Services, on or before the tenth day before the day on which such payment is to be made; provided that, in the case of any such payment due at the Maturity of the principal hereof (other than any payment of interest that first becomes due on an Interest Payment Date), this Security must be surrendered at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York (or at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose) in time for the Paying Agent to make such payment in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Any such request made with respect to any payment on this Security payable to a particular Holder will remain in effect for all later payments on this Security payable to such Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the tenth day before a payment is to be made, in which case such revocation shall be effective for such and all later payments. In the case of any payment of interest payable on an Interest Payment Date, such written request must be made by the Person who is the registered Holder of this Security on the relevant Regular Record Date. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in connection with making payments by wire transfer with respect to this Security, but any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon any payment will be borne by the Holder of this Security and may be deducted from the payment by the Company or the Paying Agent.

Such account designation shall be made by transmitting the appropriate information to the Paying Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Citibank Agency & Trust Services, by mail, hand 5

If a payment in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars with respect to this Security cannot be made by wire transfer because the required account designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before the requisite date or for any other reason, the Company will cause a notice to be given to the Holder of this Security at its registered address requesting an account designation pursuant to which such wire transfer can be made and such payment will be made within five Business Days after the Paying Agent's receipt of such a designation meeting the requirements specified above, with the same force and effect as if made on the due date. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in connection with making payments by wire transfer with respect to this Security, but any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon any payment will be borne by the Holder of this Security and may be deducted from the payment by the Company or the Paying Agent.

The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to this Security in lieu of the provisions of Section 113 of the Indenture. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

SERIES AND DENOMINATIONS This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any other currency or currencies or currency units), which amount may be increased at the option of the Company if in the future it determines that it may wish to sell additional Securities of this series. References herein to "this series" mean the series of securities designated on the face hereof. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in "Authorized Denominations", which term shall have the following meaning. For each Security of this series having a principal amount payable in U.S. dollars, the Authorized Denominations shall be $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.

(b) EXCHANGE RATE AGENT. The Company has initially appointed the institution named on the face of this Security as Exchange Rate Agent, to act as such agent with respect to this Security, but the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint any other institution (including any Affiliate of the Company) to serve as such agent from time to time. The Company will give the Trustee prompt written notice of any change in any such appointment. Insofar as this Security provides for any such agent to obtain rates, quotes or other data from a bank, dealer or other institution for use in making any determination hereunder, such agent may do so from any institution or institutions of the kind contemplated hereby notwithstanding that any one or more of such institutions are any such agent, Affiliates of any such agent or Affiliates of the Company. All determinations made by the Exchange Rate Agent may be made by such agent in its sole discretion and, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Security and the Company.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. 10.

3M Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, as principal the Principal Amount on the Stated Maturity Date and to pay interest thereon, from the Original Issue Date or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on the Interest Payment Date(s) in each year, commencing on the first such date that is at least 15 calendar days after the Original Issue Date, and at the Maturity of the principal hereof, at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3 on the reverse hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Any premium and any such installment of interest that is overdue at any time shall also bear interest (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), at the rate per annum at which the principal then bears interest, from the date any such overdue amount first becomes due until it is paid or made available for payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest on any principal, premium or installment of interest that is overdue shall be payable on demand. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a Business Day, as such term is defined in Section 3(n) on the reverse hereof) next preceding such Interest Payment Date (a "Regular Record Date"). Any interest so payable, but not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and such Defaulted Interest either may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. CURRENCY OF PAYMENT Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made in the Specified Currency for such payment, except as provided in this and the next three paragraphs. The Specified Currency for any payment shall be the currency specified as such on the face of this Security unless, at the time of such payment, such currency is not legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such currency on the Original Issue Date, in which case the Specified Currency for such payment shall be such coin or currency as at the time of such payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in such country, except as provided in the next sentence. If the euro is specified on the face of this Security as the Specified Currency for any payment, the Specified Currency for such payment shall be such coin or currency as at the time of payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in all EMU Countries (as defined in Section 3(n) on the reverse hereof), provided that, if on any day there are not at least two EMU Countries, or if on any day there are at least two EMU Countries but no coin or currency is legal tender for the payment of 4
public and private debts in all EMU Countries, then the Specified Currency for such payment shall be deemed not to be available to the Company on such day. Except as provided in the next paragraph, any payment to be made on this Security in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars will be made in U.S. dollars if the Person entitled to receive such payment transmits a written request for such payment to be made in U.S. dollars to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, on or before the tenth day before the payment is to be made. Such written request may be mailed, hand delivered, telecopied or delivered in any other manner approved by the Trustee. Any such request made with respect to any payment on this Security payable to a particular Holder will remain in effect for all later payments on this Security payable to such Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the tenth day before a payment is to be made, in which case such revocation shall be effective for such and all later payments. In the case of any payment of interest payable on an Interest Payment Date, such written request must be made by the Person who is the registered Holder of this Security on the relevant Regular Record Date. The U.S. dollar amount of any payment made pursuant to the preceding paragraph will be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent based upon the highest bid quotation received by the Exchange Rate Agent as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date, from three (or, if three are not available, then two) recognized foreign exchange dealers selected by the Exchange Rate Agent in The City of New York, in each case for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for U.S. dollars and for settlement on such payment date of an amount of the Specified Currency for such payment equal to the aggregate amount of such Specified Currency payable on such payment date to all Holders of Securities of this or any other series who elect to receive U.S. dollar payments on such payment date, and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If the Exchange Rate Agent determines that two such bid quotations are not available on such second Business Day, such payment will be made in the Specified Currency for such payment. All currency exchange costs associated with any payment in U.S. dollars on this Security will be borne by the Holder entitled to receive such payment, by deduction from such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount payable on this Security is payable on any day (including at Maturity) in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, and if such Specified Currency is not available to the Company on the two Business Days before such day, due to the imposition of exchange controls, disruption in a currency market or any other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligation to pay such amount in such Specified Currency by making such payment in U.S. dollars. The amount of such payment in U.S. dollars shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the noon buying rate for cable transfers in The City of New York for such Specified Currency (the "Exchange Rate") as of the latest day before the day on which such payment is to be made. Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in other than U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture or this Security. 5
MANNER OF PAYMENT - U.S. DOLLARS Except as provided in the next paragraph, payment of any amount payable on this Security in U.S. dollars will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York (or at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose), against surrender of this Security in the case of any payment due at the Maturity of the principal hereof (other than any payment of interest that first becomes due on an Interest Payment Date); provided, however, that, at the option of the Company and subject to the next paragraph, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. Payment of any amount payable on this Security in U.S. dollars will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in The City of New York, if (i) the principal of this Security is at least $1,000,000 and (ii) the Holder entitled to receive such payment transmits a written request for such payment to be made in such manner to the Paying Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Citibank Agency & Trust Services, on or before the tenth day before the day on which such payment is to be made; provided that, in the case of any such payment due at the Maturity of the principal hereof (other than any payment of interest that first becomes due on an Interest Payment Date), this Security must be surrendered at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York (or at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose) in time for the Paying Agent to make such payment in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Any such request made with respect to any payment on this Security payable to a particular Holder will remain in effect for all later payments on this Security payable to such Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the tenth day before a payment is to be made, in which case such revocation shall be effective for such and all later payments. In the case of any payment of interest payable on an Interest Payment Date, such written request must be made by the Person who is the registered Holder of this Security on the relevant Regular Record Date. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in connection with making payments by wire transfer with respect to this Security, but any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon any payment will be borne by the Holder of this Security and may be deducted from the payment by the Company or the Paying Agent.

Such account designation shall be made by transmitting the appropriate information to the Paying Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Citibank Agency & Trust Services, by mail, hand 6
delivery, telecopier or in any other manner approved by the Trustee. Unless revoked, any such account designation made with respect to this Security by the Holder hereof will remain in effect with respect to any further payments with respect to this Security payable to such Holder. If a payment in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars with respect to this Security cannot be made by wire transfer because the required account designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before the requisite date or for any other reason, the Company will cause a notice to be given to the Holder of this Security at its registered address requesting an account designation pursuant to which such wire transfer can be made and such payment will be made within five Business Days after the Paying Agent's receipt of such a designation meeting the requirements specified above, with the same force and effect as if made on the due date. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in connection with making payments by wire transfer with respect to this Security, but any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon any payment will be borne by the Holder of this Security and may be deducted from the payment by the Company or the Paying Agent.

The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to this Security in lieu of the provisions of Section 113 of the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face of this Security, the following sentence shall apply to each Interest Payment Date other than one that falls on the date of Maturity of the principal hereof. If any such Interest Payment Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, provided that, if the Base Rate is LIBOR or EURIBOR and the next succeeding Business Day would fall in the next calendar month, then such Interest Payment Date will be advanced to the next preceding Business Day. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

References herein to "this series" mean the series of securities designated on the face hereof. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in "Authorized Denominations", which term shall have the following meaning. For each Security of this series having a principal amount payable in U.S. dollars, the Authorized Denominations shall be $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. For each Security of this series having a principal amount payable in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the Authorized Denominations shall be the amount of such Specified Currency equivalent, at the Exchange Rate on the first Business Day next preceding the date on which the Company accepts the offer to purchase such Security, to $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. 3. INTEREST RATE (a) INTEREST RATE RESET. The interest rate on this Security will be reset from time to time, as provided in this Section 3, and each date upon which such rate is reset as so provided is hereinafter called an "Interest Reset Date". Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Interest Reset Dates with respect to this Security will be as follows: (i) if the Interest Reset Period is daily, each Business Day; (ii) if the Interest Reset Period is weekly and the Base Rate is not the Treasury Rate, the Wednesday of each week; (iii) if the Interest Reset Period is weekly and the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate, except as otherwise provided in the definition of "Treasury Interest Determination Date" in Section 3(n) below, the Tuesday of each week; 9
(iv) if the Interest Reset Period is monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; (v) if the Interest Reset Period is quarterly, the third Wednesday of each March, June, September and December; (vi) if the Interest Reset Period is semi-annual, the third Wednesday of each of two months in each year specified under "Interest Reset Period" on the face hereof; and (vii) if the Interest Reset Period is annual, the third Wednesday of the month in each year specified under "Interest Reset Period" on the face hereof; provided, however, that (x) the Base Rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to but excluding the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Base Rate and (y) if the Interest Reset Period is daily or weekly, the Base Rate in effect for each day following the second Business Day immediately prior to an Interest Payment Date to but excluding such Interest Payment Date, and for each day following the second Business Day immediately prior to the day of Maturity of the principal hereof to but excluding such day of Maturity, will be the Base Rate in effect on such applicable second Business Day; and provided, further, that, if any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, if the Base Rate is LIBOR or EURIBOR and such next succeeding Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as otherwise specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date the interest rate on this Security shall be the rate determined in accordance with such of the following Sections 3(b) through 3(j) as provide for determination of the Base Rate for this Security. The Calculation Agent shall determine the interest rate of this Security in accordance with the applicable Section below. Unless the Base Rate is LIBOR or EURIBOR, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate of this Security that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date on a day no later than the Calculation Date (as defined in Section 3(n) below) corresponding to such Interest Reset Date. However, the Calculation Agent need not wait until the Calculation Date to determine such interest rate if the rate information it needs to make such determination in the manner specified in the applicable provisions of Sections 3(b) through 3(j) hereof is available from the relevant sources specified in such applicable provisions. Upon request of the Holder to the Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect on this Security and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date. (b) DETERMINATION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE. If the Base Rate is the Commercial Paper Rate, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the Money Market Yield (as defined in Section 3(n) below) of the rate, for the second Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date (the "Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date"), for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) (as defined 10
in Section 3(n) below) under the heading "Commercial paper -- Nonfinancial". If the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the Commercial Paper Rate: (i) If the rate described above does not appear in H.15(519) at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date (as defined in Section 3(n) below) corresponding to such Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the rate, for such Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date, for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15 Daily Update (as defined in Section 3(n) below) or any other recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate, under the heading "Commercial Paper -- Nonfinancial". (ii) If the rate described in clause (i) above does not appear in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the following offered rates for U.S. dollar commercial paper that has the Index Maturity and is placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating agency: the rates offered as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date by three leading U.S. dollar commercial paper dealers in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent. (iii) If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (ii) above, the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(b) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (c) DETERMINATION OF PRIME RATE. If the Base Rate is the Prime Rate, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate, for the second Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date (the "Prime Interest Determination Date"), published in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank prime loan". If the Prime Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the Prime Rate: (i) If the rate described above does not appear in H.15(519) at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date corresponding to such Prime Interest Determination Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), then the Prime Rate will be the rate, for such Prime Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized 11
electronic source used for the purpose of displaying that rate, under the heading "Bank prime loan". (ii) If the rate described in clause (i) above does not appear in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the following rates as they appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1 page (as defined in Section 3(n) below): the rate of interest publicly announced by each bank appearing on that page as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate, as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Prime Interest Determination Date. (iii) If fewer than four of the rates referred to in clause above appear on the Reuters screen US PRIME 1 page, the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the Prime Rates or base lending rates, as of the close of business on such Prime Interest Determination Date, of three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent. For this purpose, the Calculation Agent will use rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year. (iv) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (iii) above, the Prime Rate shall be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(c) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (d) DETERMINATION OF LIBOR. If the Base Rate is LIBOR, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall be LIBOR on the corresponding LIBOR Interest Determination Date (as defined in Section 3(n) below) and shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: LIBOR will be either of the following rates, whichever appears on the face hereof: (x) the offered rate appearing on the Moneyline Telerate LIBOR Page (as defined in Section 3(n) below); or (y) the arithmetic mean of the offered rates appearing on the Reuters screen LIBOR page (as defined in Section 3(n) below) unless that page by its terms cites only one rate, in which case that rate; in either case, as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date for deposits of the Index Currency having the Index Maturity beginning on such Interest Reset Date. If no reference page is specified on the face hereof, Moneyline Telerate LIBOR Page will apply to this Security. 12
(i) If Moneyline Telerate LIBOR Page is specified on the face hereof and the rate referenced in clause (x) above does not appear on that page, or if Reuters screen LIBOR page is specified on the face hereof and fewer than two of the rates referenced in clause (y) above appear on that page or no rate appears on any page on which only one rate normally appears, then LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the Calculation Agent: deposits of the Index Currency having the Index Maturity beginning on such Interest Reset Date and in a Representative Amount (as defined in Section 3(n) below). The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each such bank to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. (ii) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described in clause (i) above, LIBOR for such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 A.M. in the principal financial center for the country issuing the Index Currency, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in that financial center selected by the Calculation Agent: loans of the Index Currency having the Index Maturity beginning on such Interest Reset Date and in a Representative Amount. (iii) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (ii) above, LIBOR will be the LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(d) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. If the Base Rate is LIBOR and no currency is specified on the face hereof as the Index Currency, the Index Currency shall be U.S. dollars. (e) DETERMINATION OF EURIBOR. If the Base Rate is EURIBOR, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the interest rate for deposits in euros designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACI -- the Financial Market Association (or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing that rate) on the second Euro Business Day (as defined in Section 3(n) below) before such Interest Reset Date (a "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"), and will be determined in accordance with the following provisions: (i) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euros having the Index Maturity beginning on such Interest Reset Date, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 248 (as defined in Section 3(n) below) as of 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date. (ii) If the rate described in clause (i) above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 248, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at 13
approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the Euro-Zone (as defined in Section 3(n) below) interbank market by the principal Euro-Zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the Calculation Agent: euro deposits having the Index Maturity beginning on such Interest Reset Date and in a Representative Amount. The Calculation Agent will request the principal Euro-Zone office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. (iii) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described in clause (ii) above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading Euro-Zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the Euro-Zone selected by the Calculation Agent: loans of euros having the Index Maturity beginning on such Interest Reset Date and in a Representative Amount. (iv) If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (iii) above, EURIBOR shall be the EURIBOR in effect on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(e) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (f) DETERMINATION OF TREASURY RATE. If the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate for the auction on the corresponding Treasury Interest Determination Date (as defined in Section 3(n) below) of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 56 or 57 under the heading "Investment Rate". If the Treasury Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the Treasury Rate: (i) If the rate described above does not appear on either Moneyline Telerate Page 56 or 57 at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date corresponding to such Treasury Interest Determination Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield (as defined in Section 3(n) below) of the rate, for such Treasury Interest Determination Date and for Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate, under the heading "U.S. government securities/Treasury bills/Auction high". (ii) If the rate described in clause (i) above does not appear in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available 14
from one of those sources at that time), the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the auction rate, for such Treasury Interest Determination Date and for Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity, as announced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. (iii) If the auction rate described in clause (ii) above is not so announced by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, or if no such auction is held for the relevant week, then the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate, for such Treasury Interest Determination Date and for Treasury Bills having a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading "U.S. government securities/Treasury bills/secondary market". (iv) If the rate described in clause (iii) above does not appear in H.15(519) at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), then the Treasury Rate will be the rate, for such Treasury Interest Determination Date and for Treasury Bills having a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate, under the heading "U.S. government securities/Treasury bills /secondary market". (v) If the rate described in clause (iv) above does not appear in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market bid rates for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity: the rates bid as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury Interest Determination Date, by three primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent. (vi) If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (v) above, the Treasury Rate shall be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(f) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof. (g) DETERMINATION OF CMT RATE. If the Base Rate is the CMT Rate, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the CMT Rate on the second Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date (the "CMT Interest Determination Date"). "CMT Rate" means the following rate displayed on the Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page (as defined in Section 3(n) below) under the heading " . . . Treasury Constant Maturities . . . Federal Reserve Board Release H.15 . . . Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.", under the column for the Designated CMT Index Maturity (as defined in Section 3(n) below): 15
(x) if the Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page is Moneyline Telerate Page 7051, the rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date; or (y) if the Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page is Moneyline Telerate Page 7052, the weekly or monthly average, as specified on the face hereof, for the week that ends immediately before the week in which such CMT Interest Determination Date falls, or for the month that ends immediately before the month in which such CMT Interest Determination Date falls, as applicable. If the CMT Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the CMT Rate: (i) If the applicable rate described above is not displayed on the relevant Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date corresponding to such CMT Interest Determination Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), then the CMT Rate will be the applicable Treasury constant maturity rate described above -- I.E., for the Designated CMT Index Maturity and for either such CMT Interest Determination Date or the weekly or monthly average, as applicable -- as published in H.15(519). (ii) If the applicable rate described in clause (i) above does not appear in H.15(519) at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), then the CMT Rate will be the Treasury constant maturity rate, or other U.S. Treasury rate, for the Designated CMT Index Maturity and with reference to such CMT Interest Determination Date, that: (a) is published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and (b) is determined by the Calculation Agent to be comparable to the applicable rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page and published in H.15(519). (iii) If the rate described in clause (ii) above does not appear in H.15(519) at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), then the CMT Rate will be the yield to maturity of the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market offered rates for the most recently issued Treasury Notes (as defined in Section 3(n) below) having an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Index Maturity, having a remaining term to maturity of not less than the Designated CMT Index Maturity minus one year and in a Representative Amount: the offered rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Interest Determination Date, of three primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent. In selecting such offered rates, the Calculation Agent will request quotations from five such primary dealers and will disregard the highest quotation -- or, if there is 16
equality, one of the highest -- and the lowest quotation -- or, if there is equality, one of the lowest. (iv) If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three quotations of the kind described in clause (iii) above, the CMT Rate will be the yield to maturity of the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market offered rates for Treasury Notes having an original maturity longer than the Designated CMT Index Maturity, having a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount: the offered rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Interest Determination Date, of three primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent. In selecting such offered rates, the Calculation Agent will request quotations from five such primary dealers and will disregard the highest quotation -- or, if there is equality, one of the highest -- and the lowest quotation -- or, if there is equality, one of the lowest. If two Treasury Notes with an original maturity longer than the CMT Designated Index Maturity have remaining terms to maturity that are equally close to the Designated CMT Index Maturity, the Calculation Agent will obtain quotations for the Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity. (v) If fewer than five but more than two such primary dealers are quoting as described in clause (iv) above, then the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates so obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations will be disregarded. (vi) If two or fewer primary dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (v) above, the CMT Rate shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(g) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (h) DETERMINATION OF CD RATE. If the Base Rate is the CD Rate, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate, on the second Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date (the "CD Interest Determination Date"), for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published in H.15(519) under the heading "CDs (secondary market)". If the CD Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the CD Rate: (i) If the rate described above does not appear in H.15(519) at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date corresponding to such CD Interest Determination Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), then the CD Rate shall be the rate described above as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate, under the heading "CDs (secondary market)". 17
(ii) If the rate described in clause (i) above does not appear in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), then CD Rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market offered rates for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major U.S. money center banks having a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount: the rates offered as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such CD Interest Determination Date, by three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent. (iii) If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (ii) above, the CD Rate will be the CD Rate in effect on such CD Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Base Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The Base Rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(h) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (i) DETERMINATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. If the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate, on the second Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date (the "Federal Funds Interest Determination Date"), for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal funds (effective)", as that rate is displayed on Moneyline Telerate Page 120. If the Federal Funds Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the Federal Funds Rate: (i) If the rate described above is not displayed on Moneyline Telerate Page 120 at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date corresponding to such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time), then the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate described above as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate, under the heading "Federal funds (effective)". (ii) If the rate described in clause (i) above is not displayed on Moneyline Telerate Page 120 and does not appear in H.15 (519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source at 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date (unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time), the Federal Funds Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight, U.S. dollar federal funds arranged, before 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date, by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar federal funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent. (iii) If fewer than three brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (ii) above, the Federal Funds Rate will be the Federal Funds Rate 18
in effect on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The interest rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(i) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (j) DETERMINATION OF 11TH DISTRICT RATE. If the Base Rate is the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate (the "11th District Rate"), the Base Rate that takes effect on any Interest Reset Date shall equal the 11th District Rate on the 11th District Interest Determination Date (as defined in Section 3(n) below) corresponding to such Interest Reset Date. The 11th District Rate on any 11th District Interest Determination Date shall be the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month immediately before the month in which such date falls, as displayed on Moneyline Telerate Page 7058 under the heading "11th District" as of 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on such date. If the 11th District Rate cannot be determined as described above, the following procedures will apply in determining the 11th District Rate: (i) If the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 7058 on such 11th District Interest Determination Date, then the 11th District Rate on such date will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by institutions that are members of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District for the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such date falls, as most recently announced by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco as such monthly weighted average cost of funds. (ii) If the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco fails to announce the cost of funds described in clause (i) above on or before such 11th District Interest Determination Date, the 11th District Rate that takes effect on such Interest Reset Date will be the 11th District Rate in effect on such 11th District Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Base Rate). The interest rate determined in accordance with this Section 3(j) will be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or by multiplying such Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier, if any. (k) MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM LIMITS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rate at which interest accrues on this Security (i) shall not at any time be higher than the Maximum Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof, in each case on an accrual basis, and (ii) shall not at any time be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. (l) CALCULATION OF INTEREST. Payments of interest hereon with respect to any Interest Payment Date or at the Maturity of the principal hereof will include interest accrued to but excluding such Interest Payment Date or the date of such Maturity, as the case may be. Accrued interest from the date of issue or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent by multiplying the Principal 19
Amount by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day from and including the Original Issue Date or from and including the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to but excluding the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each such day shall be expressed as a decimal and computed by dividing the interest rate (also expressed as a decimal) in effect on such day by 360, if the Base Rate is the Commercial Paper Rate, Prime Rate, LIBOR, EURIBOR, CD Rate, Federal Funds Rate or 11th District Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate or CMT Rate. All percentages resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the next higher or lower one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (e.g., 9.876541% (or .09876541) being rounded down to 9.87654% (or .0987654) and 9.876545% (or ..09876545) being rounded up to 9.87655% (or .0987655) ). All amounts used in or resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the nearest cent, in the case of U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding hundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency other than U.S. dollars, with one-half cent or one-half of a corresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded upward. (m) CALCULATION AGENT AND EXCHANGE RATE AGENT. The Company has initially appointed the institutions named on the face of this Security as Calculation Agent and Exchange Rate Agent, respectively, to act as such agents with respect to this Security, but the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint any other institution (including any Affiliate of the Company) to serve as any such agent from time to time. The Company will give the Trustee prompt written notice of any change in any such appointment. Insofar as this Security provides for any such agent to obtain rates, quotes or other data from a bank, dealer or other institution for use in making any determination hereunder, such agent may do so from any institution or institutions of the kind contemplated hereby notwithstanding that any one or more of such institutions are any such agent, Affiliates of any such agent or Affiliates of the Company. All determinations made by the Calculation Agent or the Exchange Rate Agent may be made by such agent in its sole discretion and, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Security and the Company. Neither the Calculation Agent nor the Exchange Rate Agent shall have any liability therefor. (n) DEFINITIONS OF CALCULATION TERMS.
