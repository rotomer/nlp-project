ITEM 12.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
        On January 20, 2004, 3M Company issued a press release reporting its sales and earnings results for fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003 and full year 2003 (furnished hereunder as Exhibit 99.1).
        The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
        In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discloses non-GAAP results that exclude special items. The company will continue to provide reconciliations of its disclosed non-GAAP financial reporting to the most comparable GAAP reporting. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. Earnings per share and other amounts before special items are not measures recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1

"Solid execution of both growth and productivity plans characterized the fourth quarter," said W. James McNerney, Jr., 3M chairman and CEO. "Sales reached an all-time high for the fourth consecutive quarter and earnings per share were the highest of any fourth quarter in 3M's history. It was a strong finish to the year."

Currency effects increased 2003 sales by 5.2 percent.
"Despite economic challenges in many parts of the world, the 3M team delivered a challenging operating plan in 2003," McNerney said, "and we are well-positioned for another successful year in 2004. Our corporate initiatives, now embedded in the 3M fabric, are helping to drive improvements in productivity, cash flow and, most importantly, top-line growth."
3M also raised its full-year 2004 earnings estimates. The company expects earnings to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.52 per share, an increase of 12 to 14 percent excluding special items in 2003.
