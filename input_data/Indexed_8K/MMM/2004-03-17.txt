FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 March 15, 2004  3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced it expects first-quarter and full-year earnings to be higher than previously indicated.
ST. PAUL, Minn.
For the first quarter ending March 31, the company anticipates earnings to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88 per share versus prior guidance of $0.80 to $0.82 per share. The company expects first-quarter sales volume growth to be toward the higher end of its previously stated range of 5 to 8 percent.
For the full year 2004, 3M increased its earnings guidance to $3.52 to $3.62 per share versus $3.46 to $3.52 previously. Full-year sales volume growth is expected to be in the range of 5 to 8 percent.
The company said that revenue growth, in U.S. dollars, is again expected to exceed 10 percent in the first quarter, led by continued strength in its Display and Graphics business, along with improving growth trends in many of its industrial-based businesses. Currency effects are expected to contribute about 5 percent to first-quarter sales growth.
