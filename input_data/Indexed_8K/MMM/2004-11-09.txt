3M's Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of an additional $200 million of the company's stock this year. This increases the total repurchase authorization to $1.7 billion for calendar year 2004. Of that $1.7 billion, more than $500 million remains for share buybacks in the fourth quarter. The Board also increased the annual share repurchase authorization to $2 billion between Jan. 1, 2005, and Jan. 31, 2006. As in prior years, reacquired shares will be used to support the company's stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes.
 
"Over the past several years, 3M's focus on driving growth and operational excellence through our corporate initiatives has produced outstanding earnings growth, cash flow and a superior return on capital." said James McNerney, Jr., chairman of the board and CEO. "Including our 2004 expectation, we have grown earnings at a compound annual rate approaching 20 percent over the last three years. This increase in the stock buyback authorization further demonstrates our strong balance sheet, the strength of the 3M business model and confidence in our ability to deliver significant growth in the future," he said.
 
As of Sept. 30, the company had 778,533,778 common shares outstanding and 127,296 shareholders of record.
