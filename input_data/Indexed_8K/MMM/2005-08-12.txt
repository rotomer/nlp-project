Item 1.01
Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement
On August 8, 2005, the 3M Company (the "Company") Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, approved changes in the non-employees directors' compensation effective July 1, 2005. The changes provide that the cash portion of the annual retainer increases from $55,000 to $75,000 and the additional annual retainer paid to committee chairs increases from $7,000 to 15,000.  The portion of the annual retainer payable only in the Company's common stock remains at $95,000. These changes are intended to keep the directors' compensation competitive.
Other elements of directors' compensation remain unchanged.
The following table shows compensation payable to non- employee directors before and after this increase:
