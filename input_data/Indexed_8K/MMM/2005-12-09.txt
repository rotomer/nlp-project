Item 5.02.             
Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
 
On December 7, 2005, 3M issued a press release entitled "3M Elects George W. Buckley Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer," a copy of which is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.2.  As described in the press release, Robert S. Morrison, who has served as 3M's interim Chief Executive Officer (3M's principal executive officer) since June 30, 2005, will continue as an employee of the Company through December 31, 2005 and continue to serve as a director of 3M.
(b)
 
(c)
          
(1) On December 6, 2005, Mr. Buckley accepted the offer of the Board of Directors of 3M to serve as 3M's Chief Executive Officer and President, effective as of December 6, 2005 (the "Effective Date").
 
(2) Mr. Buckley, age 58, served as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Brunswick Corporation since 2000; and in other executive positions at Brunswick Corporation from 1997 to 2000
.
 Mr. Buckley is a director of
Ingersoll-Rand Company.
Other than the Agreement, there is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Buckley and any other persons pursuant to which he was selected as an officer.
 
(3) Under the terms of the Agreement (defined in Item 1.01 above), Mr. Buckley is employed as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  The material terms and conditions of the Agreement are summarized below, which description is qualified by reference to the provisions of the Agreement attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.1 Capitalized terms are defined in the Agreement.
 
Term of Agreement
 
The Agreement is effective December 6, 2005, and has an initial term of 3 years.  Beginning on December 6, 2006, the agreement automatically extends itself so that the remaining term of the Agreement is always 2 years.  However, the term will end on Mr. Buckley's 65 birthday (February 23, 2012) unless the parties otherwise agree.
th
 
Duties
 
Mr. Buckley will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Board of Directors
 
Mr. Buckley has been elected as a Director of the Company and as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
 
Base Salary
 
Mr. Buckley will receive an annual base salary of $1,600,000.  This base salary will be reviewed at least annually and may be increased by the Compensation Committee of the Board, but may not be decreased without Mr. Buckley's consent.
 
Bonus
 
Mr. Buckley will be eligible to participate in the Company's Executive Profit Sharing Plan.  His target annual bonus under such Plan will be the greater of $2,600,000 and 150% of his annual base salary.  The amount of the annual bonus actually paid to Mr. Buckley will depend on his performance and the performance of the Company, and may range from zero to a maximum of 150% of his target annual bonus (although the Board reserves the discretion to pay Mr. Buckley an annual bonus exceeding this maximum).  This annual bonus will be paid to Mr. Buckley at times and in a manner (cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock) consistent with the payment of annual bonuses to other senior executives of the Company.  For 2006 only, Mr. Buckley's annual bonus may not be less than $2,600,000.
 
Initial Grants
 
On the effective date of the Agreement, Mr. Buckley was granted nonqualified options to purchase 250,000 shares of 3M common stock at the fair market value of a share of 3M common stock on that date ($78.15).  These options have a 10-year term, and become exercisable in increments of 20% on each of the first 5 anniversaries of the grant date assuming continued employment with the Company.  These options become vested and exercisable in full upon Mr. Buckley's death or termination due to disability, or upon a change of control of the Company.
 
On the effective date of the Agreement, Mr. Buckley was also granted 50,000 restricted stock units with respect to shares of 3M common stock.  These restricted stock units will vest in increments of 20% on each of the first 5 anniversaries of the grant date assuming continued employment with the Company.  Dividend equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units will be provided during the vesting period.  These restricted stock units become vested in full upon Mr. Buckley's death or termination due to disability, or upon a change of control of the Company.
Subsequent Grants
 
At the same time in 2006 that the Company grants stock options to its other senior executives, Mr. Buckley will be granted nonqualified stock options having a Black-Scholes value of $6,000,000.  The Compensation Committee will consider granting Mr. Buckley additional stock options in 2007 and years subsequent thereto, based on his performance and consistent with its treatment of other senior executives of the Company.
Performance Unit Plan Awards
 
On the effective date of the Agreement, Mr. Buckley was awarded 16,667 performance units under 3M's Performance Unit Plan with respect to each of the performance periods beginning in 2004 and 2005.  Each award has a target value of $2,000,000, although the ultimate value of each award will depend on the performance of the Company during the respective 3-year performance period.  Assuming that he remains employed by the Company through the end of the respective performance periods for such awards, Mr. Buckley will receive payment for one-third of the value of the 2004 performance units and two-thirds of the value of the 2005 performance units.
 
At the same time in 2006 that the Company makes Performance Unit Plan awards to its other senior executives, Mr. Buckley will be awarded 16,667 performance units with respect to the 3-year performance period beginning in 2006.  This award will have a target value of $2,000,000, although the ultimate value of the award will depend on the performance of the Company during the performance period.  Mr. Buckley must remain employed by the Company through the end of this 3-year performance period in order to receive payment for this award.
 
Make Whole Grants
 
In order to replace the unvested restricted stock units that he will forfeit as a result of leaving his previous employer, Mr. Buckley was granted (on the effective date of the Agreement) 157,808 restricted stock units with respect to shares of 3M common stock.  25,000 of these restricted stock units will vest on December 31, 2006 and the remaining 132,808 restricted stock units will vest on December 6, 2010 assuming continued employment with the Company.  Dividend equivalents in the form of cash will be paid to Mr. Buckley during the vesting period.  These restricted stock units become vested in full upon Mr. Buckley's death or termination due to disability, or upon a change of control of the Company.
 
In order to replace the annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation that he will forfeit as a result of leaving his previous employer, the Company will pay Mr. Buckley a cash bonus of $4,117,500 on or before March 15, 2006.
Benefits
 
Mr. Buckley will be entitled to participate in all of the retirement and welfare benefit programs of the Company offered to its other senior executives.  The Company will pay $95,000 in annual premiums on life insurance policies owned by Mr. Buckley.  Mr. Buckley will be entitled to 4 weeks of paid vacation per year.  In the event Mr. Buckley remains employed by the Company until his 62 birthday and his employment is terminated thereafter for a reason other than Cause, he will deemed to have retired for purposes of the Company's equity and benefit plans except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of his employment agreement.
nd
 
Relocation
 
The Company will pay Mr. Buckley's reasonable expenses of relocating his primary residence to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, consistent with the Company's relocation policies applicable to other senior executives.  If payment of these relocation expenses results in taxable income to Mr. Buckley, the Company will make an additional payment to Mr. Buckley (a gross-up) with which he may pay the taxes on such income.  The Company has agreed to purchase Mr. Buckley's current principal residence at its then prevailing value (to be determined by an appraiser mutually agreeable to both parties) if he is unable to complete the sale of such residence on or prior to December 31, 2006.
 
Perquisites
 
Mr. Buckley will be eligible for the same perquisites that the Company makes available to its other senior executives.  Both Mr. Buckley and his family will be entitled to use the aircraft owned by the Company for business and personal purposes.  The Company will provide Mr. Buckley with an automobile and driver for travel in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and with an additional luxury automobile for which the Company will pay all insurance, maintenance, gasoline and other operating expenses.  The Company will provide appropriate security at Mr. Buckley's personal residences.
 
Supplemental Retirement Benefit
 
Mr. Buckley will earn a supplemental retirement benefit payable in the form of a lump sum at the time of his termination of employment.  The amount of this benefit will be the actuarially equivalent present value of the amount by which (a) a single life annuity payable for Mr. Buckley's lifetime commencing at age 60 (or, if later, on the date of his termination of employment) equal to 40% of his highest average annual cash compensation (base salary plus bonus) during any 3 consecutive years during his final 10 years of employment, exceeds (b) the sum of his actual pension benefits payable at age 60 (or, if later, on the date of his termination of employment) under the plans of the Company and his previous
employers.  The benefit formula for this supplemental retirement benefit increases by 2% (from 40%) for each full year following Mr. Buckley's 60 birthday that he remains employed by the Company, up to a maximum of 50%.  This supplemental retirement benefit vests in full on December 6, 2010, or upon Mr. Buckley's death or termination due to disability.  In the event of Mr. Buckley's death or termination due to disability prior to his 60 birthday, the benefit formula increases to 50%, the annuity amounts described in (a) and (b) above are those commencing at age 65, and the entire benefit amount is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is Mr. Buckley's years of service with the Company through his date of death or termination and the denominator of which is 6.
th
th
 
Severance
 
In the event the Company terminates Mr. Buckley's employment without Cause or if he terminates his employment with Good Reason, Mr. Buckley would receive: (a) cash severance equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and target annual bonus payable in the form of 24 equal monthly installments (or in the form of an immediate lump sum if the termination follows a change in control of the Company), (b) a pro rata portion of the annual bonus that Mr. Buckley would have been eligible to receive for the year of termination, (c) if a change in control of the Company causes any payment upon his termination of employment to be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, a tax gross-up payment with which to pay such tax and the additional taxes payable as a result of such payment, (d) immediate vesting of the stock options, restricted stock units, performance units and supplemental retirement benefit provided under the Agreement, and continued welfare benefits for the period that cash severance benefits are payable.  No severance benefits (other than accrued salary and benefits) are payable in the event of the termination of Mr. Buckley's employment by the Company for Cause or by Mr. Buckley without good reason.
 
Non-Competition
 
During his employment by the Company and for a period of 2 years thereafter (but for an unlimited period with respect to the disclosure of the Company's confidential information), Mr. Buckley has agreed to comply with restrictive covenants prohibiting the disclosure of the Company's confidential information, the solicitation of the Company's customer, vendors and employees, the performance of services for a competitor of the Company, and the acquisition of an ownership interest in a competitor of the Company.
 
Reimbursement of Fees
 
The Company will pay Mr. Buckley's reasonable legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the completion of his employment agreement, up to a
maximum of $125,000, and pay him a tax gross-up payment with respect to its payments of such fees.
 
In the event of any dispute between the Company and Mr. Buckley regarding his right to compensation and benefits under his employment agreement, and if Mr. Buckley prevails in such dispute, the Company will reimburse Mr. Buckley for the amount of his reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred during such dispute.
 
Indemnification
 
Mr. Buckley will be indemnified by the Company against liability as an officer and director of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

(i)            is an amount payable in the form of a single life annuity commencing at age 60 (or if later, the Executive's Date of Termination) and payable in monthly installments to Executive for his life equal to one-twelfth (1/12th) multiplied by a benefit percentage of 40% of the Executive's highest average annual compensation, where "highest average annual compensation" is the annual average of the sum of Executive's Base Salary and Annual Bonus paid, or earned for a prior Fiscal Year and not yet paid, for the three consecutive calendar years out of the last 10 calendar years preceding Termination of Employment during which such average is the highest; provided, however, that such average shall not be less than the sum of Executive's Base Salary in effect on the Commencement Date plus his minimum Annual Bonus for the 2006 Fiscal Year.  If the Executive has a Termination of Employment after age 60, the Executive's benefit percentage of 40% under the preceding sentence shall be increased from 40% by two percentage points (2%) for each full period from the first anniversary of his date of birth following attainment of age 60 to each next succeeding such anniversary that he remains continuously employed by the Company after reaching age 60 and up to and including reaching age 65 (accruing a maximum benefit percentage of 50%); and
(ii)           is the sum of the Actual Prior Employer Pension Benefits, Actual Company Pension Benefits, and benefits paid or payable to Executive under any other employer's Pension Plan with respect to service prior to the Commencement Date.
If the remainder is zero or less, no amount shall be payable by Company hereunder.
(b)           Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.1(a) to the contrary, if Executive has a Termination of Employment for death or Disability prior to age 60, Executive's Supplemental Retirement Benefit shall be determined under Section 7.1(a) except (i) the amount described in Section 7(a)(i) shall be an amount payable in the form of a single life annuity commencing at age 65 (but for such Termination of Employment) (ii) the percentage described in Section 7.1(a)(i) shall equal 50%, (iii) the amounts described in Section 7.1(a)(ii) shall be those amounts commencing at age 65 (but for such Termination of Employment) and (iv) the Supplemental Retirement Benefit described in Section 7.1(a) (as modified by this Section 7.1(b)) shall be multiplied by a fraction (not to exceed 1.0), the numerator of which is the number of Executive's whole and partial Years of Service as of the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is 6.
7.2           .  Any benefits payable under this Article VII that are fully vested under Section 7.3 shall be paid as of the Date of Termination in a lump sum equal to the Actuarial Equivalent present value of an annuity described in Subsection 7.1(a) (including any modifications under Section 7.1(b).)  In the event of a Termination of Employment by reason of Executive's death, the amount of any such lump sum payment shall be paid to the Executive's Beneficiary.  The benefit may also be paid in the form of a commercially available annuity or life insurance contract that is mutually agreeable to the parties.

7.3           .  Executive shall become fully vested in the benefits under this Article VII on the fifth Anniversary Date provided the Executive remains continuously employed by the Company from the Commencement Date to such fifth Anniversary Date, except that in the event of Executive's Termination of Employment by reason of death or Disability, a Termination Without Cause, or a Termination for Good Reason, Executive shall immediately be fully vested as to such benefits.  If Executive shall have a Termination of Employment for any other reason prior to completion of five Years of Service, Executive shall forfeit and shall not receive any portion of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit.
Vesting
7.4           .  Executive shall participate in, and be entitled to benefits under, any other retirement plans of the Company which are not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, to the extent provided in such plan or arrangement.
Other Retirement Benefits
ARTICLE VIII. TERMINATION BENEFITS
8.1           .
Termination for Cause or Other Than for Good Reason, etc
(a)           If the Company terminates Executive's employment for Cause or Executive terminates his employment other than for Good Reason, death or Disability, the Company shall pay to Executive immediately after the Date of Termination an amount equal to the sum of Executive's Accrued Base Salary, Accrued Annual Bonus and Other Accrued Benefits and Executive shall not be entitled to receive any Severance Payment.
(b)           The Company may not terminate Executive's employment for Cause unless:
(i)            no fewer than 30 days prior to the Date of Termination, the Company provides Executive with written notice (the "Notice of Consideration") of its intent to consider termination of Executive's employment for Cause, including a detailed description of the specific reasons which form the basis for such consideration;
(ii)           after providing Notice of Consideration, the Board may, by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members (excluding for this purpose Executive if he is a member of the Board, any other management member of the Board and any other member of the Board reasonably believed by the Board to be involved in the events leading to the Notice of Consideration), suspend Executive with pay until a final determination pursuant to this Section 8.1 has been made; provided, that if following any such suspension, the requisite two-thirds vote under Subparagraph (iv) is not obtained, Executive's employment shall, on the date of such presentation to the Board under Subparagraph (iii), be deemed to have terminated as a Termination for Good Reason unless Executive shall consent in writing to the contrary.
 
19
 
(iii)          on a date designated in the Notice of Consideration, which date shall be at least 30 days following the date the Notice of Consideration is provided, Executive shall have the opportunity to appear before the Board, with or without legal representation, at Executive's election, to present arguments and evidence on his own behalf; and
(iv)          following the presentation to the Board as provided in Subparagraph (iii) above or Executive's failure to appear before the Board at the date and time specified in the Notice of Consideration, Executive may be terminated for Cause only if the Board, by the two-thirds vote of its members (excluding Executive if he is a member of the Board, any other management member of the Board and any other member of the Board reasonably believed by the Board to be involved in the events leading the Board to consider terminating Executive for Cause), determines that the actions or inactions of Executive specified in the Notice of Termination occurred, that such actions or inactions constitute Cause, and that Executive's employment should accordingly be terminated for Cause.
8.2           .  If, before the end of the Employment Period, Executive's employment terminates due to his death or Disability, the Company shall pay to Executive or his Beneficiaries, as the case may be, (a) immediately after the Date of Termination an amount which is equal to the sum of Executive's Accrued Base Salary, Accrued Annual Bonus and Other Accrued Benefits and (b) at such time as annual bonuses are paid to other senior executives for the year in which the Executive's employment terminates, a lump sum cash amount which is equal to the Executive's Pro Rata Annual Bonus.
Termination for Death or Disability
8.3           .  In the event of a Termination Without Cause or a Termination for Good Reason (whether during or after the Employment Period), Executive shall receive the following:
Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason
(a)           immediately after the Date of Termination, a lump sum cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the sum of Executive's Accrued Base Salary, Accrued Annual Bonus, and Other Accrued Benefits;
(b)           at such time as annual bonuses are paid to other senior executives for the year in which Executive's employment terminates, a lump sum cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Executive's Pro Rata Annual Bonus;
(c)           an amount equal to two (2) times Executive's Annualized Total Compensation payable in 24 equal monthly installments commencing on the fifteenth day of the calendar month after the Date of Termination; provided that if the Executive has a Termination without Cause or a Termination for Good Reason on or after a Change of Control, the foregoing amount shall be paid immediately after the Date of Termination in a lump sum cash amount in immediately available funds;
(d)           the benefits (or, if such benefits are not available, the value thereof) specified in Section 6.2 to which Executive is entitled as of the Date of Termination for
 
20
 
the Severance Period, provided that such benefits shall be reduced by any similar benefits provided by a subsequent employer; provided further that (i) with respect to any benefit to be provided on an insured basis, such value shall be the present value of the premiums expected to be paid for such coverage, and with respect to other benefits, such value shall be the present value of the expected net cost to Company of providing such benefits and (ii) from and after the Date of Termination, Executive shall not become entitled to any additional awards under Section 6.1 or any plans, practices, policies or programs of the Company; and
(e)           immediately after the Date of Termination, a lump sum amount in immediately available funds of any amount then payable to Executive pursuant to Sections 5.9, 6.7 and 6.8.
8.4           .  The amounts payable hereunder are in lieu of any other termination or severance payments or benefits entitlement of Executive, including under any other programs of the Company, any Subsidiary or their Affiliates.  The amounts payable hereunder shall reduce and be in full satisfaction of any statutory entitlement (including notice of termination, termination pay and severance pay) of Executive upon a Termination of Employment, and shall constitute Executive's exclusive remedy for any damages relating to a Termination of Employment for any reason.
Other Termination Benefits or Remedies
8.5           .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary:
Payment of Compensation
(a)           If payment or provision of any amount or other benefit that is "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code at the time otherwise specified in this Agreement or elsewhere would subject such amount or benefit to additional tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code, and if payment or provision thereof at a later date would avoid any such additional tax, then the payment or provision thereof shall be postponed to the earliest date on which such amount or benefit can be paid or provided without incurring any such additional tax.  In the event this Section 8.5 requires a deferral of any payment, such payment shall be accumulated and paid in a single lump sum on such earliest date together with interest for the period of delay, compounded annually, equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal), and in effect as of the date the payment should otherwise have been provided.
(b)           If any payment or benefit permitted or required under this Agreement, or otherwise, is reasonably determined by either party to be subject for any reason to a material risk of additional tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code, then the parties shall promptly agree in good faith on appropriate provisions to avoid such risk without materially changing the economic value of this Agreement to either party.
8.6           .  As a condition precedent to receiving any payment or benefit pursuant to Sections 7.2, 8.2(b) or 8.3(b) through (e) above, the Executive (or in the event of Executive's death, the executor of his estate) shall first execute, and deliver to Company not later than sixty (60) days after the Date of Termination (or in the event of Executive's death, not later
General Release
than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Date of Termination), and not timely revoke, a Release in substantially the form attached as Attachment A to this Agreement.

(a)           Executive covenants and agrees that, during the Employment Period and during the two-year period immediately following any Termination of Employment, Executive will not:
(i)            directly or indirectly employ or seek to employ any person employed at that time by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise encourage or entice any such person to leave such employment;
(ii)           become employed by, enter into a consulting arrangement with or otherwise agree to perform personal services for a Competitor (as defined in Section 9.1(b));
(iii)          acquire an ownership interest in a Competitor, other than not more than a 2% equity interest in a publicly-traded Competitor; or
(iv)          solicit any customers or vendors of Company or its Subsidiaries on behalf of or for the benefit of a Competitor.
(b)           For purposes of this Section, "Competitor" means any Person which sells goods or services in the geographic area described below, which goods or services are the same or similar to (or may be used as a substitute therefore) those sold by a business that (i) is being conducted by Company or any Subsidiary in the geographic area at the time in question and (ii) was being conducted by Company or any Subsidiary in the geographic area on the date of Executive's Termination of Employment.
(c)           Executive covenants and agrees that at no time during the Employment Period nor at any time following any Termination of Employment will Executive communicate, furnish, divulge or disclose in any manner to any Person any Confidential Information (as defined in Section 9.1(d)) without the prior express written consent of the Company.  After a Termination of Employment, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge such Confidential Information to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.
(d)           For purposes of this Section, "Confidential Information" shall mean financial information about the Company, contract terms with vendors and suppliers, customer and supplier lists and data, trade secrets and such other competitively-sensitive information to which Executive has access as a result of his positions with the Company, except that Confidential Information shall not include any information which was or

9.2           .  Executive acknowledges that monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy for Company in the event of a breach of this Article IX, and that it would be impossible for Company to measure damages in the event of such a breach.  Therefore, Executive agrees that, in addition to other rights that Company may have, Company is entitled to an injunction preventing Executive from any breach of this Article IX.
Injunction
9.3           .
Return of Consideration
(a)           If at any time the Executive willfully and materially breaches any of the covenants in Section 9.1 and fails to cure as provided below then:  (1) the Executive shall repay to the Company all amounts received under Section 8.3(c) (if any); (2) the Executive shall forfeit any unexercised stock options under any Designated Plan (defined below); (3) the Executive shall forfeit and repay to the Company the Supplemental Retirement Benefit; (4) the Executive shall forfeit any restricted stock, restricted stock units or other equity award made under any Designated Plan and outstanding on the date of breach; and (5) the Executive shall forfeit and repay to the Company any gain realized by the Executive within the 12 months prior to such breach from any equity compensation award under any Designated Plan (including but not limited to the exercise of any stock option, the delivery of shares for restricted stock units  or the sale of any formerly restricted stock within such period regardless of whether the equity award was made within such period).  A breach of the covenants of Section 9.1 shall not be deemed willful if the Executive cures such breach to the extent curable within 10 days after Executive receives written notice of such breach from the Company and shall be deemed willful if the Executive fails to cure such breach to the extent curable within 10 days after Executive receives written notice of such breach from the Company.  A breach shall not be deemed to be material unless it is reasonably expected to materially damage the Company.  Any amount forfeited or to be repaid pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall be paid by the Executive to the Company, upon written notice from the Company, within 10 days of such notice, with interest at the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal) prevailing from time to time plus two (2) percentage points; or, if less, then the maximum interest rate permitted by law.
(b)           Such gain shall be determined on a gross basis, without reduction for any taxes incurred, as of the date of the realization event, and without regard to any subsequent change in the fair market value of a share of Common Shares.  The Company shall have the right to offset such gain against any amount otherwise owed to the Executive by the Company (whether as wages, vacation pay, or pursuant to any benefit plan or other compensatory arrangement).
 
23
 
(c)           For purposes of this Section 9.3 a "Designated Plan" is each annual bonus and incentive plan, stock option, restricted stock, or other equity compensation or long term incentive compensation plan, deferred compensation plan, or supplemental retirement plan of the Company under which Executive has received any benefit.

ATTACHMENT A WAIVER AND RELEASE
This Waiver and Release ("Release") is granted by George W. Buckley (the "Executive") in favor of 3M Company (the "Company").  The Executive acknowledges that he has entered into this Release voluntarily, and that it is intended to be a legally binding commitment by him.
In consideration for and contingent upon the Executive's right to receive certain compensation and benefits described in the Employment Agreement and specified in Exhibit 1 attached hereto and made a part hereof, between the parties hereto dated December 6, 2005 (the "Employment Agreement") the Executive hereby agrees as follows:
(a)           General Waiver and Release.  Except as provided in Paragraph (e) below, Executive, on his own behalf and on behalf of any person acting through or under the Executive hereby release, waive and forever discharge the Company, its past subsidiaries and its past and present affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns, and their respective present or past officers, trustees, directors, shareholders, executives and agents of each of them, from any and all claims, demands, actions, liabilities and other claims for relief and remuneration whatsoever (including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses), whether known or unknown, absolute, contingent or otherwise, that arose in the Executive's favor at any time up to and including the date of his execution of this Release, and that arise out of or relate to the Executive's employment with the Company, or the cessation and termination of such employment (each, a "Claim"), including (without limitation) any such Claim that arises under the Employment Agreement or under any other written or oral agreement between the Company and the Executive, or that relates to any change in the Executive's employment status or in his benefits or compensation, or that arises from any tortious injury, breach of contract, wrongful discharge (including any Claim for constructive discharge), infliction of emotional distress, slander, libel or defamation of character, or that arises under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991), the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Equal Pay Act, the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any other federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule or executive order, or that constitutes a tort or contract claim.

(b)           Miscellaneous.  The Executive acknowledges that the Employment Agreement specifies payment from the Company to himself, the total of which meets or exceeds any and all funds due him from the Company in the absence of his executing this Release, and that he will not seek to obtain any additional funds from the Company with the exception of nonreimbursed business expenses.  (For avoidance of doubt, this Release does not preclude the Executive from seeking workers compensation, unemployment compensation, or benefit payments from Company's insurance carriers that could be due him.)
 
28
 
(c)           Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidential Information.  Executive warrants that he has, and will continue to comply fully with Section 9.1 of the Employment Agreement.

THE EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT IF HE DECIDES NOT TO SIGN THIS RELEASE, OR IF HE REVOKES THIS RELEASE, THAT HE WILL IMMEDIATELY REFUND TO THE COMPANY ANY AND ALL SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER BENEFITS HE MAY HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED.

EXECUTIVE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE IS HEREBY ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY, HE HAS BEEN GIVEN AT LEAST 21 DAYS TO CONSIDER THIS RELEASE BEFORE THE DEADLINE FOR SIGNING IT, AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE MAY REVOKE THE RELEASE WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS AFTER SIGNING IT.

ST. PAUL, Minn.

Dec. 7, 2005
-
3M (NYSE: MMM) announced today that George W. Buckley has been elected chairman, president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. He succeeds interim chairman and CEO Robert S. Morrison, who has led the company since July 1, 2005.
 
Buckley, 58, comes to 3M from Brunswick Corporation where he served as chairman and chief executive officer since June 2000.
