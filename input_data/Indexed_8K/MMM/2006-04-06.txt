Exhibit 99
 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
April 6, 2006 3M (NYSE:MMM) today announced it expects first-quarter, local-currency sales growth and earnings per share to be higher than previously indicated.
ST. PAUL, Minn.

For the first quarter ended March 31, the company anticipates organic local-currency sales growth of approximately 8 percent versus its previous guidance range of 4 to 7 percent. The company expects total local-currency growth, including the CUNO acquisition, of more than 10 percent. This strong sales growth reflects continued momentum in 3M's industrial, safety, consumer and electronics-related businesses and the results of accelerated growth investments which began in the second half of 2005. In U.S. dollar terms, first-quarter revenue growth is expected to be approximately 8 percent.
 
First-quarter earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.16 per share, versus prior guidance of $1.10 to $1.14 per share. Both ranges include an anticipated stock options cost of $0.02 per share.
 
3M will discuss complete first-quarter results and its outlook for the remainder of 2006 in a teleconference April 21, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. This conference will be available via webcast at http://investor.3M.com.
