EXHIBIT 99
 
As more fully described in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K and below, during the first quarter of 2006, 3M effected certain business segment realignments and adopted an accounting standard that requires 3M to expense stock-based compensation. 3M is including in this Current Report on Form 8-K the following annual and quarterly information for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (except where indicated otherwise):
 
 - 
                 
Supplemental unaudited reclassified business segment net sales
 - 
                 
Supplemental unaudited operating income information to reflect the business segment realignments and to reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R
 - 
                 
Supplemental unaudited stock-based compensation expense amounts by business segment relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R
 - 
                 
Supplemental unaudited reclassified related sales growth information (provided on annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004)
 
This supplemental unaudited information is being provided to show reclassified historical results for the realigned segments, in addition to showing revised operating income information that reflects the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R. Operating income was revised since 3M elected to use the modified retrospective method upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, with prior periods adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1995.
The Company did not operate under the realigned segments structure for any of these prior periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure, including the impact of the adoption of the stock-based compensation accounting standard, with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
 
As described in our 2005 Annual Report, effective in the first quarter of 2006, 3M made two changes to its business segments:
 
 - 
                 
3M combined its Industrial and Transportation business segments (which on a combined basis had previously reported 2005 sales of $5,578 million)
 - 
                 
3M's Personal Care Division (2005 sales of $613 million) was transferred from the Health Care segment to the combined Industrial and Transportation segment.
 
In addition, during the first quarter of 2006, certain adhesive tapes (2005 sales of $47 million) previously in the Industrial and Transportation segment were transferred to the construction and home improvement business within the Consumer and Office segment. On a reclassified basis, 2005 sales for Industrial and Transportation totaled $6,144 million. This new Industrial and Transportation segment is intended to leverage common markets, sales channels and customers, technologies, manufacturing facilities and selling processes. Further, 3M formed the Film and Materials Resource Division as a corporate resource for the development of films and materials. This resulted in the transfer of 3M's commercial videotape business (2005 sales of $47 million), which 3M began to phase out in the fourth quarter of 2004, to the Corporate and Unallocated segment from the Display and Graphics segment. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of all of these changes for all periods presented.
 
3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in products, technologies and services. These segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually all of the Company's product lines. 3M is not dependent on any single product or market. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income and other financial information shown.
 
In addition, effective January 1, 2006, 3M adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment", which requires 3M to expense stock-based compensation. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified retrospective method. Effective January 1, 2006, all prior periods were revised to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1995.

OPERATING INCOME
Corporate and Unallocated operating income principally includes corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation expenses, corporate restructuring program charges and other miscellaneous items. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
In 2005, Corporate and Unallocated was impacted by In 2003, Corporate and Unallocated included a pre-tax charge of $93 million (recorded in the first quarter of 2003) related to an adverse ruling associated with a lawsuit filed against 3M in 1997 by LePage's Inc.  As discussed previously, Corporate and Unallocated net sales and operating income information also includes
a pre-tax charge of approximately $30 million (recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005) in connection with settlement agreements of one pending LePage's follow-on class actions and of two individual follow-on actions, all involving direct purchasers of transparent tape.
3M's commercial videotape business.
 
The following table provides by business segment the amount of stock-based compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.  This supplemental unaudited information is being provided to show the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R on the Company's business segment operating income results. Since the Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified retrospective method, all prior periods were adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1995.  As shown in the table, 3M's election to use the modified restrospective method upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R reduced 3M's operating income by $155 million in 2005, $252 million in 2004, and $209 million in 2003, when compared to previously reported results. The Company did not operate under the realigned segments structure for any of these prior periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure, including the impact of the adoption of the stock-based compensation accounting standard, with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
