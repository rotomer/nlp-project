FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.

April 26, 2007

3M (NYSE: MMM) today reported record first-quarter 2007 earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.85 per share, up 52.2 percent and 58.1 percent, respectively, from the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2007 net income includes a net gain of $422 million, or $0.57 per share, from the sale of the company's branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe, net of various other special items (a-c).
 
"Our strategy for achieving higher growth while maintaining superior financial returns is working well, as evidenced by this quarter's broad-based growth and profitability," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and CEO. "Quarterly sales grew by 6.1 percent, reaching an all-time high, and we delivered record net income
-
all while investing in additional capacity to build and sustain growth in the future. Importantly, we were able to overcome the impact of the pharmaceutical business divestiture, as sales improved by almost 10 percent ex-pharma and earnings grew at double-digit rates. Our exceptionally strong start in 2007 gives me great confidence in our people around the world to keep accelerating growth and leveraging it to the bottom line."
 
Executive Summary
 - 
                 
Revenues of $5.9 billion, up 6.1 percent from 2006. Excluding the impact of divested branded pharmaceuticals business, sales increased nearly 10 percent.

Key Financial Highlights
First-quarter worldwide sales in U.S. dollars totaled $5.9 billion, up 6.1 percent compared to the first quarter of 2006.  Local-currency sales including acquisitions increased 7.4 percent, and foreign exchange impacts added 2.5 percent in the quarter. Divestitures, namely the recent sale of the company's branded pharmaceuticals business, reduced reported sales growth by 3.8 percent.  Local-currency sales including acquisitions increased 20.4 percent in Health Care, 15 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 8.2 percent in Consumer and Office, 4 percent in Industrial and Transportation, and 1.2 percent in Electro and Communications. Local-currency sales decreased by 0.8 percent in Display and Graphics, largely due to difficult year-on-year comparisons resulting from last year's first-quarter inventory buildup within the LCD industry.
 
First-quarter net income was $1.4 billion, or $1.85 per share, versus $899 million, or $1.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2006. Net income and earnings per share increased 52.2 percent and 58.1 percent, respectively. The divested pharmaceuticals business contributed 5 cents per share in
 
the comparable quarter last year. First quarter 2007 net income included a net profit of $422 million, or $0.57 per share, due to a gain on the sale of the branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe that closed in January, net of various other special items (a-c).
 
"The great strength of our brands, manufacturing capabilities and broad geographic distribution network, combined with the tremendous efforts across the company to invigorate 3M's core businesses are producing tangible results," said Buckley. "Our ability to deliver products that embody innovative 3M technology to make our customers more successful will accelerate growth well into the future."

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share measures that exclude special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the company's operations. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months ended Mar. 31, 2007.
 
(a)
         
In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. 3M received proceeds of $817 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $786 million in the first quarter of 2007. In December 2006, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in the United States, Canada, and Latin America region and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. In connection with all of these transactions, 3M's Drug Delivery Systems Division (DDSD) entered into agreements whereby it became a source of supply to the acquiring companies. The Company expects annual revenues of approximately $100 million from these supply arrangements. Such outsourcing arrangements involve a lower profitability than the other product and service offerings of most of our existing Health Care businesses. Because of the extent of 3M cash flows from these agreements in relation to those of the disposed-of businesses, the operations of the branded pharmaceuticals business are not classified as discontinued operations.
 
(b)
        
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed the identification of restructuring actions to be taken and obtained approvals from the appropriate level of management, resulting in a restructuring charge. In the first quarter of 2007 the Company recorded an additional net pre-tax restructuring charge of $12 million. The Company incurred additional restructuring expenses, primarily fixed and intangible asset impairments related to the Electro and Communications segment. In the Health Care segment, employee-related restructuring liabilities were adjusted to reflect current estimates of Health Care employee-related restructuring expenses.
 
(c)
         
Various environmental regulatory developments occurred during the first quarter of 2007, including increased regulatory activity in Minnesota and the receipt of a permit to begin work addressing perfluoronated compounds in the soil and groundwater at the Company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. The Company also recently completed a comprehensive review with environmental consultants regarding its other environmental liabilities which include the estimated costs of addressing trace amounts of perfluoronated compounds in drinking water sources in the City of Oakdale and Lake Elmo, Minnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama and Cottage Grove, Minnesota and at several former disposal sites in Minnesota. As a result of these regulatory developments and of that review, the Company increased its accrued liabilities by $121 million in the first quarter of 2007 to address these planned remediation activities.  The company expects that most of the spending will occur over the next three to seven years. This quarter's expense was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
No adverse human health effects are caused by perflouronated compounds at current levels of exposure.  This conclusion is supported by a large body of research including laboratory studies and epidemiology studies of exposed employees. This research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and
shared with the EPA and global scientific-community.
 
(d)
        
As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." This standard required employers to
recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 158, the Company recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (which is part of stockholders' equity) of approximately $1.9 billion and reversed prepaid pension and postretirement benefit long-term assets of approximately $2.5 billion. Other liabilities, including the impact of deferred taxes, decreased by approximately $0.6 billion. This change impacted the Consolidated Balance Sheet only, with no impact to net income or cash flows.
 
(e)   The goodwill, intangible assets and other assets increase when compared to Mar. 31, 2006 primarily relates to acquisitions.
 
 
(f)
           
Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of performance and uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash payments associated with certain current and prior period special items as follows:
 
1.
              
First-quarter 2007 was negatively impacted by approximately $394 million in tax payments related to the sale of our global branded pharmaceuticals business.
 
2.
              
Fourth-quarter 2006 was negatively impacted by approximately $95 in cash paid out for the Brontes Technologies Inc. acquisition.
 
(g)
        
The company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M's net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
 
*      Including acquisitions Europe, Middle East and Africa includes a 5.4% benefit.
 
*Including acquisitions Health Care includes a 5.6% benefit, related to numerous acquisitions, and a 4.3% benefit from new supply agreements with the new owners of the company's branded pharmaceutical business; Safety, Security and Protection Services includes a 10.1% benefit from acquisitions, primarily Security Printing and Systems Limited, which was acquired in August 2006.
 
Effective
in the first quarter of 2007, 3M made certain changes to its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. Two of the more significant changes were:
 - 
                 
The merging of a number of formerly separate Track and Trace efforts into one concerted effort for future growth, resulting in the transfer of certain businesses from both the Industrial and Transportation segment and Electro and Communications segment to the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment.
 - 
                 
3M's Visual Systems business (Consumer and Office segment) transferred to the Electro and Communications segment to leverage common markets, customers, suppliers and technologies.
 
Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect this new segment structure.
 
 
The following items impacted operating income results for the three months ended March 31, 2007. Refer to note (a) for discussion of the sale of 3M's global branded pharmaceuticals business, which
resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $786 million (reflected in Health Care segment). Refer to note (b) for discussion of restructuring actions. The Health Care segment included a net pre-tax gain of $7 million, which primarily related to adjustments to restructuring costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Electro and Communications segment includes a pre-tax restructuring charge of $19 million, primarily related to asset impairment charges. Refer to note (c) for discussion of the $121 million increase in environmental liabilities (reflected in Corporate and Unallocated).
 
(h)
        
3M adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R effective Jan. 1, 2006, using the modified retrospective method, with prior periods adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock option awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 1995.
 
(i)
            
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discloses non-GAAP results that exclude special items. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company provides reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial reporting to the most comparable GAAP reporting. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. Earnings per share and other amounts before special items are not measures recognized under GAAP. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Refer to the preceding "Supplemental Consolidated Statement of Income Information" for discussion of special items that impacted the first quarter of 2007. Refer to 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of special items that impacted 2006.
 
 
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provided guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. This interpretation was effective as of Jan. 1, 2007 and the cumulative effects, which were not material, of applying this interpretation were recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of Jan. 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on 3M's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
