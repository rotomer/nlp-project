Exhibit 99
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.
 October 19, 2007 - 3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced its sales and profit results for the third quarter of 2007.
 
The company posted record third-quarter sales of $6.2 billion, an increase of 5.5 percent. Sales rose 9.4 percent adjusted for recently divested businesses, primarily the company's branded pharmaceuticals business.
 
Third-quarter net income was a record $960 million, or $1.32 per share, versus $894 million, or $1.18 per share, in the third quarter of 2006. Net income and earnings per share increased 7.4 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. Included in these results is a net benefit from special items of $20 million, or $0.03 per share, in the third quarter of 2007, and a net gain of $10 million, or $0.01 per share, in last year's third quarter (items d-f).
 
The company's pharmaceuticals business, which was divested during the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, earned $0.07 per share in last year's third quarter. Excluding special items in both periods and excluding the 2006 earnings from the now-divested pharmaceuticals business, earnings per share increased 17 percent.
 
"The strength of the 3M portfolio was evident in the third quarter as we again generated record sales," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and CEO. "All of our businesses posted positive worldwide local-currency sales growth, led by a 17 percent increase in Health Care. Geographic diversity was also an important factor as all regions drove positive growth in local currencies, led by double-digit performances in Europe and Latin America. We leveraged this growth into a 12 percent improvement in earnings per share, and I would like to thank the entire 3M team for their hard work in achieving it."
 
Buckley continued. "Our growth plans remain on track and are gaining momentum. We continue to accelerate investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and in simplification of our supply chains, while maintaining superior returns. By leveraging 3M's many strengths, including market-leading global franchises, world-class technology to solve customer problems and an ever-expanding market presence, and combining them with an enthusiastic and talented workforce, we are well-positioned to take 3M to a higher level."

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share measures that exclude special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the company's operations. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007.
 
 
(a)
         
In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses. 3M received proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $68 million in the Display and Graphics segment in the second quarter of 2007. In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. 3M received proceeds of $817 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $786 million in the first quarter of 2007 (Health Care segment). In December 2006, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in the United States, Canada, and Latin America region and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. In connection with all of these transactions, 3M's Drug Delivery Systems Division (DDSD) entered into agreements whereby it became a source of supply to the acquiring companies. Because of the extent of 3M cash flows from these agreements in relation
 
to those of the disposed businesses, the operations of the branded pharmaceuticals business are not classified as discontinued operations.
 
(b)
        
Net pre-tax charges for the first nine months of 2007 that have been recorded to address remediation activities associated with perfluoronated compounds totaled $134 million. These expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
No adverse human health effects are caused by perfluoronated compounds at current levels of exposure. This conclusion is supported by a large body of research including laboratory studies and epidemiology studies of exposed employees. This research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and
shared with the EPA and global scientific-community.
 
(c)
         
During the fourth quarter of 2006 and first six months of 2007, management approved and committed to undertake restructuring actions. Net pre-tax restructuring charges for the first nine months of 2007 totaled $45 million. These charges primarily related to fixed asset impairments and employee-related restructuring liabilities, with the majority related to the phase-out of operations at a New Jersey roofing granule facility (Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). These charges are primarily recorded in cost of sales in the business segment where the expenses were incurred.
 
(d)
        
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $26 million related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit capabilities. This charge related to employee reductions and fixed asset impairments in the Electro and Communications business segment and was recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
(e)
         
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax gain of $52 million related to the sale of a Korean laboratory facility. The company plans to subsequently invest in a more modern, customer-oriented laboratory center in Korea. The gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2007.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
 
 
(f)
           
In the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, net income included gains due to a net benefit from certain income tax adjustments, which were partially offset by costs related to the Company's efforts to seek strategic alternatives for its branded pharmaceuticals business (recorded in Health Care) and for the first nine months were also partially offset by settlement costs related to an antitrust class action (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated). Refer to 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 25, 2007, which updated 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion of these items.
 
 
 
(g)
        
The change in prepaid pension and postretirement benefits, other liabilities, and total stockholders' equity when compared to September 30, 2006 was partially due to the adoption of SFAS No. 158. As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." This standard required employers to recognize the under funded or over funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 158, the Company recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (which is part of stockholders' equity) of approximately $1.9 billion and reversed prepaid pension and postretirement benefit long-term assets of approximately $2.5 billion. Other liabilities, including the impact of deferred taxes, decreased by approximately $0.6 billion. This change impacted the Consolidated Balance Sheet only, with no impact to net income or cash flows.
 
(h) The goodwill, intangible assets and other assets increase when compared to September 30, 2006 primarily relates to acquisitions.
 
 
 
 
(i)
            
Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of performance and uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
 
                       
Net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash payments associated with certain current and prior period special items as follows:
1.
              
Third-quarter 2007 was negatively impacted by approximately $37 million in tax payments related to the sale of our global branded pharmaceuticals business.
2.
              
Second-quarter 2007 was negatively impacted by approximately $110 million in tax payments related to the sale of our global branded pharmaceuticals business.
3.
              
First-quarter 2007 was negatively impacted by approximately $394 million in tax payments related to the sale of our global branded pharmaceuticals business.
 
(j)
            
The company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M's net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
(1)   Including acquisitions  Europe, Middle East and Africa includes a 3.7% benefit
 
(2)   Including acquisitions  Health Care includes a 4.6% benefit, related to numerous acquisitions, and a 4.5% benefit from supply agreements with the new owners of the Company's branded pharmaceutical business; Safety, Security and Protection Services includes a 5.8% benefit from numerous acquisitions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)   Including acquisitions  Europe, Middle East and Africa includes a 5.1% benefit
 
(4)   Including acquisitions  Health Care includes a 4.9% benefit, related to numerous acquisitions, and a 4.8% benefit from supply agreements with the new owners of the Company's branded pharmaceutical business; Safety, Security and Protection Services includes a 9.1% benefit from acquisitions, primarily Security Printing and Systems Limited, which was acquired in August 2006.
 
 
Effective
in the first quarter of 2007, 3M made certain changes to its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect this new segment structure.
Refer to 3M's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007 for further discussion of these changes.
 
 
For the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2007, refer to the preceding notes (a) through (e) and the preceding reconciliation of operating income by business segment for a discussion and summary of items that impacted reported business segment operating income. For the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2006, refer to the preceding note (f) for a discussion of special items that impacted reported operating income.
 
 
 
 
(k)
         
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company also discloses non-GAAP results that exclude special items. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company provides reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial reporting to the most comparable GAAP reporting. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. Earnings per share and other amounts before special items are not measures recognized under GAAP. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Refer to the preceding "Supplemental Consolidated Statement of Income Information" for discussion of special items that impacted the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.
