FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.
 July 24, 2008 - 3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced second-quarter sales of $6.7 billion, an increase of 9.7 percent over second quarter of 2007.  Net income was $945 million, or $1.33 per share, versus $917 million, or $1.25 per share in the corresponding period last year.  Excluding special items in both 2007 and 2008 (a-e), net income in the second quarter of 2008 was $991 million, or $1.39 per share, versus $899 million, or $1.23 per share, in 2007, increases of 10.3 percent and 13 percent, respectively.
 
"The strength of 3M's global portfolio was evident in the second quarter," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and CEO. "3M's three largest businesses, Industrial and Transportation, Health Care and Safety, Security and Protection Services, grew at double-digit rates.  Our record sales and earnings for the second quarter are a remarkable achievement by 3M employees around the globe, given the tough economic conditions we have seen in the U.S. and the changing dynamics in the optical films industry."

This news release contains forward-looking information (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) about the company's financial results and estimates, business prospects, and products under development that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "will," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (1) worldwide economic conditions; (2) competitive conditions and customer preferences; (3) foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; (4) the timing and acceptance of new product offerings; (5) the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); (6) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; (7) generating fewer productivity improvements than estimated; and (8) legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 (the "Reports"). Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. A further description of these factors is located in the Reports under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A (Annual Report) and in Part II, Item 1A (Quarterly Report).

About 3M
 
A recognized leader in research and development, 3M produces thousands of innovative products for dozens of diverse markets. 3M's core strength is applying its more than 40 distinct technology platforms  often in combination  to a wide array of customer needs. With $24 billion in sales, 3M employs 79,000 people worldwide and has operations in more than 60 countries.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share measures that exclude special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the company's operations. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2008.
 
(a)
         
In June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software, a 3M company, to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the second quarter of 2008 (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). This pre-tax loss was reported on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 3M's tax basis in HighJump Software was significantly lower than its book value, primarily related to the treatment of acquired goodwill. This resulted in a gain for tax purposes, which increased the provision for income taxes by $9 million.
 
(b)
        
In the second quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $19 million related to exit activities. These charges related to employee reductions at an Industrial and Transportation manufacturing facility located in the United Kingdom. These charges were recorded in cost of sales.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and six-months ended June 30, 2008.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2007.
 
(c)
         
In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses. 3M received proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $68 million in the Display and Graphics segment in the second quarter of 2007. In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. 3M received proceeds of $817 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $786 million in the first quarter of 2007 (Health Care segment).
 
(d)
        
During the fourth quarter of 2006 and first six months of 2007, management approved and committed to undertake restructuring actions. In the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax restructuring charge of $33 million. This charge primarily related to fixed asset impairments and employee-related restructuring liabilities, with the majority related to the phase-out of operations at a New Jersey roofing granule facility (Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). Net pre-tax restructuring charges for the first six months of 2007 totaled $45 million. These charges are primarily recorded in cost of sales in the business segment where the expenses were incurred.
 
(e)
         
During the second quarter of 2007, 3M signed a consent agreement with the state of Minnesota to address potential sources of perfluoronated compounds near former waste disposal sites in the East St. Paul Metro area. Under this agreement, the Company will provide the state of Minnesota funds for the state's work at a former municipal landfill and to assist the state with its own environmental research of this chemistry, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $13 million. This was an increase to the $121 million accrual that 3M made in the first quarter of 2007 to address remediation activities associated with perfluoronated compounds. These expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
No adverse human health effects are caused by perfluoronated compounds at current levels of exposure.  This conclusion is supported by a large body of research including laboratory studies and epidemiology studies of exposed employees. This research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and shared with the EPA and global scientific-community.
 
Refer to 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 19, 2008, which updated 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 15, 2008, for further discussion of these previously disclosed 2007 items.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and six-months ended June 30, 2007.
 
 
 
(f)
           
Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of performance and uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
 
"Net cash provided by operating activities" and "Free Cash Flow" were negatively impacted in 2007 by the timing of cash tax payments associated with special items. Tax payments related to the sale of our global branded pharmaceuticals business negatively impacted total year 2007 net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow by $628 million, with the impacts by quarter as follows: fourth-quarter 2007 ($87 million), third-quarter 2007 ($37 million), second-quarter 2007 ($110 million) and first-quarter 2007 ($394 million).
 
(g)
        
The company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M's net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
 
(h)   Including acquisitions  Europe, Middle East and Africa includes a 3.7% benefit from acquisitions; Asia Pacific includes a 1.0% benefit from acquisitions; Latin America and Canada includes a 4.7% benefit from acquisitions.
 
(i)
            
Including acquisitions  Industrial and Transportation includes a 4.2% benefit from acquisitions; Health Care includes a 1.1% benefit from acquisitions; Consumer and Office includes a 0.7% benefit from acquisitions; Safety, Security and Protection Services includes a 19.8% benefit from acquisitions, primarily related to the April 2008 acquisition of Aearo; Electro and Communications includes a 0.4% benefit from acquisitions.
 
(j)    Including acquisitions  Europe, Middle East and Africa includes a 2.6% benefit from acquisitions; Asia Pacific includes a 0.6% benefit from acquisitions; Latin America and Canada includes a 3.0% benefit from acquisitions.
