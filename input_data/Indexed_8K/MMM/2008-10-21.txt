Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The sole purpose of this Current Report is to correct a typographical error contained in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today on October 21, 2008, furnishing the press release reporting its sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. In the section titled "Key Financial Highlights," the word "billion" in the first part of the fourth sentence should be "million", so the correct sentence reads "Third-quarter net income was $999 million, or $1.42 per share, versus $940 million, or $1.29 per share, in the third quarter of 2007, excluding special items in both periods."
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
