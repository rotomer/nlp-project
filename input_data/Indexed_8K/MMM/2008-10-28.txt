ST. PAUL, Minn.
 On Oct. 21, 2008, 3M (NYSE: MMM) announced third-quarter sales of $6.6 billion, an increase of 6.2 percent over third quarter of 2007. Net income was $991 million, or $1.41 per share, versus $960 million, or $1.32 per share in the corresponding period last year, increases of 3.2 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. These results include special items (a-h) that impacted both 2008 and 2007.
 
"Our diversified business portfolio served us well in the third quarter, as 3M employees once again delivered consistent results with 23 percent-plus operating margins in a highly challenging economic environment," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and CEO. "Our many category-defining brands, 40-plus technology platforms, unmatched global distribution capability and relentless focus on our customers drove consistent and highly profitable growth."
 
The company posted double-digit sales growth in its three largest businesses, namely Safety, Security and Protection Services, Health Care and Industrial and Transportation.
 
Segment trends were very similar to the first half of 2008 with continued growth across the company's international operations.  3M sales in Latin America increased 26 percent over last year, while Europe and Canada achieved 8 percent and 9 percent sales growth, respectively.  Sales in Asia Pacific were down 1 percent, or up 13 percent excluding the impact of the secular transition underway in the company's optical film business.
 
"Our diversified global business model has enabled us to weather many economic storms and to also take advantage of opportunities when our competitors could not," Buckley added. "For example, 3M started 15 successful new international companies during the recession of the 1970s, and we aggressively built strength and gained market share in Asia during the late-1990s. We are poised again to take full advantage of market opportunities presented by the current environment and to emerge more competitive and successful than ever before."
Key Financial Highlights
 
Third-quarter worldwide sales totaled $6.6 billion, an increase of 6.2 percent over last year. Local-currency sales including acquisitions increased 4.4 percent, and foreign exchange impacts added 2.1 points to growth in the quarter. Local-currency sales including acquisitions increased 27.7 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 9.2 percent in Health Care, 7.1 percent in Industrial and Transportation, 3.7 percent in Consumer and Office, 0.2 percent in Electro and Communications, but declined 17.7 percent in Display and Graphics due to the secular transition in the company's optical films business.  Third-quarter net income was $991 million, or $1.41 per share, versus $960 million, or $1.32 per share, in the third quarter of 2007. Net income and earnings per share increased 3.2 percent and 6.8 percent respectively, including special items (a-h).
 
For the first nine months of 2008, sales increased 8.2 percent to $19.8 billion, driven by a 3.9 percent increase in local-currency sales, including acquisitions.  Year-to-date earnings were $4.11 per share, compared to $4.42 per share in 2007, including special items (a-h) in both periods.

About 3M
 
A recognized leader in research and development, 3M produces thousands of innovative products for dozens of diverse markets. 3M's core strength is applying its more than 40 distinct technology platforms  often in combination  to a wide array of customer needs. With $24 billion in sales, 3M employs 79,000 people worldwide and has operations in more than 60 countries.
The following special items impacted results for the  three months and nine months ended September 30, 2008. Special items that impacted three months ended September 30, 2008 results (items b and c) reduced operating income and net income by $8 million, and reduced earnings by $0.01 per diluted share. Special items that impacted nine months ended September 30, 2008 results (items a-c) reduced operating income by $50 million, reduced net income by $54 million, and reduced earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.
 
(a)
         
In June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software, a 3M company, to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the second quarter of 2008 (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). This pre-tax loss was reported on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 3M's tax basis in HighJump Software was significantly lower than its book value, primarily related to the treatment of acquired goodwill. This resulted in a gain for tax purposes, which increased the provision for income taxes by $9 million.
 
(b)
        
During the third quarter of 2008, management approved and committed to undertake certain exit activities, which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $49 million. This charge primarily related to employee-related liabilities and fixed asset impairments, with actions taken in Display and Graphics, Industrial and Transportation, Health Care, Safety, Security and Protection Services, and Corporate. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $19 million related to exit activities. These charges related to employee reductions at an Industrial and Transportation manufacturing facility located in the United Kingdom.
 
(c)
         
In March 2008, 3M entered into a sale-leaseback relative to an administrative location in Italy. 3M anticipates leasing back the facility through late 2009 at which time a new location will be utilized. Because only a small portion of the proceeds were received through June 2008 coupled with required deferral of a portion of the gain from the sale over the leaseback period, no material gain was recorded until the remaining proceeds were received in September 2008. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately 29 million Euros ($41 million) in the third quarter of 2008, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2008, charges which reduced operating income by business segment were as follows:  Industrial and Transportation ($11 million), Health Care ($10 million), Display and Graphics ($20 million), Safety, Security and Protection Services ($3 million) and Corporate and Unallocated ($5 million).  Corporate and Unallocated also includes a $41 million gain for the three-months ended September 30, 2008. In addition to the preceding first three months 2008 items, first nine months 2008 also includes charges which reduced operating income by business segments as follows: Industrial and Transportation ($19 million) and Safety, Security and Protection Services ($23 million).
The following special items impacted results for the  three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007. Special items that impacted three months ended September 30, 2007 results (items g and h) increased operating income by $26 million, increased net income by $20 million, and increased earnings by $0.03 per diluted share. Special items that impacted nine months ended September 30, 2007 results (items d-h) increased operating income by $701million, increased net income by $460 million, and increased earnings by $0.63 per diluted share.
 
(d)
        
In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses. 3M received proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $68 million in the Display and Graphics segment in the second quarter of 2007. In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. 3M received proceeds of $817 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $786 million in the first quarter of 2007 (Health Care segment).
 
(e)
         
Net pre-tax charges for the first nine months of 2007 that have been recorded to address remediation activities associated with perfluoronated compounds totaled $134 million. These expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
No adverse human health effects are caused by perfluoronated compounds at current levels of exposure.  This conclusion is supported by a large body of research including laboratory studies and epidemiology studies of exposed employees. This research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and shared with the EPA and global scientific-community.
 
(f)
           
During the fourth quarter of 2006 and first six months of 2007, management approved and committed to undertake restructuring actions. Net pre-tax restructuring charges for the first nine months of 2007 totaled $45 million. These charges primarily related to fixed asset impairments and employee-related restructuring liabilities, with the majority related to the phase-out of operations at a New Jersey roofing granule facility (Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). These charges are primarily recorded in cost of sales in the business segment where the expenses were incurred.
 
(g)
        
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $26 million related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit capabilities. This charge related to employee reductions and fixed asset impairments in the Electro and Communications business segment and was recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
(h)
        
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax gain of $52 million related to the sale of a Korean laboratory facility. The gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
As discussed in items g and h above, for the three months ended September 30, 2007, charges which reduced operating income totaled $26 million in Electro and Communications, while gains that increased operating income totaled $52 million in Corporate and Unallocated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, which includes items d through h, net charges which reduced operating income by business segment were as follows:  Industrial and Transportation ($2 million), Safety, Security and Protection Services ($29 million), Electro and Communications ($45 million) and Corporate and Unallocated ($82 million). Net gains, which increased operating income, were recorded in Health Care ($795 million) and Display and Graphics ($64 million).
