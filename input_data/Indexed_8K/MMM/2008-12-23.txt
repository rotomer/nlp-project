Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangement of Certain Officers
 
(e) Compensatory Arrangement of Certain Officers
 
On December 19, 2008, 3M Company adopted and approved amended and restated plan documents for the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plan I ("Plan I") and the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plan II ("Plan II"). The effective date of these amended and restated plan documents is January 1, 2009.
 
The following is a summary of the material terms of Plan I and Plan II (the "Plans") and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full terms of the amended and restated plan documents, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.
 
(1)           The purpose of the Plans is to provide additional pension benefits to those of the Company's U.S. employees whose benefits under 3M's qualified pension plan are restricted by various tax law limits.
 
(2)           Participation in the Plans is limited to employees of 3M Company and its U.S. subsidiaries who participate in the Company's qualified pension plan and whose benefits under such plan are limited by reason of various federal tax law limits applicable to such plan.
 
(3)           The additional pension benefits payable by the Plans are generally the amount by which the pension benefits that would be paid by the Company's qualified pension plan if such benefits were not limited by reason of such federal tax law limits exceed the amount of pension benefits actually payable by such qualified pension plan.
 
(4)           A participant in the Plans who is not entitled to a vested benefit under 3M's qualified pension plan is not entitled to receive any benefit under the Plans unless and until such participant's benefits under the qualified pension plan become vested.
 
(5)           Neither Plan I nor Plan II will be funded by the Company, and all amounts payable under the Plans will be paid from the general assets of 3M Company. The rights of each participant under the Plans will be no greater than the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
 
(6)           All of a participant's benefits under both Plan I and Plan II are generally payable in the form of a lump sum cash payment following the participant's separation from service with the Company (subject to a 6-month delay for certain employees as required by section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). Certain participants were allowed a one-time opportunity to elect to receive payment of their Plan I and Plan II benefits in the form of a life annuity following their retirement from employment with the Company.
 
(7)           Both Plans may be amended or terminated at any time by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors of 3M Company. However, no amendment of the Plans may adversely affect the rights of participants acquired under the terms of the Plans in effect prior to the amendment.

Exhibit 10.1
 
ARTICLE I:  INTRODUCTION
 
1.01             
Title
 
This plan shall be known as the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plan I (hereinafter the "Nonqualified Plan I").
 
1.02             
Purpose
 
The purpose of this Nonqualified Plan I is to provide retirement benefits to participants and their beneficiaries in the 3M Employee Retirement Income Plan (hereinafter "ERIP") which such ERIP is unable to provide solely because of the limitations imposed by section 415 of the Code.  This Nonqualified Plan I is intended to supplement the ERIP originally adopted by 3M in 1931 and as amended from time to time thereafter.
 
1.03             
History
 
3M originally adopted a nonqualified pension plan on November 7, 1978.  This original plan was named the Supplemental Pension Plan of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (hereinafter the "Supplemental Plan").  The Supplemental Plan was amended from time to time after its adoption.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Supplemental Plan was amended and restated as two separate plans:  the "Nonqualified Pension Plan I of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company" and "Nonqualified Pension Plan II of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company".  The provisions of the restatements superseded all prior versions of the Supplemental Plan.  Such restatements have been amended from time to time since their adoption.  Nonqualified Plan I provides supplemental benefits that are strictly in excess of section 415 of the Code.  Nonqualified Plan II provided certain additional supplemental retirement benefits, but effective January 1, 2009, such plan has been amended to provide supplemental retirement benefits that are strictly in excess of limitations under section 401(a)(17) and 402(g) of the Code.
 
1.04             
Effect
 
Effective January 1, 2009, this Nonqualified Plan I is hereby again amended and restated.  The provisions of this restatement
 
supersede all prior versions of the Plan.  The purpose of this restatement is to bring the Plan into compliance with section 409A of the Code by "de-linking" the payment provisions under this Plan from the payment provisions under the ERIP.  From October 3, 2004 (the date section 409A was added to the Code) through December 31, 2008, the Plan continued to operate with "linked" payment provisions in accordance with special transition rules issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with the implementation of section 409A of the Code.  For avoidance of doubt, this restatement is intended to apply both to deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code (., deferred compensation credited under the Plan which related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1, 2005), as well as deferred compensation credited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or before December 31, 2004 that is eligible to be "grandfathered" from application of section 409A of the Code.  However, the benefits payable to Members and Former Members (and their Beneficiaries) who commenced payment of their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit prior to January 1, 2009 will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan in effect at the time of their benefit commencement and will not be adjusted or recomputed to reflect this or any subsequent amendment or restatement of this Nonqualified Plan I.

ARTICLE IV:  AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS

Additional Monthly Benefit
 
In addition to the amount of Retirement Income payable to a Member or Former Member under the ERIP, this Nonqualified Plan I shall pay an additional monthly benefit to such Member or Former Member equal to the amount by which (a) exceeds (b), where:
 
                (a)           is the monthly Retirement Income that would have been payable to such Member or Former Member by the ERIP if that plan's benefits were not limited in accordance with the provisions of section 415 of the Code; and
 
                (b)           is the monthly Retirement Income actually payable to such Member or Former Member under the ERIP.
 
Such additional benefit shall be referred to herein as the "Nonqualified Plan I Benefit".  For avoidance of doubt, a Member or Former Member who is not entitled to a vested benefit under the ERIP shall not be entitled to any Nonqualified Plan I Benefit hereunder unless and until such benefit under the ERIP becomes vested.
 
4.02             
Time of Payment
 
Payment of the Nonqualified Plan I Benefit described in Section 4.01 above will begin as of the first of the calendar month (the "Annuity Starting Date") coincident with or next following the Member's  Separation from Service; provided, however, that:
 
                (a)           Members whose job grades were classified as CEO, L1, L2, L3 and T7 whose planned income for 2008 was more than $230,000 were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  If a timely election was made in 2008, payment of such Member's Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall commence as of the Annuity Starting Date coincident with or next following the Member's Retirement.  If such Member Separates from Service prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, his or her Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum as of the Annuity Starting Date coincident with or next following the Member's Separation from Service;
 
                (b)           One Member classified as L3 on Transitional Retirement Leave who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2008 was permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to receive his Nonqualified Plan I Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  Such Member did in fact timely elect, and accordingly, his Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall commence upon his scheduled date of termination given in Schedule I attached hereto (which shall be treated as a Retirement for purposes of Section 4.03(b));
 
                (c)           Former Members classified as L1 and L2 who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2009 were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  If a timely election was made in 2008, payment of their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the Former Member's attainment of age sixty five (65);
 
                (d)           All other Former Members who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2009 and who have not commenced payment of their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit prior to January 1, 2009 shall receive payment of their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit in January, 2009 in a single lump sum.  (For this purpose, the Member's Annuity Starting Date shall be January 1, 2009.)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Member is a Specified Employee, payment on account of Separation from Service shall begin as of the first day of the seventh month following the Member's Separation, and the first payment shall include all payments delayed since the Annuity Starting Date (accordingly, if payment is in the form of an annuity, such annuity shall be
 
calculated based on the Annuity Starting Date without regard to the delay).
 
4.03             
Form of Payment
 
(a)           .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.03, the Nonqualified Plan I Benefit payable to each Member or Former Member under this Plan shall be paid in a single lump sum, determined by converting the monthly Nonqualified Plan I Benefit amount in Section 4.01 into a present value lump sum using the applicable interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities and RP2000 3M mortality.  For purposes of this conversion, the "applicable interest rate" shall mean the average of the daily rates on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities in effect during the calendar quarter first preceding the calendar quarter that ends immediately prior to the Annuity Starting Date.
Lump Sum
 
(b)           .  Members whose job grades were classified as CEO, L1, L2, L3 and T7 whose planned income for 2008 was more than $230,000, and one Member classified as job grade L3 on TSR (collectively, "Annuity Eligible Members"), were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  If a timely election was made in 2008, the rules under this Section 4.03(b) shall apply.  If an Eligible Member dies or Separates from Service prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, his or her Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum pursuant to Section 4.03(a).
Optional Annuity Forms for Eligible Retirees
 
(i)        .  If an Annuity Eligible Member Retires and is not legally married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, then the normal form of payment of his or her Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall be the Life Annuity form, and his or her Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall, unless he or she elects to waive the Life Annuity form of payment and selects a Joint and Nonspouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form, be paid in the form of a Life Annuity. Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, Nonqualified Plan I Benefit payments will be made monthly to a Member or Former Member commencing on his or her Annuity Starting Date and ending on the first day of the month in which his or her death occurs.
Presumed Form:  Single Life Annuity
 
(ii)       .  If an Annuity Eligible Member Retires and is legally married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, then his or her Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall be paid in the form of a 50% Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form, unless he or she elects to waive the 50% Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form and selects either the Life Annuity form, an alternative Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form available under the ERIP (., 75% or 100%) or a Joint and Nonspouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form available under the ERIP (50%, 75% or 100%).
Presumed Form:  Joint and Survivor Life Annuity
i.e
 
(c)           .  Certain Former Members classified as L1 or L2 who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2009 were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit in the Life Annuity form or the Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form (50% or 75%).  If a timely election was made in 2008, then the Former Member's Nonqualified Plan I Benefit shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following attainment of age sixty five (65) in the annuity form elected (in lieu of a single lump sum).
Optional Annuity Forms for Certain Vested Former Members
 
(d)           .  To the extent that a Member's or Former Member's Retirement Income is calculated pursuant to Article XIII of the ERIP (Portfolio II), he or she shall be entitled to a Total Pension Value Guarantee (as determined under Section 13.10 of the ERIP, as the same may be amended from time to time) if he or she Retires and elects payment in the form of a Life Annuity, Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Annuity or Joint and Non-Spouse Beneficiary Annuity under Section 4.03(b) or (c) of this Plan, so long as the Total Pension Value Guarantee with respect to the Nonqualified Plan I Benefit qualifies as a cash refund feature under which payment is provided upon the death of the last annuitant in an amount that is not greater than the excess of the Total Pension Value with respect to the Nonqualified Plan I Benefit at the Annuity Starting Date over the total of payments before the death of the last annuitant.
Total Pension Value Guarantee
 
(e)           .  If a Member or Former Member is entitled to elect a subsidized 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity under Section 3.10 of the ERIP (as the same may be amended from time to time), he or she shall also
Subsidized 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity
 
be entitled to a subsidized annuity under this Plan if he or she elects the 50% Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Annuity pursuant to Section 4.03(b) or (c), provided that the annual lifetime annuity benefit available to such Member is not greater than the annual lifetime annuity benefit available under the Life Annuity form, and provided that the annual survivor annuity benefit is not greater than the annual lifetime annuity benefit available to such Member under the 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity form.
 
(f)            .  For purposes of this Article IV, the terms Life Annuity, Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity, Joint and Nonspouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity and Total Pension Value Guarantee shall have the same meanings as under the ERIP, as the same may be amended from time to time.
Definitions
 
4.04              .
Pre-Commencement Death
 
Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, if a Member or Former Member dies after becoming vested under the ERIP but prior to his or her Annuity Starting Date, the following rules shall apply:
 
(a)           To the extent that a Member's or Former Member's Retirement Income is calculated pursuant to Article III of the ERIP (Portfolio I), and if the Member or Former Member is married, his or her surviving spouse shall be entitled a "Preretirement Survivor Annuity" determined in the same manner as provided under Section 3.07 of the ERIP, as amended from time to time, with respect to the Member's or Former Member's Nonqualified Plan I Benefit.  Such Preretirement Survivor Annuity shall be converted into a present value lump sum, using the interest and mortality factors in Section 4.03(a), and paid as of the first day of the calendar month following the Member's or Former Member's death;
 
(b)           To the extent that a Member's or Former Member's Retirement Income is calculated pursuant to Article III of the ERIP (Portfolio I), and if the Member or Former Member is not married, no benefit shall be payable under this Plan, and
 
(c)           To the extent that a Member's or Former Member's Retirement Income is calculated pursuant to Article XIII of the ERIP (Portfolio II), and if such Member or Former Member dies prior to his or her Annuity Starting Date, his or her Beneficiary shall receive the Member's or Former Member's
 
Nonqualified Plan I Benefit attributable to Portfolio II an immediate single lump sum, determined by converting the monthly Nonqualified Plan I Benefit amount in Section 4.01 into a present value lump sum using the interest and mortality factors in Section 4.03(a).  For this purpose, the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the Member's death shall be treated as the Annuity Starting Date.
 
4.05             
Beneficiary
 
                (a)           .  An Annuity Eligible Member or Former Member shall be entitled to designate a Beneficiary to receive the survivor income portion of the Joint and Non-Spouse Beneficiary Annuity, if selected, on forms furnished by and filed with 3M.

                (b)           .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any pre-commencement death benefit payable under Section 4.04(c) above, the Member's or Former Member's beneficiary designation under the ERIP shall apply.  In all events, in the absence of a designation or if such designation fails, the rules for automatic beneficiaries under the ERIP shall apply.
Total Pension Value
 
4.06             
Incapacity
 
If a Member, Former Member or Beneficiary is under a legal disability or, by reason of illness or mental or physical disability, is in the opinion of the Plan Administrator unable to attend properly to his or her personal financial matters, this Nonqualified Plan I may pay the benefits payable hereunder in such of the following ways as the Plan Administrator shall direct:
 
                (a)           Directly to such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary;
 
                (b)           To the legal representative of such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary; or

ARTICLE V:  UNFUNDED PLAN
 
5.01             
No Trust
 
The benefits payable under this Nonqualified Plan I shall be paid solely from the general assets of 3M.  3M does not intend to create any trust in connection with this Nonqualified Plan I.  Neither 3M nor any other employer shall have any obligation to make contributions or set aside funds in order to pay such benefits.  3M's obligation under this Nonqualified Plan I shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.

additional federal, state and local income taxes paid on the additional amount, shall be equal to the value of the retirement benefits distributed to such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary pursuant to this Article IX.  Such tax gross-up payment shall be made no later than the end of the recipient's taxable year following the taxable year in which the recipient remits the related taxes.  If a Member is a Specified Employee and such gross-up payment is made on account of the Member's Separation from Service, payment shall not be made prior to the first day of the seventh month following the Member's Separation from Service.
 
9.05             
Fees and Expenses
 
3M shall pay to each Member, Former Member and Beneficiary the amount of all reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses incurred by such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary in seeking to obtain or enforce his or her rights under this Article IX or in connection with any income tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code to the payments made pursuant to this Article IX, unless a lawsuit commenced by the Member, Former Member or Beneficiary for such purposes is dismissed by the court as being spurious or frivolous.  3M shall also pay to each Member, Former Member and Beneficiary the amount of all reasonable tax and financial planning fees and expenses incurred by such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary in connection with the receipt by such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary of payments pursuant to this Article IX.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 
 
 
ARTICLE I:  INTRODUCTION
 
1.01       
Title
 
This plan shall be known as the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plan II (hereinafter the "Nonqualified Plan II").
 
1.02       
Purpose
 
The purpose of this Nonqualified Plan II is to provide retirement benefits to a select group of participants and their beneficiaries in the 3M Employee Retirement Income Plan (hereinafter "ERIP") which such ERIP is unable to provide solely because of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code and section 402(g) of the Code.  This Nonqualified Plan II is not intended to duplicate the retirement benefits provided under the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plan I.
 
1.03       
History
 
3M originally adopted a nonqualified pension plan on November 7, 1978.  This original plan was named the Supplemental Pension Plan of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (hereinafter the "Supplemental Plan").  The Supplemental Plan was amended from time to time after its adoption.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Supplemental Plan was amended and restated as two separate plans:  the "Nonqualified Pension Plan I of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company" and "Nonqualified Pension Plan II of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company".  The provisions of the restatements superseded all prior versions of the Supplemental Plan.  Such restatements have been amended from time to time since their adoption.  Nonqualified Plan I provides supplemental benefits that are strictly in excess of section 415 of the Code.  Nonqualified Plan II provided certain additional supplemental retirement benefits, but effective January 1, 2009, such plan is hereby amended to provide supplemental retirement benefits that are strictly in excess of limitations under section 401(a)(17) and 402(g) of the Code.
 
1.04       
Effect
 
Effective January 1, 2009, this Nonqualified Plan II is hereby again amended and restated.  The provisions of this restatement supersede all prior versions of the Plan.  The purpose of this restatement is twofold:  (1) to limit the supplemental retirement benefits hereunder to benefits that are strictly in excess of the limitations under section 401(a)(17) and section 402(g) of the Code, and (2) to bring the Plan into compliance with section 409A of the Code by "de-linking" the payment provisions under this Plan from the payment provisions under the ERIP.  From October 3, 2004 (the date section 409A was added to the Code) through December 31, 2008, the Plan continued to operate with "linked" payment provisions in accordance with special transition rules issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with the implementation of section 409A of the Code.  For avoidance of doubt, this restatement is intended to apply both to deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code (deferred compensation credited under the Plan which related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1, 2005), as well as deferred compensation credited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or before December 31, 2004 that is eligible to be "grandfathered" from application of section 409A of the Code.  However, the benefits payable to Members and Former Members (and their Beneficiaries) who commenced payment of their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit prior to January 1, 2009 will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan in effect at the time of their benefit commencement and will not be adjusted or recomputed to reflect this or any subsequent amendment or restatement of this Nonqualified Plan II.

ARTICLE IV:  AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
 
4.01       
Additional Monthly Benefit
 
In addition to the amount of Retirement Income payable to a Member or Former Member under the ERIP, this Nonqualified Plan II shall pay an additional monthly benefit to such Member or Former Member determined in accordance with this Section 4.01.  Such additional benefit shall be referred to herein as the "Nonqualified Plan II Benefit".
 
                (a)           The Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall equal the amount by which (i) exceeds (ii), where:
 
                                (i)  is the monthly Retirement Income that would have been payable to such Member or Former Member by the ERIP if Salaried Pension Earnings were not limited (1) by application of section 401(a)(17) of the Code or (2) by reason of the Member's or Former Member's participation in the 3M VIP Excess Plan (as described in Section 4.01(b) below); and
 
                                (ii)  is the monthly Retirement Income actually payable to such Member or Former Member under the ERIP.
 
                (b)           For purposes of this determination, the following rules shall apply:
 
                                (i)            Planned total compensation (for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2008) or wages and salaries (for
 
Plan Years ending on or before December 31, 2007) that is not voluntarily deferred under a 3M nonqualified deferred compensation plan and which is excluded from Salaried Pension Earnings under the ERIP solely by reason of application of the section 401(a)(17) limit shall be treated as Salaried Pension Earnings.
 
                                (ii)           Planned total compensation (for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2008) or wages and salaries (for Plan Years ending on or before December 31, 2007) that is voluntarily deferred under a 3M nonqualified deferred compensation plan and which, absent such deferral, would be excluded from Salaried Pension Earnings by reason of application of the section 401(a)(17) limit shall be treated as Salaried Pension Earnings.
 
                                (iii)          Planned total compensation (for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2009) that does not exceed the section 401(a)(17) limit but which is excluded from Salaried Pension Earnings under the ERIP because it is deferred under the 3M VIP Excess Plan by reason of application of the limit on regular (non-catch up) VIP deferrals under section 402(g) of the Code ($15,500 for 2008, as adjusted from time to time for cost-of-living increases) shall be treated as Salaried Pension Earnings.
 
The amount of the Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall be reduced by the amount of the additional monthly benefit payable to the same person under the Nonqualified Plan I to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits.  For avoidance of doubt, a Member or Former Member who is not entitled to a vested benefit under the ERIP shall not be entitled to any Nonqualified Plan II Benefit hereunder unless and until such benefit under the ERIP becomes vested.
 
4.02       
Time of Payment
 
Payment of the Nonqualified Plan II Benefit described in Section 4.01 above will begin as of the first of the calendar month (the "Annuity Starting Date") coincident with or next following the Member's  Separation from Service; provided, however, that:
 
                (a)           Members whose job grades were classified as CEO, L1, L2, L3 and T7 whose planned income for 2008 was more than $230,000 were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to
 
elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  If a timely election was made in 2008, payment of such Member's Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall commence as of the Annuity Starting Date coincident with or next following the Member's Retirement.  If such Member Separates from Service prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, his or her Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum as of the Annuity Starting Date coincident with or next following the Member's Separation from Service;
 
                (b)           One Member classified as L3 on Transitional Retirement Leave who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2008 was permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to receive his Nonqualified Plan II Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  Such Member did in fact timely elect, and accordingly, his Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall commence upon his scheduled date of termination given in Schedule I attached hereto (which shall be treated as a Retirement for purposes of Section 4.03(b));
 
                (c)           Former Members classified as L1 and L2 who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2009 were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  If a timely election was made in 2008, payment of their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the Former Member's attainment of age sixty five (65);
 
                (d)           All other Former Members who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2009 and who have not commenced payment of their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit prior to January 1, 2009 shall receive payment of their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit in January, 2009 in a single lump sum.  (For this purpose, the Member's Annuity Starting Date shall be January 1, 2009.)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Member is a Specified Employee, payment on account of Separation from Service shall begin as of the first day of the seventh month following the Member's Separation, and the first payment shall include all payments delayed since the Annuity Starting Date (accordingly, if payment is in the form of an annuity, such annuity shall be calculated based on the Annuity Starting Date without regard to the delay).
 
4.03       
Form of Payment
 
(a)           .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.03, the Nonqualified Plan II Benefit payable to each Member or Former Member under this Plan shall be paid in a single lump sum, determined by converting the monthly Nonqualified Plan II Benefit amount in Section 4.01 into a present value lump sum using the applicable interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities and RP2000 3M mortality.  For purposes of this conversion, the "applicable interest rate" shall mean the average of the daily rates on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities in effect during the calendar quarter first preceeding the calendar quarter that ends immediately prior to the Annuity Starting Date.
Lump Sum
 
(b)           .  Members whose job grades were classified as CEO, L1, L2, L3 and T7 whose planned income for 2008 was more than $230,000, and one Member classified as job grade L3 on TSR (collectively, "Annuity Eligible Members"), were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit in the form of an annuity in lieu of a lump sum.  If a timely election was made in 2008, the rules under this Section 4.03(b) shall apply.  If an Eligible Member dies or Separates from Service prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, his or her Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum pursuant to Section 4.03(a).
Optional Annuity Forms for Eligible Retirees
 
(i)        .  If an Annuity Eligible Member Retires and is not legally married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, then the normal form of payment of his or her Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall be the Life Annuity form, and his or her Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall, unless he or she elects to waive the Life Annuity form of payment and selects a Joint and Nonspouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form, be paid in the form of a Life Annuity. Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, Nonqualified Plan II Benefit payments will be made monthly to a Member or Former Member commencing on his or her Annuity Starting Date and ending on the first day of the month in which his or her death occurs.
Presumed Form:  Single Life Annuity
 
(ii)       .  If an Annuity Eligible Member Retires and is legally married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, then his or her Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall be paid in the form of a 50%
Presumed Form:  Joint and Survivor Life Annuity
 
Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form, unless he or she elects to waive the 50% Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form and selects either the Life Annuity form, an alternative Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form available under the ERIP (75% or 100%) or a Joint and Nonspouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form available under the ERIP (50%, 75% or 100%).
i.e., 
 
(c)           .  Certain Former Members classified as L1 or L2 who incurred a Separation from Service prior to 2009 (collectively, "Annuity Eligible Former Members") were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable election in 2008 to elect to receive their Nonqualified Plan II Benefit in the Life Annuity form or the Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity form (50% or 75%).  If a timely election was made in 2008, then the Former Member's Nonqualified Plan II Benefit shall commence upon the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following attainment of age sixty five (65) in the annuity form elected (in lieu of a single lump sum).
Optional Annuity Forms for Certain Vested Former Members
 
(d)           .  To the extent that a Member's or Former Member's Retirement Income is calculated pursuant to Article XIII of the ERIP (Portfolio II), he or she shall be entitled to a Total Pension Value Guarantee (as determined under Section 13.10 of the ERIP, as the same may be amended from time to time) if he or she Retires and elects payment in the form of a Life Annuity, Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Annuity or Joint and Non-Spouse Beneficiary Annuity under Section 4.03(b) or (c) of this Plan, so long as the Total Pension Value Guarantee with respect to the Nonqualified Plan II Benefit qualifies as a cash refund feature under which payment is provided upon the death of the last annuitant in an amount that is not greater than the excess of the Total Pension Value with respect to the Nonqualified Plan II Benefit at the Annuity Starting Date over the total of payments before the death of the last annuitant.
Total Pension Value Guarantee
 
(e)           .  If a Member or Former Member is entitled to elect a subsidized 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity under Section 3.10 of the ERIP (as the same may be amended from time to time), he or she shall also be entitled to a subsidized annuity under this Plan if he or she elects the 50% Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Annuity pursuant to Section 4.03(b) or (c), provided that the annual lifetime
Subsidized 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity
 
annuity benefit available to such Member is not greater than the annual lifetime annuity benefit available under the Life Annuity form, and provided that the annual survivor annuity benefit is not greater than the annual lifetime annuity benefit available to such Member under the 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity form.
 
(f)            .  For purposes of this Article IV, the terms Life Annuity, Joint and Spouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity, Joint and Nonspouse Beneficiary Survivor Annuity and Total Pension Value Guarantee shall have the same meanings as under the ERIP, as the same may be amended from time to time.

Tax Equalization
