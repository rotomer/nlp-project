FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.
 Jan. 29, 2009 - 3M (NYSE: MMM) today reported 2008 sales of $25.3 billion, an all-time record for the company. Sales were up 3.3 percent from a year ago.  Reported net income for 2008 was $3.5 billion, or $4.89 per share, versus $4.1 billion, or $5.60 per share, in 2007. Excluding special items (a-i), 2008 earnings were $5.17 per share versus $4.98 per share in 2007, up 3.8 percent.
 
Fourth-quarter sales were $5.5 billion, a decrease of 11.2 percent.  Fourth-quarter net income was $536 million, or $0.77 per share, versus $851 million, or $1.17 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding special items (a-i), net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $676 million, or $0.97 per share, versus $863 million, or $1.19 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
"3M drove record sales in 2008 despite a dramatic fourth-quarter economic downturn," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and CEO, "and we are responding to lower demand with aggressive cost management and operational discipline. 3M employees are doing an outstanding job managing through worldwide market challenges and are positioning our company to seize the upside when growth resumes."
 
Buckley continued, "We streamlined our operations throughout 2008 and we will continue to optimize to protect against the downside throughout 2009.  In addition, we plan to reduce capital expenditures by about 30 percent and aggressively attack working capital in order to conserve cash. Finally, we remain focused on gaining share by delighting our current customers and winning new ones. Throughout our 106-year history, we have weathered many economic storms, and expect to emerge from this one stronger and more competitive than ever."
 
Reflecting the ongoing global economic uncertainty and continued challenges in many of its end-markets, 3M adjusted its 2009 sales and earnings expectations. The company is now planning for organic sales volumes to decline between 5 percent and 9 percent in 2009, versus a previous planning assumption of negative 3 percent to negative 7 percent. As a result, the company is now planning for 2009 earnings to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.70 per share, down from a previous range of $4.50 to $4.95. These estimates exclude any potential special items.
 
Full-Year Key Financial Highlights
For the full-year 2008, sales increased 3.3 percent to $25.3 billion, driven by a 1.4 percent increase in local-currency sales, including acquisitions. Local-currency sales growth was led by 3M's three largest businesseswith growth of 18.3 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services; 6.8 percent in Health Care; and 4.6 percent in Industrial and Transportation.  Local-currency sales declined in the three remaining businesses, with Consumer and Office down 0.3 percent, Electro and Communications down 1.7 percent and Display and Graphics down 17.9 percent.  Sales in 3M's international operations grew 4 percent and now constitute 64 percent of total sales, the highest in 3M's history.
 
Full-year net income was $3.5 billion, or $4.89 per share, versus $4.1 billion or $5.60 per share in 2007.  Excluding special items (a-i), 2008 net income was $3.7 billion, or $5.17 per share, versus $3.6 billion, or $4.98 per share, in 2007.  Per-share earnings increased 3.8 percent on this basis.
 
Fourth Quarter Key Financial Highlights
Fourth-quarter worldwide sales totaled $5.5 billion, down 11.2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.

Local-currency sales including acquisitions increased in two businesses during the quarterup 13.2 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services and up 4.5 percent in Health Care.  Sales in local currencies for the other four 3M business segments dropped during the fourth quarter, with Industrial and Transportation down 6.3 percent, Consumer and Office down 6.5  percent, Electro and Communications down 12.3 percent, and Display and Graphics down 25.8 percent.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (1) worldwide economic and capital markets conditions; (2) competitive conditions and customer preferences; (3) foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; (4) the timing and acceptance of new product offerings; (5) the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); (6) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; (7) generating fewer productivity improvements than estimated; and (8) legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (the "Reports"). Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. A further description of these factors is located in the Reports under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A (Annual Report) and in Part II, Item 1A (Quarterly Report).

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share measures that exclude special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the company's operations. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2008.
 
(a)
                     
During the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $229 million. This charge primarily related to employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits, and fixed asset impairments. All business segments were impacted by these actions.
 
(b)
                    
During the fourth quarter of 2008, a pre-tax benefit of $10 million was recorded, which primarily related to adjustments to employee-related liabilities for second and third-quarter 2008 exit activities. During the second and third quarters of 2008, management approved and committed to undertake certain exit activities, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $68 million. These charges primarily related to employee-related liabilities and fixed asset impairments, with
 
 
 
actions taken in Industrial and Transportation, Display and Graphics, Health Care, Safety, Security and Protection Services, and Corporate.
 
(c)
                     
In June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software, a 3M company, to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the second quarter of 2008 (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). This pre-tax loss was reported on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 3M's tax basis in HighJump Software was significantly lower than its book value, primarily related to the treatment of acquired goodwill. This resulted in a gain for tax purposes, which increased the provision for income taxes by $9 million.
 
(d)
                    
In March 2008, 3M entered into a sale-leaseback transaction relative to an administrative location in Italy. 3M anticipates leasing back the facility through late 2009 at which time a new location will be utilized. The vast majority of the proceeds were received in September 2008, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately 29 million Euros ($41 million) in the third quarter of 2008. This gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2008.

(e)
                     
In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses. 3M received proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $68 million in the Display and Graphics segment in the second quarter of 2007. In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. 3M received proceeds of $817 million from this transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $786 million in the first quarter of 2007 and recorded an adjustment (pre-tax loss of $5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2007 (Health Care segment).
 
(f)
                       
Net pre-tax charges for total year 2007 that have been recorded to address remediation activities associated with perfluoronated compounds totaled $134 million. These expenses were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
No adverse human health effects are caused by perfluoronated compounds at current levels of exposure. This conclusion is supported by a large body of research including laboratory studies and epidemiology studies of exposed employees. This research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and shared with the EPA and global scientific-community.
 
(g)
                    
During the fourth quarter of 2006 and first six months of 2007, management approved and committed to undertake restructuring actions. Net pre-tax restructuring charges for total year 2007 were $41 million, which included a net pre-tax benefit of $4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. These 2007 charges primarily related to fixed asset impairments and employee-related restructuring liabilities, with the majority related to the phase-out of operations at a New Jersey roofing granule facility (Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). These charges are primarily recorded in cost of sales in the business segment where the expenses were incurred.
 
(h)
                    
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $19 million related to employee reductions and fixed asset impairments, with the majority recorded in the Display and Graphics segment and the Industrial and Transportation segment. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $26 million related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit capabilities. This third-quarter 2007 charge related to employee reductions and fixed asset impairments in the Electro and Communications business segment. Exit activities were recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
(i)
                        
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a net pre-tax gain of $52 million related to the sale of a Korean laboratory facility. The gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
Refer to 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 19, 2008, which updated 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 15, 2008, for further discussion of these previously disclosed 2007 items.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2007.
 
 
 
 
(j)        The changes in 3M's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans' funded status, which is required to be measured as of each year-end, significantly impacted several balance sheet lines. These required annual measurements decreased prepaid pension benefits' assets by $1.7 billion, increased deferred taxes within other assets by $1.1 billion, increased non-funded pension and postretirement benefits' long-term liabilities by $1.7 billion and decreased stockholders' equity by $2.3 billion. Other pension and postretirement changes during the year, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet captions. In addition, goodwill and intangible assets increased approximately $1.8 billion, which related to acquisition activity during 2008.
 
 
 
(k)
         
Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of performance and uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
 
"Net cash provided by operating activities" and "Free Cash Flow" were negatively impacted in 2007 by the timing of cash tax payments associated with special items. Tax payments related to the sale of our global branded pharmaceuticals business negatively impacted total year 2007 net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow by $628 million, with $87 million of this impact recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
(l)
            
The company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M's net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
(m) The Company uses non-GAAP measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3M uses Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), defined as annualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is defined as net assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt and minority interest liabilities. 3M's ROIC calculation was revised in 2008 to include interest income and to simplify/improve the means for determining operating capital. Prior period amounts have been updated to conform to the revised calculation. These measures are not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
