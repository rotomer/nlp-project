(a)           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Plan and its employees, trustees, fiduciaries, affiliates, agents and representatives (collectively the "") against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed, or any amendment thereto, or any preliminary Prospectus, or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or contained in any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405) prepared by the Company or authorized by it in
Indemnified Parties
 
 
writing for use by the Plan (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein (in the case of a Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon (A) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Plan expressly for use therein (it being understood that the statements set forth in the first and third paragraphs and the table under the heading "Selling Stockholder" and the second through tenth paragraphs under the heading "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus filed in connection with the initial contribution (or the corresponding paragraphs in any further amendment or supplement to the Prospectus), constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Plan expressly for inclusion in such Prospectus); (B) offers or sales effected by or on behalf such indemnified party "by means of" (as defined in Rule 159A) a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) that was not authorized in writing by the Company; or (C) use of the Registration Statement or the related Prospectus during a period when use of such Prospectus has been suspended pursuant to Section 2(c) or Section 4(q) hereof, , in each case, that the Plan received prior notice of such suspension.

(b)           Promptly after receipt by the Indemnified Parties under Section 6(a) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the Indemnified Parties shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under such Section, notify the Company in writing thereof. The omission so to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Parties hereunder, except to the extent the Company is materially prejudiced as a result of such omission, and in no event shall relieve it from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Parties otherwise. In case any such action shall be brought against any of the Indemnified Parties and it shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Parties promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from the Indemnified Parties, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Parties and the Company, and the Indemnified Parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to one or more of them which are different from or additional to those available to the Company, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select separate counsel and any local counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Parties. Upon receipt of notice from the Company to the Indemnified Parties of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the Indemnified Parties of counsel, the Company will not be liable to the Indemnified Parties under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation conducted at the request of such the Company) unless (i) the Indemnified Parties shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence and any local counsel, (ii) the Company shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified
 
Parties to represent the Indemnified Parties within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the Company has authorized the employment of counsel for the Indemnified Parties at the expense of the Company; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
 
(c)          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to hold harmless the
Indemnified Parties
under Section 6(a) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Indemnified Parties
as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the
Indemnified Parties
, on the other, from the offering of the Registrable Securities and also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the
Indemnified Parties
, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the Plan failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c) above, including the consequences of such failure, and whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Plan, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(d)           The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to Section 6(c) were determined by per-capita allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(c). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in Section 6(c) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Indemnified Parties within the meaning of the Securities Act.
