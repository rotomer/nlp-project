About 3M

With $25 billion in sales, 3M employs 75,000 people worldwide and has operations in more than 60 countries.
 
 
(a)
         
3M adopted a new accounting standard relating to the reporting of noncontrolling interest in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries effective January 1, 2009.  The new standard, among other things, changed the presentation format and certain captions of the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet. 3M uses the captions recommended by this standard in its consolidated financial statements such as "net income attributable to 3M" and "earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholdersdiluted." However, 3M has herein shortened this language to "net income" and "earnings per share" (or a slight variation thereof), respectively.
 
Special items described below are included in operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share and impacted results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2009. Special items that impacted the three months ended September 30, 2009 results (item b) reduced operating income by $26 million, reduced net income by $14 million, and reduced earnings by $0.02 per diluted share. Special items that impacted the nine months ended September 30, 2009 results (items b-c) reduced operating income by $194 million, reduced net income by $119 million, and reduced earnings by $0.17 per diluted share.
 
(b)           During the first three quarters of 2009, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions, which resulted in a net pre-tax charge for the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2009, of $26 million and $209 million, respectively. This charge related to employee-related liabilities for severance/benefits and other for the three-months ended September 30, 2009. Employee-related liabilities for severance/benefits and other of approximately $190 million and fixed asset impairments of approximately $19 million were recorded for the nine-months ended September 30, 2009, with all business segments impacted by these actions. For the three-months ended September 30, 2009, these charges were recorded in cost of sales and research, development and related expenses, with these expenses totaling $25 million and $1 million, respectively. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2009, these charges were recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research, development and related expenses, with these expenses totaling $110 million, $91 million and $8 million, respectively.
 
(c)
                 
In June 2009, 3M completed the sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility and recorded a pre-tax gain of $15 million. This gain was recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment.
 
As discussed in more detail later in the section entitled "Business Segments," 3M made certain changes to its business segments in the first quarter of 2009. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these changes.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2009, net restructuring charges in aggregate of $26 million reduced operating income by business segment as follows: Industrial and Transportation ($21 million), Corporate and Unallocated ($5 million), Health Care ($1 million), and Electro and Communications ($1 million). Display and Graphics had a net credit of $2 million. For the first nine months of 2009, net restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, in aggregate reduced operating income by $194 million, with the following impacts by segment: Industrial and Transportation ($88 million), Corporate and Unallocated ($38 million), Display and Graphics ($22 million), Health Care ($20 million), Consumer and Office ($13 million), Electro and Communications ($11 million) and Safety, Security and Protection Services ($2 million).
 
The following special items (d) through (f) impacted results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2008. Special items that impacted three months ended September 30, 2008 results (items e and f) reduced operating income and net income by $8 million, and reduced earnings by $0.01 per diluted share. Special items that impacted nine months ended September 30, 2008 results (items d-f) reduced operating income by $50 million, reduced net income by $54 million, and reduced earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.
 
(d)
                
In June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software, a 3M company, to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the second quarter of 2008 (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment). This pre-tax loss was reported on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 3M's tax basis in HighJump Software was significantly lower than its book value, primarily related to the treatment of acquired goodwill. This resulted in a gain for tax purposes, which increased the provision for income taxes by $9 million.
 
(e)
                 
During the third quarter of 2008, management approved and committed to undertake certain exit activities, which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $49 million. This charge primarily related to employee-related liabilities and fixed asset impairments, with actions taken in Display and Graphics, Industrial and Transportation, Health Care, Safety, Security and Protection Services, and Corporate. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $19 million related to exit activities. These charges related to employee reductions at an Industrial and Transportation manufacturing facility located in the United Kingdom.
 
(f)
                   
In March 2008, 3M entered into a sale-leaseback transaction relative to an administrative location in Italy. 3M anticipates leasing back the facility through late 2009 at which time a new location will be utilized. The vast majority of the proceeds were received in September 2008, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately 29 million Euros ($41 million) in the third quarter of 2008. This gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in Corporate and Unallocated.
 
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2008, charges which reduced operating income by business segment were as follows:  Industrial and Transportation ($11 million), Health Care ($10 million), Display and Graphics ($20 million), Safety, Security and Protection Services ($3 million) and Corporate and Unallocated ($5 million). Corporate and Unallocated also includes a $41 million gain (item f) for the three-months ended September 30, 2008. In addition to the preceding first three months 2008 items, first nine months 2008 also includes charges which reduced operating income by business segments as follows: Industrial and Transportation ($19 million) and Safety, Security and Protection Services ($23 million).
 
 
 
(g)
        
Certain amounts in the prior years' Consolidated Balance Sheet have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. As discussed in Note 1 in 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 13, 2009 (which updated 3M's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K), 3M adopted accounting standards related to noncontrolling interest and convertible debt instruments, effective January 1, 2009. Both standards required retrospective application. In addition, 3M reclassified balance sheet amounts related to life insurance policies from investments to other assets and also reclassified current and non-current balance sheet amounts related to income taxes between deferred income taxes and accrued income taxes.
 
(h)
        
When comparing September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, to September 30, 2008, balance sheet amounts, the changes in 3M's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans' funded status, which is required to be measured as of each year-end, significantly impacted several balance sheet lines. This required annual measurement at December 31, 2008, decreased prepaid pension benefits' assets by $1.7 billion, increased deferred taxes within other assets by $1.1 billion, increased non-funded pension and postretirement benefits' long-term liabilities by $1.7 billion and decreased equity by $2.3 billion. Other pension and postretirement changes, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet captions. 3M made a non-cash U.S. pension contribution of approximately $600 million in shares of its common stock during the three-months ended September 30, 2009.
