FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.
 Jan. 28, 2010 - 3M (NYSE: MMM) today reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.30 per share on sales of $6.1 billion, with operating income margins of 21.9 percent (a). Sales and per-share earnings increased 11.1 percent and 69 percent year-on-year, respectively. Excluding special items (b-g) in the fourth quarter of 2008, fourth-quarter 2009 per-share earnings rose 34 percent. Profits grew at double-digit rates in each of the company's six business segments and in all geographic regions. Free cash flow (i) for the fourth quarter grew by 16 percent to $770 million.
 
The company posted full-year 2009 sales of $23.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.52, down 8.5 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. Excluding special items (b-g), 2009 earnings declined 9.3 percent to $4.69 per share.
 
"By any measure, 2009 was a highly successful year for 3M and I could not be more proud of the 3M team for their undaunted effort in a challenging year," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We delivered tremendous results while continuing to invest significantly in our future with R&D investments of $1.3 billion and capital investments topping $900 million. And we posted a 21.7 percent operating margin for the year, equal to 2008 levels, which is a tremendous achievement in the midst of the worst recession since early last century."
 
Buckley continued, "Importantly, our company got stronger and our results improved as the year went on, culminating with an outstanding fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter rose over 11 percent to $6.1 billion as all six business segments and all geographic regions expanded their sales year-on-year. These sales helped drive a 38 percent increase in operating profit, with all segments and geographies posting double-digit growth. Our strong fourth quarter gives me great confidence for continued success in 2010 and beyond."
 
3M increased its 2010 GAAP per-share earnings expectations to a range of $4.90 to $5.10 versus a prior expected range of $4.85 to $5.00. The company expects organic sales volumes to grow 5 to 7 percent and currency effects to add 1 to 2 percent to sales for the year.
 
Fourth-Quarter Key Financial Highlights
Fourth-quarter worldwide sales totaled $6.1 billion, up 11.1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Local-currency sales including acquisitions increased 6.4 percent and foreign exchange added 4.8 percent to sales growth in the quarter.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (1) worldwide economic and capital markets conditions; (2) the Company's credit ratings and its cost of capital; (3) competitive conditions and customer preferences; (4) foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; (5) the timing and acceptance of new product offerings; (6) the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to
 
shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); (7) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; (8) generating fewer productivity improvements than estimated; and (9) legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (the "Reports").

About 3M
 
A recognized leader in research and development, 3M produces thousands of innovative products for dozens of diverse markets. 3M's core strength is applying its more than 40 distinct technology platforms  often in combination  to a wide array of customer needs. With $23 billion in sales, 3M employs 75,000 people worldwide and has operations in more than 65 countries.
(a)
         
3M adopted a new accounting standard relating to the reporting of noncontrolling interest in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries effective January 1, 2009.  The new standard, among other things, changed the presentation format and certain captions of the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet. 3M uses the captions recommended by this standard in its consolidated financial statements such as "net income attributable to 3M" and "earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders  diluted." However, in the preceding release 3M has shortened this language to "net income" and "earnings per share" (or a slight variation thereof), respectively.
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income, net income attributable to 3M (hereafter referred to as "net income"), and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders (hereafter referred to as "diluted earnings per share") are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding special items). Special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the company's operations. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2009.
(b)
      
During the first three quarters of 2009, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions, which resulted in a net pre-tax charge for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2009 of $209 million. These charges included employee-related liabilities for severance/benefits and other of approximately $190 million and fixed asset impairments of approximately $19 million, with all business segments impacted by these actions. These charges were recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research, development and related expenses, with these expenses totaling $110 million, $91 million and $8 million, respectively.
 
(c)
       
In June 2009, 3M completed the sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility and recorded a pre-tax gain of $15 million. This gain was recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2009. As discussed in more detail later in the section entitled "Business Segments," 3M made certain changes to its business segments in the first quarter of 2009. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these changes.

(i)
          
Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of performance and uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
 
(j)
          
The company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M's net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
