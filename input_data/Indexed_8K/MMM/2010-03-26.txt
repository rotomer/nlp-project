Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On March 26, 2010, 3M Company issued a press release describing the one-time charge the Company expects to take in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by the President on March 23, 2010, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 passed by Congress. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Under an existing Federal program, many companies including 3M receive a tax-advantaged subsidy to encourage them to provide retiree prescription drug coverage.  The tax advantage of the subsidy has been eliminated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) including modifications included in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the "Act') passed by Congress on March 25, 2010. Although the elimination of this tax advantage does not take effect until 2013 under the Act, 3M is required to recognize the full accounting impact in its financial statements in the period in which the Act is signed. Because future anticipated retiree health care liabilities and related tax subsidies are already reflected in 3M's financial statements, the change in law will result in a reduction of the value of the company's deferred tax asset related to the subsidy. This reduction in value will create a one-time non-cash charge to 3M's earnings in the first quarter of 2010 of approximately $85 to $90 million after tax (approximately 12 cents per share). 3M's 2010 GAAP per-share earnings expectations, as provided in 3M's Form 8-K dated January 28, 2010, were based on tax law in effect as of that date and therefore did not include the impact of the Act. In its first-quarter 2010 earnings release, 3M will provide both 2010 GAAP earnings and earnings excluding this one-time special item.

Exhibit 99
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.
 Mar. 26, 2010  3M Company (NYSE: MMM) said today that it expects to record a one-time non-cash charge of $85 to $90 million after tax, or approximately 12 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2010, resulting from the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 passed by Congress on March 25, 2010.  The charge is due to a reduction in the value of the company's deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements. The company's 2010 GAAP earnings expectations, as provided in 3M's Form 8-K dated January 28, 2010, were based on tax law in effect as of that date and therefore did not include the impact of the Act.
