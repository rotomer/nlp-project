Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
As described in this Current Report, during the first quarter of 2010, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments. This Current Report includes supplemental unaudited historical business segment sales and operating income information to reflect these business segment realignments on both an annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (furnished hereunder as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference). The Company did not operate under the realigned business segment structure for any of these prior periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act.

EXHIBIT 99
 
As more fully described below, this Current Report on Form 8-K includes supplemental unaudited reclassified business segment net sales and operating income information (provided on an annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007). This supplemental unaudited information is being provided to show reclassified historical results due to product moves between business segments. The Company did not operate under the realigned business segment structure for any of these prior periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure effective with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
Effective in the first quarter of 2010, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. There were no changes to business segments related to product moves for the Health Care segment, Consumer and Office segment, Display and Graphics segment, or Electro and Communications segment. In addition, 3M results in total did not change. The product moves between business segments are summarized as follows:
 
                      
Certain acoustic systems products in the Occupational Health and Environmental Safety Division (part of the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment) were transferred to the Automotive Division within the Industrial and Transportation business segment. In addition, thermal acoustics systems products which were included in the Occupational Health and Environmental Safety Division as a result of 3M's April 2008 acquisition of Aearo Holding Corp. were transferred to the Aerospace and Aircraft Maintenance Department within the Industrial and Transportation business segment. These product moves establish an acoustic center of excellence within the Industrial and Transportation business segment. The preceding product moves resulted in an increase in net sales for total year 2009 of $116 million for Industrial and Transportation, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in net sales for Safety, Security and Protection Services.
 
The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment structure changes for all products presented. The impact of the preceding changes on previously reported 2009 business segment net sales and operating income is summarized as follows:
 
 
3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in products, technologies and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2010, 3M continues to manage its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation segment; Health Care segment; Consumer and Office segment; Display and Graphics segment; Safety, Security and Protection Services segment; and the Electro and Communications segment. 3M's six business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. These segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually all 3M product lines. 3M is not dependent on any single product or market. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the financial information shown.

Operating Income
 
Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure of items that significantly impacted 2009, 2008 and 2007 business segment reported operating income. The most significant items impacting 2009, 2008 and 2007 operating income are restructuring and other actions and the gain or loss on sale of businesses, primarily the gain on sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe (within the Health Care segment) in 2007. Operating income presented in the table that follows includes the impact of these significant items.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating income principally includes corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring program charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Operating Income
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income measures that exclude special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the Company's operations. The Company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
As discussed in 3M's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2009 results included net losses for special items that reduced operating income by $194 million. 2009 included restructuring actions ($209 million), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($15 million). These net losses were recorded in the first quarter of 2009 ($67 million), second quarter of 2009 ($101 million) and third quarter of 2009 ($26 million).
 
As also discussed in 3M's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2008 results included net losses for special items that reduced operating income by $269 million. 2008 included restructuring actions ($229 million), exit activities ($58 million) and losses related to the sale of businesses ($23 million), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($41 million). These net losses were recorded in the second quarter of 2008 ($42 million), third quarter of 2008 ($8 million) and fourth quarter of 2008 ($219 million).
 
As also discussed in 3M's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2007 results included net gains for special items that increased operating income by $681 million. 2007 included gains related to the sale of businesses ($849 million) and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million), which were partially offset by increases in environmental liabilities ($134 million), restructuring actions ($41 million), and exit activities ($45 million). Net gains of $653 million were recorded for the first quarter of 2007, in addition to net gains of $22 million in the second quarter of 2007, net gains of $26 million in the third quarter of 2007, and net losses of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
The reconciliation provided below, which has been revised from what was previously reported to reflect the segment realignment effective in the first quarter of 2010, reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The business segment changes occurred between the Industrial and Transportation segment and the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment.  There were no changes in total worldwide consolidated operating income compared to what was previously reported.
