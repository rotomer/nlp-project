FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.
 Jan. 25, 2011  3M (NYSE: MMM) today reported fourth-quarter sales of $6.7 billion, up 9.6 percent year-on-year including an 8.6 percent increase in organic volumes. Net income was $928 million, or $1.28 per share, versus $935 million, or $1.30 per share in the corresponding period last year.
 
Quarterly organic sales volumes increased in all six of 3M's businesses, led by a 19.8 percent increase in the Electro and Communications business and a 14.7 percent increase in Display and Graphics. On a geographic basis, organic volume growth was strongest in Asia Pacific at 18.1 percent and Latin America at 12.2 percent.
 
The company posted full-year 2010 sales of $26.7 billion and earnings per share of $5.63, up 15.3 percent and 24.6 percent, respectively. Excluding special items (a-c), 2010 earnings increased 22.6 percent to $5.75 per share. All businesses posted positive organic volume growth, led by Electro and Communications at 26.9 percent, Display and Graphics at 26.5 percent and Industrial & Transportation at 16.9 percent.
 
"3M made great progress in 2010 as we achieved record sales and earnings per share for the year, and made significant investments to improve long-term growth," said George W. Buckley, 3M chairman, president and chief executive officer. "For example, our research and development investments of $1.4 billion fueled innovation and drove new product sales as a percent of total to 31 percent. We also accelerated sales and marketing investments in high-growth markets to help secure future growth. Overall, I could not be more proud of the 3M team for their effort in 2010."
 
The company also noted good sales momentum entering 2011. Fourth-quarter sales grew nearly 10 percent to a record $6.7 billion, despite negative comparisons from H1N1 and moderating sales growth in optical films for LCD TVs. Sales growth was broad-based, with organic volumes expanding in all businesses and geographies during the quarter.
 
3M increased its 2011 earnings expectation to a range of $5.95 to $6.20 per share versus a prior expectation of $5.90 to $6.10. Included in this estimated range is a $0.22 per share year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement benefit expense.Excluding the pension and postretirement expense increase, 2011 earnings would be in the range of $6.17 to $6.42 per share, an increase of 10 to 14 percent year over year. The company also expects double-digit sales growth in 2011, with organic sales volume growing 5.5 to 7.5 percent, currency effects adding 1 to 2 percent and acquisitions adding 4 to 6 percent to sales for the year.

You can identify these statements by the use of words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "will," "target," "forecast" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (1) worldwide economic and capital markets conditions; (2) competitive conditions and customer preferences; (3) foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; (4) the timing and acceptance of new product offerings; (5) the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); (6) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; (7) generating fewer productivity improvements than estimated; and (8) legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (the "Reports"). Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. A further description of these factors is located in the Reports under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A (Annual Report) and in Part II, Item 1A (Quarterly Report).

About 3M
 
3M captures the spark of new ideas and transforms them into thousands of ingenious products. Our culture of creative collaboration inspires a never-ending stream of powerful technologies that make life better. 3M is the innovation company that never stops inventing.
 
With $27 billion in sales, 3M employs 80,000 people worldwide and has operations in more than 65 countries.
 
 
 
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items. Operating income, net income attributable to 3M (hereafter referred to as "net income"), and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders (hereafter referred to as "diluted earnings per share") are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding special items). Special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the company's ongoing operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the company's operations. The company believes that discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2010.
 
 
(a)
         
The twelve-months ended December 31, 2010 includes a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Act").  The charge is due to a reduction in the value of the Company's deferred tax asset as a result of the Act's change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements.
 
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2009.
 
 
(b)
        
During the first three quarters of 2009, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions, which resulted in a pre-tax charge for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2009 of $209 million. This charge was comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance/benefits and other of approximately $190 million and fixed asset impairments of approximately $19 million. All business segments were impacted by these actions. For the twelve-months ended December 31, 2009, these charges were recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research, development and related expenses, with these expenses totaling $110 million, $91 million and $8 million, respectively.
 
(c)
         
In June 2009, 3M completed the sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility and recorded a pre-tax gain of $15 million. This gain was recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment.
The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP operating income measure by business segment with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2009.  There were no special items that impacted operating income for the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2010.  As discussed in more detail later in the section entitled "Business Segments," 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in the first quarter of 2010. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these changes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d)
    
Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of performance and uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
 
 
(e)
    
The company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M's net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effective in the first quarter of 2010, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect this new segment structure.  Refer to 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 17, 2010, which updated 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 16, 2010, for discussion of these product moves.
 
 
For the three-months and twelve-months ended December 31, 2009, refer to the preceding notes (b-c) and the preceding reconciliation of operating income by business segment for a discussion and summary of items that impacted reported business segment operating income.
