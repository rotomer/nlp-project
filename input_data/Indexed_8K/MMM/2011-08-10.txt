Item 1.01
Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement
 
On August 5, 2011, 3M Company entered into a $1.5 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citicorp Global Markets Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A. as syndication agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders as defined in the Credit Agreement.
 
Under the Credit Agreement, 3M pays a facility fee that varies between 0.050% and 0.100%, depending on our credit rating. Revolving advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry, at 3M's option, either the "base rate" of interest in effect plus the applicable margin, or the "eurocurrency rate" which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin.  Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the "eurocurrency rate." The "base rate" of interest is the highest of (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%.  The applicable margin includes a market rate spread which is a rate per annum equal to the credit default swap mid-rate spread of 3M for the applicable tenor.  This spread varies between 0.200% and 0.875% depending on our credit rating.  The applicable margin for "eurocurrency rate" advances is the market rate spread.  The applicable margin for "base rate" advances is the market rate spread minus 1.00% (but not less than 0%).
 
The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of the total facility up to $2 billion, with the grant of such request at the lenders' discretion.  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity. Further, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain our EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to interest payable on all funded debt for the same period.
 
The full terms and conditions of the credit facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.  The Credit Agreement replaces the $1.5 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement dated as of April 30, 2007 among 3M, the lenders named therein and Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent.
 
Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with 3M and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, foreign exchange and trust services.

Revolving Advances.
 
Each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances (each, a "Revolving Advance") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Commitment Termination Date applicable to such Bank in accordance with this Section 2.1; , , that no Bank shall have any obligation to make any Revolving Advance if, after giving effect to such Advance, (i) that Bank's Committed Outstandings (based in respect of any Revolving Advances to be denominated in a Committed Currency by reference to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars determined on the date of delivery of the applicable request for such Revolving Borrowing) would exceed that Bank's Commitment, or (ii) the Aggregate Outstandings (based in respect of any Revolving Credit Advances to be denominated in a Committed Currency by reference to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars determined on the date of delivery of the applicable request for such Revolving Borrowing) would exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount.

Swingline Advances.
 
In order to accommodate the Borrower's need for short-term revolving credit, the Swingline Bank agrees to make advances on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section (each a "Swingline Advance").
 
(a)
                                 
Swingline Advances shall be available during the period from the date of this Agreement through and including the Commitment Termination Date applicable to the Swingline Bank.  Each Swingline Advance shall be denominated in Dollars.
 
(b)
                                
The Swingline Bank shall have no obligation to make any Swingline Advance if, after giving effect to such Swingline Advance, (i) the aggregate amount of Swingline Advances then outstanding would exceed the Swingline Commitment Amount, (ii) the Aggregate Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount, or (iii) the Aggregate Outstandings would exceed the commitments of the Banks having a Commitment Termination Date that is less than ten Business Days after the date of such Swingline Advance.
 
(c)
                                 
Each Swingline Advance shall occur following written or telephonic request to the Swingline Bank from any person purporting to be authorized to request Advances on behalf of the Borrower.  Each such notice or request must be received by the Swingline Bank no later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day on which the Swingline Advance is to occur and shall specify (i) that the Borrower is requesting a Swingline Advance, and (ii) the amount thereof.  Prior to the close of business on the day it receives the notice or request, the Swingline Bank shall disburse the Swingline Advance by crediting the same to the Borrower's demand deposit account maintained with the Agent or in such other manner as the
Swingline Bank and the Borrower may from time to time agree in writing.  The Swingline Bank shall have no obligation to, and shall not, disburse any Swingline Advance if any condition set forth in Section 2.5 has not been satisfied on the day of the requested Swingline Advance.  Each Swingline Advance shall be in the amount of $10,000,000 or more.
 
(d)
                                
Each Swingline Advance shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the Floating Rate.  Interest on the Swingline Advance shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on the final Commitment Termination Date.

(f)
                                   
The Borrower shall repay the principal of the Swingline Advances in full not less frequently than once every ten Business Days, and upon such repayment in full, shall not request another Swingline Advance for at least one full Business Day.  The Borrower may use the proceeds of an Advance made pursuant to Section 2.1 to repay any Swingline Advance.
 
(g)
                                
The Swingline Bank may at any time and from time to time (whether before or after the occurrence of an Event of Default), by notice to the Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on any Business Day, request that the Banks make Revolving Advances in an aggregate principal amount equal to the then-outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Advances.  Upon receiving such notice and request, and in any event not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of the notice and request, the Agent shall notify each Bank of the amount of the requested Borrowing, that the proceeds of the Borrowing are to be used to repay a Swingline Advance and of the amount of each Bank's Advance with respect thereto.  Unless one of the events described in Section 10.1(j) shall have occurred, so long as a Bank receives such notice from the Agent prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date the requested Borrowing is to occur, each Bank shall make its Advance with respect to that Borrowing available to the Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Agent not later than 3:00 p.m. on the same day.  Prior to the close of business on the same day, the Agent will disburse the Borrowing by crediting the same to the account of the Swingline Bank.  Any Advances made by Banks pursuant to this Section 2.2(g) shall initially bear interest at the Base Rate, but the rate of interest that applies to such Advances may be converted pursuant to Section 5.2, and such Advances shall in all other respects be treated in the same manner as Advances made pursuant to Section 2.1.
 
(h)
                                
The Borrower may prepay any Swingline Advance on the Business Day it is made or on any subsequent Business Day; , , that each such partial prepayment shall be in the principal amount of $10,000,000 or more.

In the event that one of the events of default described in Section 10.1(j) shall have occurred, the Agent shall immediately notify the Swingline Bank and the Banks, and, if any Swingline Advances or interest thereon is outstanding on such
day it receives notice, each Bank will purchase from the Swingline Bank an undivided participation interest in the Swingline Advance and interest thereon in an amount equal to its Percentage of such Swingline Advance.  Upon request, each Bank will promptly transfer to the Swingline Bank, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Bank will deliver to such Bank a loan participation certificate, dated the date of receipt of such funds and in such amount.  Thereafter, the Swingline Bank shall make no further Swingline Advances, any payments received directly by the Swingline Bank with respect to the Swingline Advances shall be treated as excess payments subject to Section 11.4, and all other payments made by the Borrower shall be applied in the manner required by Section 11.2.

Each Bank's obligation to make a Revolving Advance under paragraph (g) or to purchase a participation in a Swingline Advance under paragraph (i) shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including but not limited to (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Bank or any other Person may have against the Swingline Bank, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default or the termination of the Commitments, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any other Person, (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the Borrower or any other Bank, or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to the foregoing.

Any Swingline Advances that are outstanding on the Commitment Termination Date shall be paid in full on such date, with all accrued interest.

Bid Borrowings.
 
(a)
                                 
The Borrower may from time to time deliver to the Agent a request (a "Bid Borrowing Request") that the Agent solicit offers to make Bid Loans denominated in Dollars from the Banks.  Each such request shall be made no later than 10:00 a.m. on the fourth Business Day before the day of the proposed Bid Borrowing.  Each such request shall state (i) the day of the proposed Bid Borrowing (which day shall be a Business Day), (ii) the aggregate amount of the proposed Bid Borrowing, and (iii) the Interest Period or Interest Periods with respect to such Bid Borrowing (and, if more than one Interest Period is to be applicable, the duration of each such Interest Period and the portion of the Bid Borrowing that will be subject to each such Interest Period).  Each Bid Borrowing request shall be in an amount equal to an integral multiple of $10,000,000.  The Borrower may not request any Bid Borrowing hereunder if (i) the Borrower has made such a request within the preceding 5 Business Days, (ii) the making of the proposed Bid Borrowing would cause more than 3 Bid Borrowings to be outstanding at any one time, (iii) the making of the proposed Bid Borrowing would cause the aggregate principal amount of Bid Borrowings to exceed $100,000,000, or (iv) the making of the proposed Bid Borrowing would cause the Aggregate Outstandings to exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount.
(b)
                                
Promptly following receipt of any Bid Borrowing Request, the Agent shall notify each Bank of the details thereof by telecopy.
 
(c)
                                 
Each Bank may (but shall have no obligation to) deliver to the Agent a Bid Loan Quote with respect to any Bid Borrowing Request.  The Agent may reject any Bid Loan Quote received after 9:00 a.m. on the third Business Day preceding the proposed Bid Borrowing; provided, however, that no Bid Loan Quote by JPMCB, in its capacity as a Bank, shall be effective if delivered to the Agent after 8:45 a.m. on the third Business Day preceding the proposed Bid Borrowing.  Each Bid Loan Quote shall specify the name of the offering Bank, the date of the proposed Bid Loan, the principal amount of the Bid Loan that the offering Bank proposes to make, and the rate of interest per annum (adjusted to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) to be applicable to the proposed Bid Loan.  The Agent shall ignore any Bid Loan Quote that (i) fails to include all of the information required under this paragraph, (ii) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language; (iii) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Bid Borrowing Request, or (iv) arrives after the time required above.
 
(d)
                                
The Agent shall notify the Borrower of the terms of any Bid Loan Quote submitted by a Bank that meets the requirements set forth above.  Such notice shall include (i) the aggregate principal amount of Bid Loans for which Bid Loan Quotes have been received for each Interest Period specified in the Bid Borrowing Request, (ii) the respective principal amounts and interest rates so offered, and (iii) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Bid Loans for which offers in any single Bid Loan Quote may be accepted.  Such notification shall be delivered (x) on the day of receipt, if the Bid Loan Quote is submitted prior to the third Business Day preceding the proposed Bid Borrowing, or (y) no later than 9:30 a.m. on the day of receipt, if the Bid Loan Quote is submitted on the third Business Day preceding the proposed Bid Borrowing.
 
(e)
                                 
Not later than 10:00 a.m. on the third Business Day preceding any Bid Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Agent in writing or telephonically of its acceptance or rejection of the Bid Loan Quotes.  If the Borrower fails to notify the Agent by such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have rejected each of the Bid Loan Quotes.  The Borrower's acceptance of any Bid Loan Quotes shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that the Borrower accepts.  The Borrower may accept any Bid Loan Quote in whole or in part, provided, however, that:
 
(i)
                                    
the principal amount of any portion of a Bid Borrowing subject to any given Interest Period may not exceed the corresponding portion specified in the related Bid Borrowing Request;
 
(ii)
                                 
the principal amount of each Bid Borrowing (as to all Interest Periods combined) must be equal to an integral multiple of $10,000,000;
(iii)
                              
acceptance of Bid Loan Quotes may only be made on the basis of ascending interest rates within each Interest Period; and
 
(iv)
                             
the Borrower may not accept any Bid Loan Quote that fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement.
 
(f)
                                   
If Bid Loan Quotes with the same interest rates with respect to any given Interest Period are submitted by two or more Banks in an aggregate amount greater than that necessary to satisfy the corresponding Bid Borrowing Request, the principal amount of Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in such amounts not less than $1,000,000 as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Absent manifest error, the determination by the Agent of the amount of the Bid Loans accepted with respect to each Bank shall be final.
 
(g)
                                
The Agent shall promptly notify each Bank having submitted a Bid Loan Quote if its offer has been accepted and, if so, of the amount of the Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be made by it on the date of the applicable Bid Borrowing.  Each Bank so notified that its Bid Loan Quote has been accepted shall remit the amount of its accepted Bid Loan Quote to the Agent in immediately available funds no later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of such Bid Borrowing.  Prior to the close of business on the day of the requested Bid Borrowing, the Agent shall disburse such funds by crediting the same to the Borrower's demand deposit account maintained with the Agent or in such other manner as the Agent and the Borrower may from time to time agree.  The Agent shall have no obligation (i) to disburse the requested Bid Borrowing if any condition set forth in Section 2.5 has not been satisfied on the day of the requested Bid Borrowing, or (ii) to disburse any portion of a Bid Borrowing for which the Agent has failed to receive funds from the applicable Bank by the time specified above.
 
(h)
                                
The Borrower's obligation to repay each Bid Loan shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the Bank making such Bid Loan in the ordinary course of business.
 
(i)
                                    
The Borrower and the Banks shall from time submit to the Agent such information as the Agent may reasonably request regarding outstanding Bid Loans, including the amounts, interest rates, dates of Borrowing and maturities thereof, for the purpose of allocating amounts received from the Borrower with respect thereto.
 
(j)
                                    
Nothing hereunder shall obligate any Bank, or the Banks collectively, to submit any Bid Loan Quotes in response to a Bid Borrowing Request, nor shall any provision hereunder obligate the Borrower to accept any one or more Bid Loan Quotes.

The obligation of each Bank to make any Advance hereunder shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent (and any request for an Advance shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Borrower that each of the following conditions precedent have been satisfied):
 
(a)
                                 
the Borrower has delivered to the Agent and the Banks each of the items required to be delivered pursuant to Section 7;

Increase of Commitments.
 
(a)
                                 
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may from time to time, upon at least 10 days' written notice to the Agent (who shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each Bank), propose to increase the Aggregate Commitment Amount by increments of $25,000,000, to an amount not to exceed $2,000,000,000 (the amount of any such increase, the "Additional Commitment Amount").  Each Bank may, not more than 10 Business Days following receipt of such notice, elect by written notice to the Borrower and the Agent to increase its Commitment by a principal amount equal to its Percentage of the Additional Commitment Amount.  No Bank (or any successor thereto) shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment or its other obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any decision by a Bank to increase its Commitment shall be made in its sole discretion independently from any other Bank.
 
(b)
                                
If any Bank shall not elect to increase its Commitment pursuant to paragraph (a), the Borrower may designate another bank or other financial institution (which may be, but need not be, one or more of the existing Banks) which at the time agrees to, in the case of any such Person that is an existing Bank, increase its Commitment and in the case of any other such Person (each such Person, and each Person that shall accept an assignment as provided in Section 2.7 is an "Additional Bank"), become a party to this Agreement; , , that any new bank or financial institution must meet the criteria for an Eligible Assignee and must in all other respects be acceptable to the Agent and the Swingline Bank, which acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

The sum of the increases in the Commitments of the existing Banks pursuant to this paragraph (b) plus the Commitments of the Additional Banks shall not in the aggregate exceed the unsubscribed amount of the Additional Commitment Amount.
 
(c)
                                 
An increase in the aggregate amount of the Aggregate Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall become effective upon the receipt by the Agent of an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent signed by the Borrower, by each Additional Bank and by each other Bank whose Aggregate Commitment Amount is to be increased, setting forth the new Commitments of such Banks and setting forth the agreement of each Additional Bank to become a party to this Agreement and to be bound by all the terms and provisions hereof, and such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on the part of the Borrower with respect to the increase in the Commitments and such opinions of counsel for the Borrower with respect to the increase in the Aggregate Commitment Amount as the Agent may reasonably request.
 
(d)
                                
Upon the acceptance of any such agreement by the Agent, the Aggregate Commitment Amount shall automatically be increased by the amount of the Commitments added through such agreement.
 
(e)
                                 
Upon any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.6 that is not pro rata among all Banks, within five (5) Business Days, in the case of any Revolving Advances bearing interest at the Floating Rate, and at the end of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, in the case of any Revolving Advances bearing interest at a LIBO Rate, the Borrower shall prepay such Advances in their entirety and, to the extent the Borrower elect to do so and subject to the conditions specified in Section 2.5, the Borrower shall reborrow Revolving Advances from the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments after giving effect to such increase, until such time as all outstanding Revolving Advances are held by the Banks in such proportion.

Extension of Commitment Termination Date.
 
(a)
                                 
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may, upon at least 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to the first and/or second anniversary of the date hereof, by written notice to the Agent (who shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each Bank), propose to extend the Commitment Termination Date by one year.  Each Bank may, not more than 30 days nor less than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, elect by written notice to the Borrower and the Agent to extend its Commitment Termination Date by a period of one year.  The Agent will notify the Borrower, in writing of the Banks' decisions no later than 15 days prior to such anniversary date.  No Bank (or any successor thereto) shall have any obligation to extend its Commitment Termination Date, and any decision by a Bank to increase its Commitment Termination Date shall be made in its sole discretion independently from any
other Bank.  Any Bank that does not respond to a request to extend the Commitment Termination Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Bank.
 
(b)          If any Bank shall not elect to extend its Commitment Termination Date pursuant to paragraph (a) (each such Bank being a "Non-Consenting Bank"), the Borrower may designate another bank or other financial institution (which may be, but need not be, one or more of the existing Banks) which at the time agrees to accept an assignment of the Commitment of the Non-Consenting Bank in accordance with Section 11.11; , , that (i) any Additional Bank must meet the criteria for an Eligible Assignee and must in all other respects be acceptable to the Agent and the Swingline Bank, which acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (ii) the amount of the Commitment of any such Additional Bank as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Bank is less than $5,000,000, in which case such Additional Bank shall assume all of such lesser amount; (iii) any such Non-Consenting Bank shall have been paid (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Bank (B) any accrued but unpaid commitment fees owing to such Non-Consenting Bank as of the effective date of such assignment; (iv) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Bank, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Bank hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Bank; and (v) with respect to any such Additional Bank, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section 11.11 for such assignment shall have been paid.  To the extent that the Commitment Termination Date is not extended as to any Bank pursuant to this Section 2.7 and the Commitment of such Bank is not assumed in accordance with this subsection (b), the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Bank shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Commitment Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Bank or any other Person; that such Non-Consenting Bank's rights under Sections 4.3, 5.4, 6.5 and 12.10, and its obligations under Section 11.5, shall survive the Commitment Termination Date for such Bank as to matters occurring prior to such date.

The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Bank to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Revolving Note is required or appropriate in order for such Bank to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Revolving Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Bank, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Bank a Revolving Note payable to the order of such Bank in a principal amount up to the Commitment of such Bank.

INTEREST

.1
                             
Floating Rate.
 
The principal balance of the Revolving Advances shall bear interest at the Floating Rate unless the Borrower elects a LIBO Rate pursuant to Section 5.2, subject, however, to imposition of the default rate pursuant to Section 5.3.
 
5
.2
                              
LIBO Rate.
 
The Borrower may from time to time notify the Agent in writing or by telephone that a particular portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Advances shall bear interest at a LIBO Rate for a particular Interest Period.  The portion of the outstanding balance of the Revolving Advances to which a LIBO Rate is applied (i) must be in an amount not less than the Revolving Borrowing Minimum or a multiple thereof, and (ii) must not bear, or otherwise be scheduled to bear, interest at a LIBO Rate at any time during the applicable Interest Period.  Any LIBO Rate notification shall be irrevocable, must be made pro rata with respect to the Revolving Advances of each Bank, and must be received by the Agent before 11:00 a.m. on the day three Business Days before the Business Day which is the first day of the applicable Interest Period.  Commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period and continuing through the last day thereof, the portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Advances to which the notification related shall bear interest at the applicable LIBO Rate (and the remaining part of the principal balance of the Revolving Advances, if any, shall continue to bear interest at the rate or rates previously applicable to such amounts), subject, however, to imposition of the default rate pursuant to Section 5.3.  At the termination of such Interest Period, unless a new LIBO Rate notification is requested and accepted by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the portion
of the principal balance of (1) the Revolving Advances denominated in Dollars to which the LIBO Rate was applicable shall revert to the Floating Rate and (2) the Revolving Advances denominated in any Committed Currency shall be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars determined on such date and revert to the Floating Rate.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower's right to have a portion of the Revolving Advances bear interest at a LIBO Rate hereunder shall be suspended (i) at any time that there is a Default or an Event of Default under this Agreement, (ii) during any period in which any Bank, in its sole discretion, determines that deposits in amounts equal to the amount for which a LIBO Rate notification has been given and maturing at the end of the proposed Interest Period are not readily available to that Bank from major banks in the London interbank market, or (iii) during any period in which any Bank shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank to perform its obligations hereunder or to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Advances hereunder, in which case (A) for each Revolving Advance denominated in any Committed Currency, the Borrower shall either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) exchange such Advances into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and such Advances shall revert to the Floating Rate and (B) the obligation of the Bank to make LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.  Absent manifest error, the records of the Agent shall be conclusive evidence as to the amount of the Revolving Advances bearing interest at a LIBO Rate, the applicable LIBO Rate and the date on which the Interest Period applicable to such LIBO Rate expires.  LIBO Rate Advances may not be outstanding as more than six separate Interest Periods.

Default Rate.
 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and so long as such Event of Default continues without written waiver thereof by the Agent and the Required Banks, in the sole discretion of the Required Banks and without waiving any of their other rights and remedies, the outstanding principal balance of the Advances shall bear interest at an annual rate which shall be equal to two percent (2.00%) over the annual rate or rates that would otherwise be in effect with respect to such Advances had there been no occurrence of such Event of Default.

Fees on LIBO Rate Advances; Capital Adequacy; Funding Exceptions.
 
In addition to any interest payable on Advances made hereunder and any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, the Borrower agrees:
 
(a)
                                 
LIBO Rate Advances.
  If at any time any applicable law, rule or regulation or the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board):
 
(i)
                                    
shall subject any Bank to any tax, duty or other charges (including but not limited to any tax designed to discourage the purchase or acquisition of foreign securities or debt instruments by United States nationals) with respect to this Agreement, or shall materially change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank of the principal of or interest on any portion of
the principal balance of any Advances bearing interest at a LIBO Rate (except for the imposition of or changes in respect of the rate of tax on the overall net income of that Bank); or
 
(ii)
                                 
shall impose or deem applicable or increase any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by any Bank because of any portion of the principal balance of any Advances bearing interest at a LIBO Rate and the result of any of the foregoing would be to increase the cost to that Bank of making or maintaining any such portion or to reduce any sum received or receivable by that Bank with respect to such portion;
 
then, within 30 days after demand by that Bank the Borrower shall pay that Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate that Bank for such increased cost or reduction.  A certificate in reasonable detail of any Bank setting forth the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts shall, absent obvious error, be conclusive evidence of such amount or amounts.  The Agent shall endeavor to notify the Borrower of any change in applicable laws, rules, regulations, interpretations or administrative practices that may give rise to liability under this Section, but the Agent shall have no liability to the Borrower for failure to so notify the Borrower, and the failure to give such notification shall not be a defense to the Borrower's obligation to pay any amounts under this paragraph (a).
 
(b)
                                
Capital Adequacy
.  If any Bank determines at any time that its Return has been reduced as a result of any Capital Adequacy Rule Change, that Bank may require the Borrower to pay it the amount necessary to restore that Bank's Return to what it would have been had there been no Capital Adequacy Rule Change.  For purposes of this paragraph (b), the following definitions shall apply:
 
(i)
                                    
"Return", for any calendar quarter or shorter period, means the percentage determined by dividing (A) the sum of interest and ongoing fees earned by a Bank under this Agreement during such period by (B) the average capital that Bank is required to maintain during such period as a result of its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by that Bank based upon its total capital requirements and a reasonable attribution formula that takes account of the Capital Adequacy Rules then in effect. Return may be calculated for each calendar quarter and for the shorter period between the end of a calendar quarter and the date of termination in whole of this Agreement.
 
(ii)
                                 
"Capital Adequacy Rule" means any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy that applies to any Bank, or the interpretation thereof by any governmental or regulatory authority including, without limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar monetary or multinational authority.  Capital Adequacy Rules include rules requiring financial institutions to maintain total capital in amounts based upon
percentages of outstanding loans, binding loan commitments and letters of credit.
 
(iii)
                              
"Capital Adequacy Rule Change" means any change in any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this Agreement, but does not include any changes in applicable requirements that at the date hereof are scheduled to take place under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any increases in the capital that any Bank is required to maintain to the extent that the increases are required due to a regulatory authority's assessment of that Bank's financial condition.  For the avoidance of doubt, any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy (x) issued in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or (y) promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall be deemed to occur after the date of this Agreement, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
 
(iv)
                             
"Bank" includes (but is not limited to) the Agent, the Banks, as defined elsewhere in this Agreement, any assignee of any interest of any Bank hereunder, any participant in the loans made hereunder and any holding company of any of the foregoing.
 
The initial notice sent by a Bank shall be sent as promptly as practicable after that Bank learns that its Return has been reduced, shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore that Bank's Return for the quarter in which the notice is sent, shall state in reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in that Bank's Return and that Bank's calculation of the amount of such reduction, and shall include that Bank's representation that it has made similar demand on one or more other commercial borrowers with revolving or term loans in excess of $500,000.  Thereafter, that Bank may send a new notice during each calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore that Bank's Return for that quarter.  A Bank's calculation in any such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.
 
(c)
                                 
Funding Exceptions.
  The Borrower shall also compensate any Bank, upon written request by that Bank (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts), for all losses and imputed costs in respect of any interest or other consideration paid by that Bank to lenders of funds borrowed by it or deposited with it to maintain any portion of the principal balance of any Advances at a LIBO Rate which that Bank sustains (i) on account of any failure of the Borrower to borrow at a LIBO Rate on a date specified therefor in a notice provided by the Borrower to the Agent under Section 5.2 of this Agreement or (ii) due to any payment or prepayment (whether pursuant to Section 6.2, 6.3, 9.2(d) or 10.2) of any Advance bearing interest at a LIBO Rate on a date other than the last day of
the applicable Interest Period for such Advance.  A certificate as to any such loss or cost (including calculations, in reasonable detail, showing how the applicable Bank computed such loss or cost) shall be promptly submitted by that Bank to the Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof.  Such loss or cost may be computed as though the applicable Bank acquired deposits in the London interbank market to fund that portion of the principal balance whether or not such Bank actually did so.

Mitigation of Yield Protection.
 
Each Bank hereby agrees that, commencing as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 5.4 or 6.5 with respect to such Bank, such Bank will give notice thereof through the Agent to the Borrower.  The Borrower may at any time, by notice through the Agent to any Bank, request that such Bank change its lending office as to any Advance or type of Advance or that it specify a new lending office with respect to its Commitment and any Advance held by it or that it rebook any such Advance with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences of an occurrence such as described in the preceding sentence, and such Bank will use reasonable efforts to comply with such request unless, in the opinion of such Bank, such change or specification or rebooking is inadvisable or might have an adverse effect, economic or otherwise, upon it, including its reputation.  In addition, each Bank agrees that, except for changes or specifications or rebookings required by law or effected pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the result of any change or change of specification of lending office or rebooking would, but for this sentence, be to impose additional costs or requirements upon the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 or Section 6.5 (which would not be imposed absent such change or change of specification or rebooking) by reason of legal or regulatory requirements in effect at the time thereof and of which such Bank is aware at such time, then such costs or requirements shall not be imposed upon the Borrower but shall be borne by such Bank.  All expenses incurred by any Bank in changing a lending office or specifying another lending office of such Bank or rebooking any Advance in response to a request from the Borrower shall be paid by the Borrower.  Nothing in this Section 5.6 (including, without limitation, any failure by a Bank to give any notice contemplated in the first sentence hereof) shall limit, reduce or postpone any obligations of the Borrower under Section 5.4 or Section 6.5, including any obligations payable in respect of any period prior to the date of any change or specification of a new lending office or any rebooking of any Advance.

DISBURSEMENTS AND PAYMENTS
 
6
.1
                              
Requests for Borrowings.
 
Each Borrowing shall occur on written or telephonic request (confirmed immediately in writing) to the Agent (and in the case of a LIBO Rate Borrowing denominated in a Committed Currency, to the London Sub-Agent) from a person believed by the Agent to be an officer of or other authorized representative for the Borrower.  A request for a Borrowing must be received by the Agent (and in the case of a LIBO Rate Advance denominated in a Committed Currency, to the London Sub-Agent) (i) not later than 11:00 a.m. on the day that such Borrowing is to be made in the case of a Borrowing that is to bear interest initially at the Floating Rate or (ii) not later than 11:00 a.m. on the day three Business Days before the Business Day which is the first day of the
applicable Interest Period for such Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars that is to bear interest initially (in whole or in part) at a LIBO Rate, (y) 2:00 P.M. (London time) on the day three Business Days before the Business Day which is the first day of the applicable Interest Period for such Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing denominated in any Committed Currency.  Each Revolving Borrowing denominated in any Committed Currency shall bear interest at a LIBO Rate.  Each Borrowing must be in an amount not less than the Revolving Borrowing Minimum or a multiple thereof and shall consist of Revolving Advances in the same currency made on the same day by the Banks ratably according to their respective Commitments.  Each such notice of a Revolving Borrowing shall specify the requested (i) date of such Revolving Borrowing, (ii) whether the Advances comprising such Revolving Borrowing are to be LIBO Rate Advances, (iii) aggregate amount of such Revolving Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Revolving Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and currency for each such Revolving Advance.  Upon receipt of any such request, the Agent shall notify the Banks of the intended Borrowing no later than 12:00 noon on the date such request for such Borrowing is received by the Agent.  At or before 2:00 p.m. on the date the requested Borrowing is to be made, in the case of a Revolving Borrowing consisting of Revolving Advances denominated in Dollars, and before 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the date of such Revolving Borrowing, in the case of a Revolving Borrowing consisting of Revolving Advances denominated in any Committed Currency, each Bank shall remit its Percentage of the requested Borrowing to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in immediately available funds.  Prior to the close of business on the day the requested Borrowing is to be made, the Agent shall disburse such funds by crediting the same to the Borrower's demand deposit account maintained with the Agent or in such other manner as the Agent and any officer of the Borrower may agree in writing.  Any Borrowing that is to initially bear interest at a LIBO Rate shall also be subject to all conditions set forth in Section 5.2 hereof.
 
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this Section 6.1 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to such Revolving Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, (A) the Federal Funds Rate, in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Revolving Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

Payments.
 
(a)             The Borrower shall initiate all payments, except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency, of principal, interest, fees and other payments due under
Generally.
 
this Agreement (including but not limited to all payments due under Section 3) and all prepayments with respect to this Agreement to the Banks by means of payment made by the Borrower to the Agent in Dollars not later than 12:00 noon in same day funds for the account of the Banks.  The Borrower shall initiate each payment with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency, not later than 11:00 A.M. (at the Payment Office for such Committed Currency) on the day when due in such Committed Currency to the Agent, by deposit of such funds to the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds.  All such payments shall be made in immediately available funds.  Any payment due on a day on which the Agent is not open for substantially all of its business shall be due on the next day on which the Agent is so open.  Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fee or commission, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBO Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.  Absent obvious error, the records of the Agent will be conclusive evidence of the principal and accrued interest owing with respect to all Obligations.
 
(b)
                                
Revolving Advances: Interest Payments.
  Interest accruing on the Revolving Advances during any month at the Floating Rate shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December and at maturity.  Interest accruing on the Revolving Advances at the LIBO Rate shall be payable on the last day of the applicable Interest Period and at maturity and, if the applicable Interest Period has a duration of longer than three months, on the day during such Interest Period that is every three months after the first day of such Interest Period.
 
(c)
                                 
Revolving Advances: Principal Payment.
  The entire principal balance of the Revolving Advances owing to each Bank shall be due and payable in full on the Commitment Termination Date applicable to such Bank.
 
(d)
                                
Swingline Advances.
  Interest and principal on the Swingline Advances shall be due and payable as set forth in Section 2.2.
 
(e)
                                 
Bid Loans: Interest.
  Interest accruing on the principal balance of each Bid Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
(f)
                                   
Bid Loans: Principal.
  The principal balance of each Bid Loan shall be due and payable in full on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by the Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Revolving Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Banks in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.2, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange
such funds into Dollars or into a Committed Currency or from Dollars to a Committed Currency or from a Committed Currency to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.2; provided that the Borrower and each of the Banks hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by the Borrower or such Bank as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies effected pursuant to this Section 6.2 or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange, except for such loss, cost or expense due to the Agent's negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct; and provided further that the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank, and hold the Agent and each Bank harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Bank for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 6.2 except for such losses, costs or expenses due to the Agent's or Bank's negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Prepayments.
 
(a)  .  The Borrower may prepay the Revolving Advances or the Swingline Advances in whole at any time or from time to time in part, without penalty or premium, provided that (i) prepayment of any Bank's Advances must be accompanied by pro rata prepayment of each other Bank's Advances, (ii) any partial prepayment must be in an aggregate amount not less than $10,000,000, (iii) prepayment of any principal bearing interest at a Base Rate may be made only on one Business Day's notice to the Agent, and (iv) any prepayment of Advances, which at the time of such prepayment bear interest at a LIBO Rate, shall be (A) made only on three Business Days' notice to the Agent, (B) in a principal amount equal to that portion of the entire Borrowing to which any given LIBO Rate was applicable, and (C) accompanied by accrued interest on such prepayment through the date of prepayment and additional compensation calculated in accordance with Section 5.4(c) hereof. The Borrower may not prepay any Bid Loan without the consent of the holder thereof.
Optional
 
(b)  .  If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Borrower that, on any interest payment date, the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars then outstanding plus (ii) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Committed Currencies then outstanding exceeds 105% of the aggregate Commitments of the Banks on such date, the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, subject to the proviso to this sentence set forth below, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Commitments of the Banks on such date together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount of Advances prepaid; provided that if the aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Advances outstanding at the time of such required prepayment is less than the amount of such required prepayment, the portion of such required prepayment in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Advances then outstanding shall be deferred until the earliest to occur of the last day of the Interest Period of the outstanding LIBO Rate Advances in an amount equal to the excess of such required prepayment.  The Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 6.3(b) to the Borrower and the Banks, and
Mandatory
shall provide prompt notice to the Borrower of any such notice of required prepayment received by it from any Bank.

.4
                              
Termination or Reduction of the Commitments.
 
The Borrower may from time to time on at least ten calendar days' prior notice received by the Agent (which shall promptly advise each Bank thereof) terminate the Commitments of the Banks in whole or permanently reduce the Commitments of the Banks in part, provided that (i) the Commitments of the Banks may not be terminated in whole at any time that any Advance remains outstanding, (ii) each partial reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall be in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 or in a multiple of $10,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) each partial reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall be pro rata as to all of the Commitments of the Banks on the basis of the respective Percentages of the Banks, and (iv) no partial reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall reduce the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Banks to an amount less than the Aggregate Outstandings.

Taxes.
 
(a)
                                 
All payments made by the Borrower to the Agent or any Bank (herein any "Payee") under or in connection with this Agreement shall be made without any setoff or other counterclaim, and free and clear of and without deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or other authority, except to the extent that such deduction or withholding is compelled by law.  As used herein, the term "Taxes" shall include all income, excise and other taxes of whatever nature (other than taxes generally assessed on the overall net income of the Payee by the government or other authority of the country, state or political subdivision in which such Payee is incorporated or in which the office through which the Payee is acting is located) as well as all levies, imposts, duties, charges, or fees of whatever nature.  If the Borrower is compelled by law to make any such deductions or withholdings it will:
 
(i)
           
pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;
 
(ii)
          
except to the extent that such deduction or withholding results from a breach by any Payee of the representations contained in Section 6.5(b), pay such additional amounts (including, without limitation, any penalties, interest or expenses) as may be necessary in order that the net amount received by each Payee after such deductions or withholdings (including any required deduction or withholding on such additional amounts) shall equal the amount such Payee would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made; and
 
(iii)
         
promptly forward to the Agent (for delivery to such Payee) an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such authorities.
(b)
                                
If any Taxes otherwise payable by the Borrower pursuant to the foregoing paragraph are directly asserted against any Payee, such Payee may pay such Taxes and the Borrower promptly shall reimburse such Payee to the full extent otherwise required by such paragraph.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 6.5 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  Each Bank by its execution of this Agreement does hereby represent (and each additional Bank by its execution of any Assignment Certificate pursuant to Section 11.11 shall be deemed to represent) to each other Bank, the Agent and the Borrower that if such Bank or additional Bank is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, such Bank or additional Bank has furnished to the Agent and the Borrower either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, as applicable (wherein such Bank claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder).
 
(c)
                                 
If the Borrower makes an increased tax payment to a Bank under the foregoing clause (a)(ii) and that Bank determines in its absolute discretion that (a) a tax credit is attributable to that tax payment, and (b) that Bank has obtained, utilized and fully retained that tax credit on an affiliated group basis, then such Bank shall pay an amount to the Borrower which that Bank determines in its absolute discretion will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-tax position as it would have been in had the payment under clause (a)(ii) not been required to be made by the Borrower; provided, however, that (i) such Bank shall be the sole judge of the amount of such tax credit and the date on which it is received, (ii) no Bank shall be obliged to disclose information regarding its tax affairs or tax computations, (iii) nothing herein shall interfere with a Bank's right to manage its tax affairs in whatever manner it sees fit, and (iv) if such Bank shall subsequently determine that it has lost the credit of all or a portion of such tax credit, the Borrower shall promptly remit to such Bank the amount certified by such Bank to be the amount necessary to restore such Bank to the position it would have been in if no payment had been made pursuant to this sentence.

Judgment Currency.
 
If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due under this Agreement in Dollars or any alternative currency (the "Specified Currency") into another currency (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered.  The obligation of the Borrower with respect to any such sum due from it to the Agent or any Bank (each, an "Entitled Person") shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due under this Agreement in the Judgment Currency, such Entitled Person may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase and transfer to the required location of payment the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to
indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the applicable Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred on that Business Day.
 
6.7
                              
Defaulting Banks.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank:
 
(a)           fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Bank pursuant to Section 4.1;
 
(b)           the Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Bank shall not be included in determining whether the Required Banks have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 12.4); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Bank in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Bank or each Bank affected thereby;
 
(c)           if any Swingline Advances are outstanding at the time such Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank then:
 
(i)            all or any part of such Defaulting Bank's participation in Swingline Advances shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Banks in accordance with their respective Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Banks' Committed Outstandings plus such Defaulting Bank's Percentage of Swingline Advances does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Banks' Commitments;
 
(ii)           if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Agent prepay such Swingline Advances to the extent not so reallocated; and
 
(d)           so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank, the Swingline Bank shall not be required to fund any Swingline Advance unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Banks, and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Advance shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Banks in a manner consistent with Section 6.7(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Bank shall not participate therein).
 
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Bank shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Bank has a good faith belief that any Bank has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Bank commits to extend credit, the Swingline Bank shall not be required to fund any Swingline Advance unless the Swingline Bank shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Bank, satisfactory to the Swingline Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such Bank hereunder.
 
In the event that the Agent, the Borrower and the Swingline Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Bank has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Bank to be a Defaulting Bank, then the participations of the Banks in Swingline Advances shall be readjusted to reflect
the inclusion of such Bank's Commitment and on such date such Bank shall purchase at par such of the Advances of the other Banks (other than Bid Loans and Swingline Advances) as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Bank to hold such Advances in accordance with its Percentage.

These covenants were negotiated by the Banks and the Borrower based on information provided to the Banks by the Borrower.  A breach of a covenant is an indication that the risk of the transaction has increased.  In consideration for any waiver or modification of these covenants, the Banks may require: collateral or other credit support; higher fees or interest rates; and/or revised loan documentation or monitoring.  Any covenant waiver or modification will be made in the sole discretion of the Required Banks.  The foregoing in no way limits the rights of the Agent and Banks under Section 10 of this Agreement.

AGENCY
 
11
.1
                       
Authorization.
 
Each Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act on behalf of such Bank to the extent provided herein or in any document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, and to take such other action as may be reasonably incidental thereto.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Banks, and such instruments shall be binding upon all Banks.
 
11
.2
                       
Distribution of Payments and Proceeds.
 
(a)
                                 
After deduction of any costs of collection as hereinafter provided in Section 11.3, any fees specified herein or in any Fee Letter, and any servicing fee provided in any agreement between the Agent and the applicable Bank, the Agent shall remit to each Bank that Bank's Percentage of all payments of principal, interest, fees and other payments that are received by the Agent under the Loan Documents.  Each Bank's interest in the Loan Documents shall be payable solely from payments, collections and proceeds actually received by the Agent under the Loan Documents; and the Agent's only liability to the Banks hereunder shall be to account for each Bank's Percentage of such payments, collections and proceeds in accordance with this Agreement.  If the Agent is ever required for any reason to refund any such payments, collections or proceeds, each Bank will refund to the Agent, upon demand, its Percentage of such payments, collections or proceeds, together with its Percentage of interest or penalties, if any, payable by the Agent in connection with such refund.  The Agent may, in its sole discretion, make payment to the Banks in anticipation of receipt of payment from the Borrower.  If the Agent fails to receive any such anticipated payment from the Borrower, each Bank shall promptly refund to the Agent, upon demand, any such payment made to it in anticipation of payment from the Borrower, together with interest for each
day on such amount until so refunded at a rate equal to (A) the Federal Funds Rate, in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies, for each such date.
 
(b)
                                
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Bank has wrongfully refused to fund its Percentage of any Borrowing or other advance as required hereunder, or if the principal balance of any Bank's Advances is for any other reason less than its Percentage of the aggregate principal balances of the Advances, the Agent may remit all payments received by it to the other Banks until such payments have reduced the aggregate amounts owed by the Borrower to the extent that the aggregate amount owing to such Bank hereunder is equal to its Percentage of the aggregate amount owing to all of the Banks hereunder.  The provisions of this paragraph are intended only to set forth certain rules for the application of payments, proceeds and collections in the event that a Bank has breached its obligations hereunder and shall not be deemed to excuse any Bank from such obligations.
 
(c)
                                 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments designated by the Borrower as pertaining to any Bid Loan shall be paid by the Agent (after deduction of costs of collection as hereinafter provided) to the applicable Bank holding such Bid Loan, without regard to such Bank's Percentage.
 
11
.3
                       
Expenses.
 
All payments, collections and proceeds received or effected by the Agent may be applied, first, to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable costs, expenses, damages and liabilities at any time incurred by or imposed upon the Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including but not limited to all reasonable attorney's fees, foreclosure expenses and advances made to protect the security of any collateral), except to the extent that the Agent shall have previously received reimbursement of such costs, expenses, damages or liabilities from the Borrower.  If the Agent does not receive payments, collections or proceeds sufficient to cover any such costs, expenses, damages or liabilities within five (5) calendar days after their incurrence or imposition, each Bank shall, upon demand, remit to the Agent its Percentage of the difference between (i) such costs, expenses, damages and liabilities, and (ii) such payments, collections and proceeds; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such costs, expenses, damages and liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.
 
11
.4
                       
Payments Received Directly by Banks.
 
If any Bank shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise) on account of principal of or interest on any Revolving Advances other than through distributions made in accordance with Section 11.2, such Bank shall promptly give notice of such fact to the Agent and shall purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Revolving Advances as shall be necessary to cause the purchasing Bank to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchasing Bank restored to the extent of such recovery (but without interest thereon).  The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 11.4 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
11
.5
                       
Indemnification.
 
Each Bank severally (but not jointly) hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, as well as the Agent's agents, employees, officers and directors, ratably according to the respective Percentages of each of the Banks from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs, disbursements, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of any kind or nature whatsoever, which are imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent or its agents, employees, officers or directors in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of any such losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs, disbursements, or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
 
11
.6
                       
Limitations on Agent's Power.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Agent shall not have the power, without the written consent of all of the Banks, to (i) forgive any indebtedness of the Borrower arising under this Agreement, (ii) agree to reduce the rate of interest or fees charged under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (iii) agree to extend the due date for payment of principal, interest, fees or any other amount due under this Agreement, (iv) extend the Commitment Termination Date or increase the amount of any of the Commitments except as provided in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, (v) amend the definition of "Required Banks," (vi) amend this Section 11.6, Section 12.4 or Section 12.5 of this Agreement, or any provision herein providing for consent or other action by all Banks, (vii) amend any provision for the pro rata treatment of the Banks with respect to the sharing of payments of principal or interest or the making of Advances, or (viii) release the Borrower from personal liability on account of its obligations hereunder, including the Borrower's obligations under Section 3.
 
11
.7
                       
Exculpation of the Agent by the Banks.
 
The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters, and upon any writing which it believes to be genuine or to have been presented by a proper person.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall (a) be responsible to any of the Banks for any recitals, representations or warranties contained in, or for the
execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other instrument or document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (b) be responsible to any of the Banks for the validity, genuineness, perfection, effectiveness, enforceability, existence, value or enforcement of any collateral security, (c) be under any duty to any of the Banks to inquire into or pass upon any of the foregoing matters, or to make any inquiry concerning the performance by the Borrower or any other obligor of its obligations, or (d) in any event, be liable to any of the Banks for any action taken or omitted by it or them, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
11
.8
                       
Agent and Affiliates.
