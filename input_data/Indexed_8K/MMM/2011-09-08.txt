(a)
          
On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each of the Agents hereby severally and not jointly agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and receive offers to purchase the Securities from the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Disclosure Package and Prospectus.  So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to any Agent, the Company may, without requiring the consent of or payment of commissions to such Agent, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any debt securities with a maturity at the time of original issuance of 9 months to 30 years.  The Company reserves the right to sell, and may solicit and accept offers to purchase, Securities directly on its own behalf, and, in the case of any such sale not resulting from a solicitation made by any Agent, no commission will be payable with respect to such sale.  These provisions shall not limit Section 4(f) hereof or any similar provision included in any Terms Agreement.
 
Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Securities, the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities and the payment in each case therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure attached hereto as Annex II as it may be amended from time to time by written agreement between the Agents and the Company (the "Administrative Procedure").  The provisions of the Administrative Procedure shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder other than those made pursuant to a Terms Agreement.  Each Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them in the Administrative Procedure.  The solicitation of offers to purchase Securities will be made in a manner consistent with such reasonable guidelines developed from time to time by the Company as agreed with the Agents.  The Company will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Administrative Procedure as from time to time in effect.
 
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities.  As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day in New York City, after receipt of notice from the Company, the Agents will suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.  During such period, the Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k).  Upon advising the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed, however, the Company shall simultaneously provide the documents required to be delivered by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k), and the Agents shall have no obligation to solicit offers to purchase the Securities until such documents have been received by the Agents.  In addition, any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations to deliver the documents required by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k) shall automatically suspend the Agents' obligations hereunder, including without limitation its obligations to solicit offers to purchase the Securities hereunder as agent or to purchase Securities hereunder as principal, until such time as the documents required to be delivered by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k) are received by the Agents.
 
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, at the time of settlement of any sale of a Security by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to the following applicable percentage of the principal amount of such Security sold:
 
The Agents may offer the Securities they have purchased as principal to other dealers.  The Agents may sell Securities to any dealer at a discount and such discount allowed to any dealer may include all or part of the discount to be received by such Agents from the Company.
 
(b)
          
Each sale of Securities to any Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless the Company and such Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement which will provide for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase thereof by, such Agent.  A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Securities by such Agent.  The commitment of any Agent to purchase Securities as principal, whether pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.  Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of Securities to be purchased by any Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company for such Securities, any provisions relating to rights of, and default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of the Securities and the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for such Securities.  Such Terms Agreement shall also specify any requirements for opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates pursuant to Section 4 hereof.  Each Agent proposes to offer Securities purchased by it as principal for sale at prevailing market prices or prices related thereto at the time of sale, which may be equal to, greater than or less than the price at which such Securities are purchased by such Agent from the Company.
 
For each sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of such Securities and payment therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure.  For each such sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company agrees to pay such Agent a commission (or grant an equivalent discount) as provided in Section 2(a) hereof and in accordance with the schedule set forth therein.
Each time and date of delivery of and payment for Securities to be purchased by an Agent as principal, whether set forth in a Terms Agreement or in accordance with the Administrative Procedure, is referred to herein as a "Time of Delivery".
 
(c)

filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed not misleading; and
 
(xvi)        The Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements or data and related schedules included therein or the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead him to believe (i) that, as of its effective date or any deemed effective date with respect to the Agents pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2), the Registration Statement or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than financial statements or data and related schedules included therein or the Form T-1, as to which such counsel makes no statement) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion, as of the date of the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement or as of the date of such opinion, (other than the financial statements or data and related schedules included therein, as to which such counsel makes no statement) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) that the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time or as of the date of such opinion (other than financial statements or data and related schedules included therein, as to which such counsel makes no statement), included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
 
(d)           Not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Commencement Date and on each applicable date referred to in Section 4(j) hereof that is on or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the independent registered public accounting firm that has certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to such Agent a
letter, dated the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto;
 
(e)           (i)            Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, that would result in a Material Adverse Effect, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of such Agent so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation by such Agent of offers to purchase Securities from the Company or the purchase by such Agent of Securities from the Company as principal, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, provided, however, that in the case where any Agent purchases Securities as principal, the references to the "Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented" in clauses (i) and (ii) shall refer to the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement;
 
(f)            There shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets of the United States, any material interruption in the clearance and settlement systems in the United States or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or the declaration of a national emergency or war if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of such Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities or the purchase of Securities from the Company as principal, pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or otherwise, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (v) any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; or (vi) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; and
 
(g)           The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to such Agent certificates of officers of the Company dated the Commencement Date and each applicable date referred to in Section 4(k) hereof that is on or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of
Delivery, as the case may be, in such form and executed by such officers of the Company as shall be satisfactory to such Agent, as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section 6, and as to such other matters as such Agent may reasonably request.
 
7.
                                     
(a)           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed under Rule 433(d) under the Act, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein.
 
(b)           Each Agent severally will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other /indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Securities purchased by or through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
 
(e)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
8.
                                     
Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other than in respect to any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal.  Each Agent will make reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason.  If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that solicited such offer any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.
 
9.
                                     
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties, covenants and other statements, if any, by any Agent and the Company set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Company, or any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities.
10.
                              
The provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company as to any Agent or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such suspension or termination to such Agent or the Company, as the case may be.  In the event of such suspension or termination with respect to any Agent, (x) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has not occurred, (y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued or which relate to Securities which are already issued, agreed to be issued or the subject of a pending offer at the time of such suspension or termination and (z) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar as the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), Section 4(d), Section 4(e), Section 5, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof are concerned.
 
11.
                              
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Administrative Procedure, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Agents shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to:
 
and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to 3M Office of General Counsel, 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota 55133, Facsimile Transmission No. (612) 736-9469, Attention:  Gregg Larson.
 
12.
                              
The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Agents, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Agent is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Agent has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Agent has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement or an applicable Terms Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Agents, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
13.
                              
This Agreement and any Terms Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, each Agent and the Company, and to the extent provided in Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and any person who controls any Agent or the Company, and their respective personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities through or from any Agent hereunder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
14.
                              
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Agents are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as information that will allow the Agents to properly identify their respective clients.
 
15.
                              
Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement and any Terms Agreement.  As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the office of the Commission in Washington, D.C. is normally open for business.
 
16.
                              
This Agreement and any Terms Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
 
17.
                              
This Agreement and any Terms Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us two counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and you in accordance with its terms.
ANNEX I
 
         , 2011
Dear Sirs:
 
3M Company, (the "Company") proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and in the Distribution Agreement, dated September 2, 2011 (the "Distribution Agreement"), between the Company on the one hand and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and UBS Securities LLC (the "Agents") on the other, to issue and sell to the securities specified in Schedule I hereto (the "Purchased Securities").  Each of the provisions of the Distribution Agreement not specifically related to the solicitation by the Agents, as agents of the Company, of offers to purchase Securities is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and shall be deemed to be part of this Terms Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein.  Nothing contained herein or in the Distribution Agreement shall make any party hereto an agent of the Company or make such party subject to the provisions therein relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company, solely by virtue of its execution of this Terms Agreement.  Each of the representations and warranties set forth therein shall be deemed to have been made at and as of the date of this Terms Agreement, except that each representation and warranty in Section 1 of the Distribution Agreement which makes reference to the Prospectus
[INSERT RELEVANT AGENT(s)]
 
shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty as of the date of the Distribution Agreement in relation to the Prospectus (as therein defined), and also a representation and a warranty as of the date of this Terms Agreement in relation to the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to relate to the Purchased Securities.
 
An amendment to the Registration Statement, or a supplement to the Prospectus, as the case may be, relating to the Purchased Securities, in the form heretofore delivered to you is now proposed to be filed with the Commission.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Distribution Agreement incorporated herein by reference, the Company agrees to issue and sell to and such Agent[s] agree[s] to purchase from the Company the Purchased Securities, at the time and place, in the principal amount and at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto.
[INSERT RELEVANT AGENTS]
 
If one or more of the Agents shall fail at the Time of Delivery to purchase the Purchased Securities (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the nondefaulting Agents shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one of them or one or more other Agents to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; provided however, that if such arrangements shall not have been completed within such 24-hour period, then:
 
(a)
          
if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Purchased Securities, the nondefaulting Agents shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective initial obligations under this Terms Agreement bear to the obligations of all nondefaulting Agents under this Terms Agreement; or
 
(b)
          
if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Purchased Securities, this Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent.
 
No action taken pursuant to this paragraph above shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default.  In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Terms Agreement, either the nondefaulting Agents or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us two counterparts hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you this letter and such acceptance hereof, including those provisions of the Distribution Agreement incorporated herein by reference, shall constitute a binding agreement between you and the Company.

Exhibit A to Annex I
ANNEX II
This Administrative Procedure relates to the Securities defined in the Distribution Agreement, dated September 2, 2011 (the "Distribution Agreement"), between 3M Company (the "Company") and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and UBS Securities LLC (together, the "Agents"), to which this Administrative Procedure is attached as Annex II.  Defined terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Distribution Agreement, the Prospectus Supplement as amended or supplemented or the Indenture.
 
The procedures to be followed with respect to the settlement of sales of Securities directly by the Company to purchasers solicited by an Agent, as agent, are set forth below.  The terms and settlement details related to a purchase of Securities by an Agent, as principal, from the Company will be set forth in a Terms Agreement pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, unless the Company and such Agent otherwise agree as provided in Section 2(b) of the Distribution Agreement, in which case the procedures to be followed in respect of the settlement of such sale will be as set forth below.  An Agent, in relation to a purchase of a Security by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a Security by such Agent as principal other than pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the "Purchasing Agent".
 
The Company will advise each Agent in writing of those persons with whom such Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Securities and the related settlement details.
 
Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be represented by either a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary (a "Book-Entry Security") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificated Security") delivered to a person designated by an Agent, as set forth in the applicable Disclosure Package or Pricing Supplement.  An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be entitled to receive a certificate representing such a Security, except as provided in the Indenture.
 
Book-Entry Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure set forth in Part I hereof, and Certificated Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure set forth in Part II hereof.
 
PART I:
                
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES
 
In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Securities for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company to the Depositary and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and the Depositary (as amended
from time to time, the "Certificate Agreement"), and its obligations as a participant in the Depositary, including the Depositary's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").
POSTING RATES BY THE COMPANY:
 
The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Book-Entry Securities that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent.  The Company may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an offering period ("posting").  If the Company decides to change already posted rates, it will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the new posted rates have been established with the Agents.

provided
 
DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
 
The receipt by the Company of immediately available funds in payment for a Book-Entry Security and the authentication and issuance of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security shall constitute "settlement" with respect to such Book-Entry Security.  All orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company on a particular date (the "Trade Date") will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is the third Business Day after the Trade Date pursuant to the "Settlement Procedure Timetable" set forth below, unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on another Business Day which shall be no earlier than the next Business Day after the Trade Date.
 
SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE TIMETABLE:
 
For orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent and accepted by the Company for settlement on the third Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "A" through "I" set forth above shall be completed as soon as possible but not later than the respective times (New York City time) set forth below:
 
If the initial interest rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry Security has not been determined at the time that Settlement Procedure "A" is completed, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date.  Settlement Procedure "H" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the Settlement Date.
 
If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or canceled, the Trustee, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participation Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement Date.
 
FAILURE TO SETTLE:
 
If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry Security pursuant to Settlement Procedure "F", the Trustee may deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing the Depositary to debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account, provided that the Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be debited.  If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will mark such Global Security "canceled", make appropriate entries in the Trustee's records and send such canceled Global Security to the Company.  The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be canceled and not immediately reassigned.  If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities and shall be canceled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Securities previously represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Security.
 
If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in the Depositary, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Book-Entry Security may enter deliver orders through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to such participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's account and then debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and shall notify the Company and the Trustee thereof.  Thereafter, the Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order and the
Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited to the account of the Company maintained at the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedure I, and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph.  If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Security, the Depositary may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect.  In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedure "D", for the authentication and issuance of a Global Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its records.  The Company will, from time to time, furnish the Trustee with a sufficient quantity of Securities.

DELIVERY OF CONFIRMATION, DISCLOSURE PACKAGE AND PROSPECTUS TO PURCHASER BY SELLING AGENT:
 
The Selling Agent will deliver to the purchaser of a Certificated Security a written confirmation of the sale and delivery and payment instructions.  In addition, the Selling Agent will deliver to such purchaser or its agent (i) the Disclosure Package prior to the contract for sale of such Certificated Security; provided that the Company has prepared and delivered such Disclosure Package to the Selling Agent; and (ii) the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement) in relation to such Certificated Security or a notice under
Rule 173 of the Act in lieu thereof prior to or together with the earlier of the delivery to such purchaser or its agent of (a) the confirmation of sale or (b) the Certificated Security.
DATE OF SETTLEMENT:
 
All offers of Certificated Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is the third Business Day after the date of acceptance of such offer, unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement (a) on another Business Day after the acceptance of such offer or (b) with respect to an offer accepted by the Company prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of such acceptance.
 
INSTRUCTION FROM COMPANY TO TRUSTEE FOR PREPARATION OF CERTIFICATED SECURITIES:
 
After receiving the Sale Information from the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, the Company will communicate such Sale Information to the Trustee by telephone (confirmed in writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means.
 
The Company will instruct the Trustee by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means to authenticate and deliver the Certificated Securities no later than 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on the Settlement Date.  Such instruction will be given by the Company prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date unless the Settlement Date is the date of acceptance by the Company of the offer to purchase Certificated Securities in which case such instruction will be given by the Company by 11:00 a.m., New York City time.
 
PREPARATION AND DELIVERY OF CERTIFICATED SECURITIES BY TRUSTEE AND RECEIPT OF PAYMENT THEREFOR:
 
The Trustee will prepare each Certificated Security and appropriate receipts that will serve as the documentary control of the transaction.
 
In the case of a sale of Certificated Securities to a purchaser solicited by a Selling Agent, the Trustee will, by 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on the Settlement Date, deliver the Certificated Securities to the Selling Agent for the benefit of the purchaser of such Certificated Securities against delivery by the Selling Agent of a receipt therefor.  On the Settlement Date the Selling Agent will deliver payment for such Certificated Securities in immediately available funds to the Company in an amount equal to the issue price of the Certificated Securities less the Selling Agent's commission; provided that the Selling Agent reserves the right to withhold payment for which it has not received funds from the purchaser.  The Company shall not use any proceeds advanced by a Selling Agent to acquire securities.
 
In the case of a sale of Certificated Securities to a Purchasing Agent, the Trustee will, by 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on the Settlement Date, deliver the Certificated Securities to the Purchasing Agent against delivery of payment for such Certificated Securities in immediately available funds to the Company in an amount equal to the issue price of the Certificated Securities less the Purchasing Agent's discount.
FAILURE OF PURCHASER TO PAY SELLING AGENT:
 
If a purchaser (other than a Purchasing Agent) fails to make payment to the Selling Agent for a Certificated Security, the Selling Agent will promptly notify the Trustee and the Company thereof by telephone (confirmed in writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means.  The Selling Agent will immediately return the Certificated Security to the Trustee.  Immediately upon receipt of such Certificated Security by the Trustee, the Company will return to the Selling Agent an amount equal to the amount previously paid to the Company in respect of such Certificated Security.  The Company will reimburse the Selling Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of funds during the period when they were credited to the account of the Company.
 
The Trustee will cancel the Certificated Security in respect of which the failure occurred, make appropriate entries in its records and, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, destroy the Certificated Security.

Pursuant to Section 4(j) and Section 6(d), as the case may be, of the Distribution Agreement, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm shall furnish letters to the effect that:
 
(i)
                                    
They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
 
(ii)
                                 
In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules audited (and, if applicable, financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information and/or condensed financial statement derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the Agents;
 
(iii)
                              
They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the PCAOB of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and/or included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as indicated in their reports thereon copies of which have been separately furnished to the Agents; and on the basis of specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
 
(iv)
                             
The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement and reclassification where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for the

(v)
                                
On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
(A)
                              
(i) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and/or included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder or (ii) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in cash flows included in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
 
(B)
                              
as of a specified date representing the latest full month that unaudited consolidated financial data was furnished by the Company, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and purchase by the Company under its program of repurchasing its common stock) or any increases in consolidated long-term debt of the Company, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity or other items specified by the Agents, or any increases in any items specified by the Agents, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter;
 
(C)
                              
for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in Clause (B) there were any decreases in
consolidated net revenues or consolidated net income or other items specified by the Agents, or any increases in any items specified by the Agents, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Agents, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter;
(D)
                              
the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements referred to in Clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and referred to in Clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(E)
                               
any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
 
(F)
                                
as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and purchase by the Company under its program of repurchasing its common stock) or any increases in consolidated long-term debt of the Company, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity or other items specified by the Agents, or any increases in any items specified by the Agents, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and

(vi)
                             
In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (vi) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Agents which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Agents or in documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus specified by the Agents, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
