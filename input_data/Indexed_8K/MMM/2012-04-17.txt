On page 9 of the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 21, 2012, the Company describes the responsibilities of the Board's Lead Independent Director, a position currently held by Dr. Vance Coffman.  One of those responsibilities states that the Lead Independent Director "provides input into the materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each Board meeting and provides feedback regarding the quality, quantity, and timeliness of those materials."  This particular duty not only gives the Lead Independent Director approval authority with respect to materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each Board meeting but also provides a feedback mechanism so that the materials may be improved for future meetings.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
