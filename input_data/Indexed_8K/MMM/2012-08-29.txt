Thereafter, the Bank may send a new notice during each calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore the Bank's Return for that quarter.  The Bank's calculation in any such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.

Mitigation of Yield Protection.
 
The Bank hereby agrees that, commencing as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 5.2 or 6.4, the Bank will give notice thereof to the Borrower.  The Borrower may at any time, by notice to the Bank, request that the Bank change its lending office as to any Unreimbursed L/C Obligations or that it specify a new lending office with respect to its Commitment and any Letters of Credit or that it rebook any Letter of Credit with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences of an occurrence such as described in the preceding sentence, and the Bank will use reasonable efforts to comply with such request unless, in the opinion of the Bank, such change or specification or rebooking is inadvisable or might have an adverse effect,
 
economic or otherwise, upon it, including its reputation.  In addition, the Bank agrees that, except for changes or specifications or rebookings required by law or effected pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the result of any change or change of specification of lending office or rebooking would, but for this sentence, be to impose additional costs or requirements upon the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.2 or Section 6.4 (which would not be imposed absent such change or change of specification or rebooking) by reason of legal or regulatory requirements in effect at the time thereof and of which the Bank is aware at such time, then such costs or requirements shall not be imposed upon the Borrower but shall be borne by the Bank.  All expenses incurred by the Bank in changing a lending office or specifying another lending office of the Bank or rebooking any Letter of Credit in response to a request from the Borrower shall be paid by the Borrower.  Nothing in this Section 5.3 (including, without limitation, any failure by the Bank to give any notice contemplated in the first sentence hereof) shall limit, reduce or postpone any obligations of the Borrower under Section 5.2 or Section 6.4, including any obligations payable in respect of any period prior to the date of any change or specification of a new lending office or any rebooking of any Letter of Credit.

(a)
                                
Generally.
  The Borrower shall initiate all payments of principal, interest, fees and other payments due under the Notes or this Agreement (including but not limited to all payments due under Section 2.1(d), Section 3 or any Reimbursement Agreement) and all prepayments with respect to the Notes or this Agreement to the Bank by means of payment made by the Borrower to the Bank in Dollars not later than 12:00 noon in same day funds for the account of the Bank.  All such payments shall be made in immediately available funds.  Any payment due on a day on which the Bank is not open for substantially all of its business shall be due on the next day on which the Bank is so open.  Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fee or commission, as the case may be.  Absent obvious error, the records of the Bank will be conclusive evidence of the principal and accrued interest owing with respect to all Unreimbursed L/C Obligations.
 
(b)

Termination or Reduction of the Commitment.
 
The Borrower may from time to time on at least ten calendar days' prior notice received by the Bank terminate the Commitment in whole or permanently reduce the Commitment in part, provided that (i) the Commitment may not be terminated in whole at any time that any Letter of Credit or Unreimbursed L/C Obligation remains outstanding, (ii) each partial reduction of the Commitment shall be in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 or in a multiple of $10,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) no partial reduction of the Commitment shall reduce the aggregate amount of the Commitment to an amount less than the L/C Amount.

Taxes.
 
(a)
                                
All payments made by the Borrower to the Bank under or in connection with this Agreement or the Notes shall be made without any setoff or other counterclaim, and free and clear of and without deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or other authority, except to the extent that such deduction or withholding is compelled by law.  As used herein, the term "Taxes" shall include all income, excise and other taxes of whatever nature (other than taxes generally assessed on the overall net income of the Bank by the government or other authority of the country, state or political subdivision in which the Bank is incorporated or in which the office through which the Bank is acting is located) as well as all levies, imposts, duties, charges, or fees of whatever nature.  If the Borrower is compelled by law to make any such deductions or withholdings it will:
 
(i)
                                    
pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;
 
(ii)
                                 
except to the extent that such deduction or withholding results from a breach by the Bank of the representations contained in Section 6.4(b), pay such additional amounts (including, without limitation, any penalties, interest or expenses) as may be necessary in order that the net amount received by the Bank after such deductions or withholdings (including any required deduction or withholding on such additional amounts) shall equal the amount the Bank would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made; and
 
(iii)
                              
promptly forward to the Bank an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Bank evidencing such payment to such authorities.
 
(b)
                                
If any Taxes otherwise payable by the Borrower pursuant to the foregoing paragraph are directly asserted against the Bank, the Bank may pay such Taxes and the Borrower promptly shall reimburse the Bank to the full extent otherwise required by such paragraph.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 6.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Bank by its execution of this Agreement does hereby represent to the Borrower that if the Bank is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the Bank has furnished to the Borrower either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, as applicable (wherein the Bank claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder).
 
(c)
                                 
If the Borrower makes an increased tax payment to the Bank under the foregoing clause (a)(ii) and the Bank determines in its absolute discretion that (a) a tax credit is attributable to that tax payment, and (b) the Bank has obtained, utilized and fully retained that tax credit on an affiliated group basis, then the Bank shall pay an amount to the Borrower which the Bank determines in its absolute discretion will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-tax position as it would have been in had the payment under clause (a)(ii) not been required to be made by the Borrower; provided, however, that (i) the Bank shall be the sole judge of the amount of such tax credit and the date on which it is received, (ii) the Bank shall not be obliged to disclose information regarding its tax affairs or tax computations, (iii) nothing herein shall interfere with the Bank's right to manage its tax affairs in whatever manner it sees fit, and (iv) if the Bank shall subsequently determine that it has lost the credit of all or a portion of such tax credit, the Borrower shall promptly remit to the Bank the amount certified by the Bank to be the amount necessary to restore the Bank to the position it would have been in if no payment had been made pursuant to this sentence.

Judgment Currency.
 
If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due under this Agreement in Dollars or any alternative currency (the "Specified Currency") into another currency (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Bank could purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered.  The obligation of the Borrower with respect to any such sum due from it to the Bank shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Bank of any sum adjudged to be due under this Agreement in the Judgment Currency, the Bank may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase and transfer to the required location of payment the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify the Bank against, and to pay the Bank on demand, in the applicable Specified
Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to the Bank in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred on that Business Day.
