(310) 279-5980 Hansen Natural Reports Record First Quarter Sales and Profits; --Net Sales Increase 91.7 percent, Net Income Quadruples CORONA, Calif., May 10, 2005 -- Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record financial results, including sharp increases in sales and profits, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005. Gross sales for the first quarter increased 90.3 percent to $73.7 million from $38.7 million a year earlier. Net sales for the first quarter increased 91.7 percent to $60.0 million from $31.3 million a year ago. Operating income for the first quarter quadrupled to $14.7 million from $3.6 million a year ago. Net income for the first quarter also quadrupled to $8.8 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, from $2.2 million or $0.19 per diluted share, last year. Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said the exceptional performance reflected record sales of Monster Energy(TM) drinks, including Lo-Carb Monster Energy(TM) drinks, as well as Monster Energy(TM) "Assault"(TM) energy drinks which were introduced in September 2004 and Lost(R) Energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004, as well as sales of Joker(TM) energy drinks in 16-ounce cans which were introduced in January 2005, and increases in sales, primarily of Hansen's(R) apple juice and juice blends, as well as Hansen's(R) children's multi-vitamin juice drinks in aseptic packaging. The increase in sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of Rumba(TM) energy juice, which was introduced in December 2004. The sales increase was partially offset primarily by lower sales of Hansen's(R) Natural Sodas, Hansen's energy and functional drinks, Energade(R) energy sports drinks, E20 Energy Water(R) drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter increased to 50.5 percent, from 44.4 percent for the comparable 2004 quarter. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.0 percent, from 32.7 percent in the previous year.
