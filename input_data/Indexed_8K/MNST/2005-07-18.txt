Shareholders will be entitled to receive one additional share for each share held. The new shares will be distributed via mail or electronically on or after August 8, 2005 to the record holders of the Company's common stock as of the close of business (EST) on August 1, 2005. As of today, there are approximately 11.05 million shares of the Company's common stock outstanding. After the distribution of the stock dividend, there will be approximately 22.10 million shares of the Company's common stock outstanding. Fractional shares resulting from the stock dividend will be paid in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price of the Common Stock on August 1, 2005. The Company expects that its stock will begin to trade on a post-split basis on August 9, 2005. "The board's action conveys its confidence in the long-term prospects for Hansen," said Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer.
