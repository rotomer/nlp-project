Net sales for the first half of 2005 were up 88.0 percent to $145.5 million from $77.4 million a year ago.

On July 18, 2005, the company announced a 2-for-1 split of Hansen Natural common stock, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, distributed via mail or electronically on or after August 8, 2005 to record holders of the company's common stock as of the close of business (EST) on August 1, 2005. It is anticipated that the stock will begin trading on a post-split basis today, August 9, 2005. Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said the exceptional performance reflected record sales of Monster EnergyTM drinks, which includes low carbohydrate ("Lo-Carb") Monster EnergyTM drinks, as well as sales of Monster EnergyTM "Assault"TM energy drinks which were introduced in September 2004, increases in sales by volume, primarily of Hansen's(r) and Junior Juice(r) children's juice drinks in aseptic packaging and Hansen's(r) apple juice and juice blends. The increase in net sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of Lost(r) Energy drinks, introduced in January 2004, JokerTM energy drinks, introduced in January 2005, and RumbaTM energy juice, introduced in December 2004. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Hansen's(r) energy and functional drinks, including Deuce energy in 16-ounce cans, private label isotonic beverages, E2O Energy Water(r) drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter increased to 52.6 percent, from 45.1 percent for the comparable 2004 quarter. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.9 percent, from 26.8 percent in the previous year.
