Hansen's continues to excel in its markets.
 - 
                 
 
The Hansen's brand is respected and trusted in the marketplace by an extremely loyal base of consumers.
 - 
                 
 
The premium healthier brand image enjoyed by Hansen's Natural Sodas offers unlimited opportunity to capture substantial additional share of the CSD market, through national distribution.
 - 
                 
 
Monster, Lost, Hansen's Energy, Energade and Rumba provide an unparalleled platform to lead the energy category (together with Red Bull).  In fact, as this category continues to grow, the Hansen's portfolio is better positioned to address the broader, emerging consumer base than Red Bull or any of the competition.
