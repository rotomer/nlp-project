(310) 279-5980 HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2005 YEAR Net Income Triples; Net Sales up 93% Corona, CA March 9, 2006 Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today announced record sales and profits for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. For the 2005 year, gross sales rose 85.4 percent to $415.4 million from $224.1 million in 2004. Net sales for 2005 increased 93.5 percent to $348.9 million from $180.3 million in the prior year. Operating income grew 205.3 percent in 2005 to $103.4 million from $33.9 million a year ago. Net income advanced 207.9 percent to $62.8 million, or $2.59 per diluted share, from $20.4 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, a year ago. Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said the record sales and profits for 2005 were primarily attributable to substantially increased sales volumes of the company's Monster Energy(R) drinks and, to a lesser extent, of Lost(R) energy drinks and Joker Mad Energy(TM) drinks. Increased sales volumes of apple juice and apple juice blends also contributed to the record sales. He added that the increase in sales was partially offset by decreased sales volumes primarily of Hansens(R) Natural Sodas, Hansens energy drinks, Energade(R) and Smoothies in cans. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year rose to 52.3 percent from 46.3 percent in 2004, primarily due to increased sales of higher margin Monster Energy(TM) and Lost(R) energy drinks. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were lower than in the previous year.
For the 2005 fourth quarter, gross sales rose 83.9 percent to $113.6 million from $61.8 million a year earlier. Net sales increased 94.7 percent to $98.0 million from $50.3 million in 2004. Operating income increased to $29.8 million from $11.9 million a year ago. Net income increased to $18.4 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, from $7.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the comparable period in 2004. The increase in net income for the fourth quarter compared with the prior year period was primarily attributable to the substantial increase in sales volumes of Monster Energy(TM) drinks. Sacks also said that sales of Monster Energy(TM) "Khaos" energy drinks was encouraging. Hansen Natural Corporation markets and distributes Hansens(R) Natural Sodas, Signature Sodas, fruit juice Smoothies, Energy drinks, Energade(R) energy sports drinks, E20 Energy Water(R), Sparkling Lemonades and Orangeades, multi-vitamin juice drinks in aseptic packaging, Junior Juice juice(R), iced teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, apple juice, cider and juice blends, Blue Sky(R) brand carbonated beverages, Monster Energy(TM) brand energy drinks, Lost(R) Energy brand energy drinks, Joker Mad Energy(TM) and Rumba(TM) brand energy drinks and Fizzit(TM) brand Powdered drink mixes.
