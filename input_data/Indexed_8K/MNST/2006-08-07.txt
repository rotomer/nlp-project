HANSEN NATURAL REPORTS
RECORD SECOND QUARTER SALES AND PROFITS
 
-- Net Sales Increase 82.6 percent, Net Income Increases 85.0 percent --
 
Corona, CA
 August 7, 2006  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record financial results, including sharp increases in sales and profits, for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006.
Gross sales for the second quarter increased 77.7 percent to $182.1 million from $102.5 million a year earlier. Net sales for the second quarter increased 82.6 percent to $156.0 million from $85.4 million a year ago.
Operating income for the second quarter increased to $45.8 million from $25.4 million a year ago. Net income for the second quarter increased 85.0 percent to $28.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share on a post-split basis ($1.14 per diluted share on a pre-split basis), from $15.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share on a post-split basis ($0.63 per diluted share on a pre-split basis), last year.
Gross sales for the six months ended June 30, 2006 increased 82.3 percent to $319.9 million from $175.5 million a year earlier. Net sales for the first half of 2006 were up 89.6 percent to $275.8 million from $145.5 million a year ago.

increased 104.6 percent to $49.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share on a post-split basis ($2.00 per diluted share on a pre-split basis), from $24.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share on a post-split basis ($0.99 per diluted share on a pre-split basis), last year.
On June 12, 2006, the Company announced a 4-for-1 split of Hansen Natural common stock, which began trading on a post-split basis on July 10, 2006.
The quarterly results are stated after fully expensing the cost of shelf programs which were negotiated in the second quarter. Such programs have become significant in the Company's merchandising strategy and normally have a duration of twelve months. The results are also stated after expensing stock option expenses, of $1.7 million before tax, during the quarter.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said the exceptional performance reflected record sales of Monster Energy
brand energy drinks, which more than doubled over the comparable period last year. "While the energy category continues to show strong growth over the prior year, the growth of Monster continues to outpace all of its major competitors. Monster gained both increased distribution and market share during the quarter," Sacks said. He also noted that the Company had achieved record sales during the second quarter without the benefit of the anticipated distribution arrangements with selected Anheuser-Busch wholesalers which did not commence during the quarter.
"During July, Florida was the first state to be transitioned to the Anheuser-Busch wholesaler network. Additional areas are in the process of being transitioned to selected Anheuser-Busch wholesalers during the third quarter," added Sacks. He also noted that amounts expensed for merchandise displays during the quarter were $2.3 million higher than in the comparable quarter last year, partly in anticipation of the changeover to Anheuser- Busch wholesalers. In addition, the Company significantly increased inventory levels to prepare for such changeover.
The increase in net sales for the 2006 second quarter was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to increases in sales by volume, primarily of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails and apple juice and juice blends.
The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Hansen's energy drinks, Smoothies in cans, Energade and Hansen's Natural Sodas.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter decreased slightly to 51.9 percent, from 52.6 percent for the comparable 2005 quarter, largely due to the Company fully expensing the cost of shelf programs in the quarter.
The Company will host an investor conference call on August 7, 2006 at 11:30 a.m. Pacific Time (2:30 p.m. Eastern Time). The conference call will be open to all interested investors through a live audio web broadcast via the internet at www.hansens.com and www.earnings.com. For those who are not able to listen to the live broadcast, the call will be archived for approximately one year on both websites.
