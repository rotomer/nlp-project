Item 3.01.
 
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 
On January 4, 2007, Hansen Natural Corporation (the "Company") notified the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") that the Company may have inadvertently violated Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(A). The notification related to the Company's inadvertent issuance of an out-of-plan stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of the Company's common stock (pre stock splits) to an outside director of the Company in November 2004. The time within which the plan permitted the award of options had expired approximately four months earlier. The Company is exploring with Nasdaq staff appropriate steps to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible.
