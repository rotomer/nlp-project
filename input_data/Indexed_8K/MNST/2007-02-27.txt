On October 31, 2006, the Company announced that it had received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC') requesting that it voluntarily produce certain documents and information relating to the filing of SEC Forms 4 and the Company's stock option grant practices.
On November 6, 2006, the Company announced that it had appointed a special committee to undertake a special investigation of certain option grants. The special committee has retained independent counsel to conduct the investigation, which is ongoing. Pending the conclusion of the investigation, the Company has determined to report only selected financial information for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said the record revenues reflected continued strong sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks, as well as the expansion of distribution of Unbound
brand energy drinks and
Rumba brand
energy juice. "The energy category continued to show strong growth over the prior year, and the Monster Energy brand continued to grow well in excess of the market. Monster continued to gain increased distribution during the quarter," Sacks said. He also noted that the implementation of the offpremise distribution arrangements with selected Anheuser-Busch wholesalers was progressing well. Sacks added that the Company is planning to implement its on-premise distribution agreement with Anheuser-Busch Inc. as soon as possible, and is proceeding with the implementation of the distribution agreement concluded by the Company with PepsiCo Canada.
The increase in net sales for the 2006 fourth quarter was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to increases in sales by volume, primarily of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails and Junior Juice children's juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Hansen's energy drinks and apple and juice blends.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased from $73.5 million at December 31, 2006 to $133.5 million, after the purchase of 1 million shares of the Company's common stock at an average price of $27.70 per share in the third quarter.
Inventories were increased to meet forecasted demand.
In light of the investigation regarding stock option grants, the Company is not in a position to complete the preparation of the financial statements and certain related information required to be included in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Accordingly, the Company intends to file its Form 10-Q for the third quarter 2006 and Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 as soon as practicable after the completion of the investigation by the special committee.
The Company will host an investor conference call on February 27, 2007 at 10:30 a.m. Pacific Time (1:30 p.m. Eastern Time). The conference call will be open to all interested
