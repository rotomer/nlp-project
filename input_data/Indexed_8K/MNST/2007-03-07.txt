The Juice is Loose
The Magical smells in the air driving to the Monster Energy Pipeline Pro Surf competition on the North Shore of Oahu was our inspiration for new Monster M- 80.
We started with a killer combo of tropical juices, added in some original Monster flavor then souped it up with a full load of our potent Monster Energy blend.
Banzai!
Monster M-80another radical "Juice Monster" hybrid with explosive flavor and the big bad Monster buzz you know and love!
