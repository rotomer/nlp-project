Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On April 20, 2007, Hansen Natural Corporation ("the Company") held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the "Special Meeting") pursuant to a notice and proxy statement together with supplementary information, sent to holders of common stock at the close of business on March 13, 2007. The proposal voted upon at the Special Meeting was an amendment to Section 4(a) of the Company's Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the "1994 Plan"), which extended the time period during which grants may be made under the 1994 Plan through November 30, 2004.
 
As previously disclosed, on January 4, 2007, the Company notified the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") of its inadvertent issuance of an out-of-plan option to purchase 12,000 shares of the Company's common stock (pre stock splits) to an outside director of the Company (the "Option") on November 5, 2004, approximately four months after the expiration date of the 1994 Plan, in apparent violation of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(l)(A). On February 26, 2007, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that among other things, as a condition to the Company's continued listing, the Company must inform the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, on or before May 1, 2007, that the Company has obtained stockholder approval for the granting of the out-of-plan Option grant, or has unwound the Option grant.
 
Stockholder approval for the proposal amending Section 4(a) of the 1994 Plan to extend the time period during which grants may be made under the 1994 Plan through November 30, 2004 was obtained at the Company's Special Meeting thereby encompassing the previously issued out-of-plan Option grant. The Company has informed Nasdaq that such stockholder approval was obtained.
