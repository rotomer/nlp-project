HANSEN NATURAL REPORTS RECORD SALES AND PRELIMINARY SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR FIRST QUARTER 2007
 
-- Company to Host Investor Conference Call Today at 11:30 a.m. PT/2:30 p.m. ET --
 
Corona, CA
 May 7, 2007  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record sales for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
Gross sales for the first quarter increased 37.6% to $189.6 million from $137.8 million a year earlier. Net sales for the first quarter increased 38.1% to $165.4 million from $119.7 million a year ago.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter decreased to 51.5% from 52.6% for the comparable 2006 quarter last year, largely due to increases in certain raw material costs, production costs, inbound freight costs and changes in product mix.
Operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation, as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter, increased to 23.5% from 21.9% for the comparable 2006 quarter, largely as a result of increased marketing costs and selling expenses.
On October 31, 2006, the Company announced that it had received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC') requesting that it voluntarily produce certain documents and information relating to the filing of SEC Forms 4 and the Company's stock option grant practices.
On November 6, 2006, the Company announced that it had appointed a

special committee to undertake a special investigation of certain option grants. On March 23, 2007, the Company announced that the special committee had substantially completed its special investigation, and reported its findings.
  
Pending the filing of all delinquent periodic reports, the Company has determined to report only selected financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said the record revenues reflected continued strong sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks, as well as the expansion of distribution of Unbound brand energy drinks. "The energy category continued to show strong growth over the prior year, and the Monster Energy brand grew well in excess of the market. Monster continued to gain increased distribution during the quarter," Sacks said. The new Monster M-80 energy + juice product in 16-ounce cans was launched in March 2007, and is gaining distribution. The Company is also in the process of launching Java Monster, a new non-carbonated hybrid coffee energy drink in 16-ounce cans, in three flavors.
Sacks also noted that the implementation of the offpremise distribution arrangements with selected Anheuser-Busch wholesalers was progressing well, and effective mid April 2007, the Company commenced distribution arrangements with PepsiCo Canada. Sacks added that the Company is planning to implement its on-premise distribution agreement with Anheuser-Busch Inc. prior to the end of the second quarter.
The increase in net sales for the 2007 first quarter was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to increases in sales by volume, primarily of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of LostEnergy brand energy drinks.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $178.7 million at March 31, 2007 from $133.5 million at December 31, 2006.
As planned, inventories were reduced in line with seasonality.
In light of the investigation regarding stock option grants, the Company is not in a position to complete the preparation of the financial statements and certain related information required to be included in Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Accordingly, the Company intends to file its Form 10-Q for the third quarter 2006, Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2007 as soon as practicable and within any time periods required by Nasdaq to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
