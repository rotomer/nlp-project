Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, said that the record revenues reflected continued strong sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks as well as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007) and Monster M-80 energy (introduced in March 2007). We are excited by the launch in December 2007 of the five new Java Monster line extensions as well as the launch of our new Monster Heavy Metal (introduced in November 2007) and Monster MIXXD (introduced in December 2007). We are extremely pleased by the reception both from the trade and consumers to our new line extensions.
The energy category continues to show strong growth and the Monster Energy brand continues to grow in excess of the overall category growth, Sacks said. Also, Mr. Sacks noted that fourth quarter sales benefited from purchases made by customers in anticipation of the price increase, effective January 1, 2008, in both the 16-ounce Monster Energy and the Java Monster lines.

Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers.
