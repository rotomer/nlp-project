HANSEN NATURAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND
FULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2008
 
-- Fourth Quarter: A Transitional Quarter --
 
2008 Fourth Quarter Highlights:
 
 
Corona, CA
 February 26, 2009  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported financial results for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2008. The results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year were impacted by the transition of certain of the Companys distribution arrangements to newly appointed distributors, including Coca-Cola bottlers and Anheuser-Busch distributors, and by continuing start-up costs in Europe.
As a result of the distributor transitions, the Company incurred termination obligations amounting to $118.2 million and $0.2 million during the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $118.1 million and $15.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to the termination of certain of its prior distributors. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the fourth quarters and years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
Pursuant to new distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, the Company recorded a net amount of $113.3 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, consisting of amounts received or to be received from such distributors relating to the costs of terminating the Companys prior distributors, compared to $0.1 million payable in the 2007 fourth quarter; and for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded corresponding amounts received or receivable of $113.0 million and $21.0 million, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Additionally, in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $12.8 million of deferred revenue, of which $11.6 million related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of its prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Deferred revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $0.5 million.
In connection with the Companys special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, the Company incurred/(received) professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($1.2) million and $9.8 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. No significant amounts were recorded for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.
The following table summarizes the identified items discussed above for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:
 
 
 
Gross sales for the 2008 fourth quarter increased 4.4 percent to $289.6 million from $277.3 million a year earlier. Net sales for the 2008 fourth quarter increased 3.1 percent to $254.4 million from net sales of $246.6 million in the same quarter last year. Both gross and net sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007 were positively impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. The Company estimates that approximately 7 to 8 percent of gross sales for the 2007 fourth quarter were attributable to purchases made by customers in advance of such price increase.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.4 percent for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, compared with 51.0 percent for the 2007 fourth quarter.
Operating expenses for the 2008 fourth quarter increased to $177.6 million from $61.5 million in the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily the result of $118.2 million in termination obligations to prior distributors in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared to $0.2 million in the prior 2007 fourth quarter. Excluding the termination obligations, operating expenses for the 2008 fourth quarter would have been $59.5 million.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 5.4 percent in the same quarter last year.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2008 fourth quarter were 10.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship expenditures and merchandise display costs were lower than in the comparable quarter last year.
General and administrative expenses for the 2008 fourth quarter were $138.8 million, which includes $118.2 million in termination obligations to prior distributors, compared with $20.0 million for the comparable quarter last year. Excluding the termination obligations, general and administrative expenses for the 2008 fourth quarter would have been $20.7 million. Stock based compensation (a non-cash item) was $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $3.9 million in the prior year period.
Operating loss for the 2008 fourth quarter was ($39.2) million compared to operating income of $64.3 million a year ago and net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was ($23.4) million or ($0.25) per diluted share, compared with net income of $45.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share last year. Both the operating loss and net loss for the 2008 fourth quarter were directly impacted by the termination obligations of $118.2 million to prior distributors. Excluding the termination obligations, operating profit for the 2008 fourth quarter would have been $79.0 million.
Net sales for the Companys DSD segment were $231.9 million for the 2008 fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 3.5 percent from $224.2 million for the same period in 2007. Both gross and net sales for the 2007 fourth quarter were positively impacted by the announcement in the fourth quarter of 2007 of a price increase for Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16 ounce cans and Java Monster non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008.
 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States, after the inclusion of sales to certain military customers, were $16.9 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, compared with $15.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2007.
For the 2008 fiscal year, gross sales increased 15.3 percent to $1,182.9 million from $1,025.8 million a year earlier. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 14.3 percent to $1,033.8 million from $904.5 million a year ago.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with 51.7 percent for 2007.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased to $375.2 million from $237.0 million for 2007. The increase in operating expenses is primarily the result of $118.1 million in termination obligations to prior distributors for the year ended December 31, 2008. Such termination costs were $15.3 million in fiscal 2007. Excluding the termination obligations, operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $257.1 million.
Operating income decreased 29.2 percent to $163.6 million from $231.0 million a year ago. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased 27.7 percent to $108.0 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with $149.4 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, last year. Both operating income and net income for the 2008 fiscal year were directly impacted by the termination obligations of $118.1 million to prior distributors. Excluding the termination obligations, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $281.7 million.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record revenues to continued strong sales of Monster Energy drinks, which grew in excess of the category and achieved further gains in market share. In addition, the Company commenced with the launch of its Monster Hitman energy shooters in the fourth quarter of 2008.
We are gratified with the continued strong performance of the Monster Energy brand in the current challenging economic environment. We continue to believe that the moderating growth in the energy drink segment appears, in part, to be due to the existing macro economic environment as well as the resulting decline in store traffic and discretionary spending, added Sacks.
Sacks said that the Companys realignment of its Monster Energy distribution arrangements in selected territories of the United States and Canada to Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (CCE), other Coca-Cola bottlers and new Anheuser-Busch distributors in the United States and Canada was implemented as planned during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively. Distribution of Monster Energy brand energy drinks in the United Kingdom by CCE was delayed until January 2009. Distribution of Monster Energy brand energy drinks in France, Monaco, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg commenced in February 2009. Distribution of Monster Energy brand energy drinks in certain regions of Mexico was successfully transitioned to Comercializadora Eloro, S.A., a subsidiary of Grupo Jumex, in the first quarter of 2009. Sacks also noted that the fourth quarter was impacted not only by the accounting treatment for the transitions, but also by operational issues involved with the scale of the changes.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales are used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers.
