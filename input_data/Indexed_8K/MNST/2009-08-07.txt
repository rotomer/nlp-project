Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
On August 6, 2009, Hansen Natural Corporation ("Hansen") held a previously-announced earnings call relating to its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
 
As discussed on the call, unaudited unadjusted gross sales in July 2009 were approximately $127.1 million, an increase of approximately 13.6% over July 2008. Gross sales of the Monster brand itself, including Java Monster and Hitman, were approximately 17.5% higher than last year, including the UK and Australia. The following correction clarifies Hansen's response to a question from an analyst during the earnings call regarding the information provided above.
 
Clarification
: In response to an analyst's question, Hansen inadvertently stated during the earnings call that unaudited, unadjusted gross sales in the United States in July 2009 increased by just under 7% over July 2008. In fact, the level of increase for North America, not the United States, was approximately 7%. Unaudited, unadjusted gross sales in the United States in July 2009 increased by approximately 1.7% over July 2008.
