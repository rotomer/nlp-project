HANSEN NATURAL REPORTS RECORD 2009 THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
-- Third Quarter Net Sales Rise 8.1% to $307.9 million;
Operating Income Increases 13.6% to $92.9 million --
 
Corona, CA
 November 5, 2009  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record sales and profits for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2009.
Gross sales for the 2009 third quarter increased 9.2 percent to $355.0 million from $325.2 million in the same period last year. Net sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2009 increased 8.1 percent to $307.9 million from $285.0 million a year ago.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2009 third quarter was 53.6 percent, compared with 52.4 percent for the comparable 2008 quarter. Operating expenses for the 2009 third quarter increased to $72.1 million from $67.6 million in the same quarter last year.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.3 percent for the 2009 third quarter, compared with 5.5 percent in the same quarter last year.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2009 third quarter were 12.5 percent, compared with 11.1 percent in the same quarter a year ago.
General and administrative expenses for both the 2009 and 2008 third quarters were $20.3 million. Stock-based compensation (a non-cash item) was $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared with $4.0 million for the third quarter of 2008.
Operating income for the 2009 third quarter increased 13.6 percent to $92.9 million from $81.8 million in the comparable 2008 quarter.
 
Net income for the 2009 third quarter increased 7.8 percent to $56.5 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with $52.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Net sales for the Companys DSD segment increased approximately 9.6 percent to $282.4 million for the 2009 third quarter from $257.7 million for the same period in 2008. Net sales for the Companys
 
warehouse segment were $25.6 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2009, compared with $27.3 million for the same period in 2008.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States, after the inclusion of sales to certain military customers, were $50.0 million in the 2009 third quarter, compared with $30.7 million in the corresponding quarter in 2008.
During the third quarter the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $31.96 per share.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record revenues to sustained strong sales of Monster Energy drinks, which continue to grow in excess of the category and achieve further gains in market share.  We are encouraged by the positive sales numbers reported by Nielsen for the five weeks ended September 26, 2009, which reflect that energy drink sales both in the important convenience and gas channel as well as the grocery channel, on a year-on-year comparable basis, grew for the first time since March 2009, said Sacks.
Sacks also said that the transition to certain Coca-Cola bottlers and new Anheuser-Busch distributors at the end of last year continues to be beneficial as the Companys national market share in both the convenience and gas and grocery channels is now higher than it was prior to the transition. In fact, Monster Energys market share in the important convenience and gas channel increased to 30% for the first time during the five weeks ended September 26, 2009.
According to Nielsen, Monster Energys market share in Canada is also higher than it was prior to the transition to the Coca-Cola system in Canada. Sales in Mexico continue to be satisfactory.
For the nine-months ended September 30, 2009, gross sales increased 9.7 percent to $979.7 million from $893.3 million for the comparable period a year earlier. Net sales for the first nine months of 2009 increased 9.4 percent to $852.4 million from $779.4 million for the same period of 2008.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 53.6 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared with 51.4 percent for the same period last year.
  
Operating expenses for the first three quarters of 2009 increased to $205.6 million from $197.6 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the first nine months of 2009 increased 24.0 percent to $251.5 million from $202.8 million in the corresponding period in 2008.
Net income for the first nine months of 2009 increased 18.2 percent to $155.4 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared with $131.5 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
 
Auction Rate Securities
During the nine-months ended September 30, 2009, the Company redeemed $12.3 million of its auction rate securities at par. At September 30, 2009 the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $100.2 million ($100.5 million at June 30, 2009, $102.0 million at March 31, 2009 and $112.5 million at December 31, 2008). The Company determined that a cumulative impairment of $12.1 million had occurred at September 30, 2009, ($12.3 million as of June 30, 2009, $15.5 million at March 31, 2009 and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2008), of which $7.6 million was deemed temporary and $4.5 million was deemed other than temporary. As a result, included as a component of other comprehensive loss is $4.5 million of accumulated net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax benefits of $3.1 million as of September 30, 2009. Included in other income/(expense) is an other-than-temporary impairment of $0.3 million and $3.9 million for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2009. The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers.

Management cautions that these statements are based on managements current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the control of the Company, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein.
