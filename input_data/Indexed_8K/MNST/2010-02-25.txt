 February 25, 2010  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record financial results for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2009.
Corona, CA
Gross sales for the 2009 fourth quarter increased 13.8 percent to $329.6 million from $289.6 million a year earlier. Net sales for the 2009 fourth quarter increased 14.4 percent to $290.9 million from net sales of $254.4 million in the same quarter last year.
Both gross and net sales for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to the Companys announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to the announcement to transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. The Company estimates that of our gross sales, approximately 4 percent to 6 percent for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and approximately 1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 53.4 percent for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with 54.4 percent for the 2008 fourth quarter.
Operating expenses for the 2009 fourth quarter decreased to $69.4 million from $177.6 million in the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily the result of $0.02 million in termination obligations to prior distributors in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 compared to $118.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the termination obligations, operating expenses for the 2008 fourth quarter would have been $59.5 million.
The comparative results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2008 were impacted by the transition of certain of the Companys distribution arrangements to newly appointed distributors, including Coca-Cola bottlers and Anheuser-Busch distributors, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with 4.9 percent in the same quarter last year.
             Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for both the 2009 and 2008 fourth quarters were 10.4 percent.
General and administrative expenses for the 2009 fourth quarter were $27.4 million, compared with $138.8 million which included $118.2 million in termination obligations to prior distributorsStock based compensation (a non-cash item) was $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $4.1 million in the prior year period.

Operating
Operating income for the 2009 year increased 106.2 percent to $337.3 million from $163.6 million a year ago. Operating income for the 2008 fiscal year was directly impacted by the termination obligations of $118.1 million to prior distributors. Excluding the termination obligations, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $281.7 million.

During the 2009 fourth quarter the Company repurchased 1,008,729 shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $34.91 per share.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record revenues to sustained strong sales of Monster Energy drinks both in the United States and internationally.  We are encouraged by the continued positive sales trends reported by Nielsen, indicating that year-on-year energy drink sales in the United States have increased in each month since September 2009, said Sacks.  Since the transitions to certain Coca-Cola bottlers and new Anheuser-Busch distributors in the fourth quarter of 2008, distribution levels and market share generally for the Monster Energy brand have increased.
 We are planning to introduce new products in 2010 and to continue our international expansion into western and central Europe, the Middle East and South America.  We are also evaluating additional geographic expansion opportunities for the Monster Energy brand, Sacks added.

             At December 31, 2009 the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4 million.  The Company determined that an impairment of $12.1 million had occurred at December 31, 2009, of which $7.7 million was deemed temporary and $4.4 million was deemed other-than-temporary.  Included in other comprehensive loss is $4.6 million net of taxes for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2009.  Included in interest and other income, net is $3.9 million for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2009.  The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures
     Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales.  Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements.  However, gross sales are used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance.  Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers.
