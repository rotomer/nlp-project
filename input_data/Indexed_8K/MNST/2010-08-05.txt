 August 5, 2010  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record sales and profits for the three-months ended June 30, 2010.
Corona, CA
Gross sales for the 2010 second quarter increased 20.1 percent to $415.3 million from $345.8 million in the same period last year.  Net sales for the three-months ended June 30, 2010 increased 21.8 percent to $365.7 million from $300.2 million a year ago.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2010 second quarter was 52.9 percent, compared with 53.9 percent for the comparable 2009 second quarter.  Operating expenses for the 2010 second quarter increased to $83.7 million from $69.0 million in the same quarter last year.
     Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.3 percent for the 2010 second quarter, compared with 4.2 percent in the same quarter last year.
   
                Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.4 percent for the 2010 second quarter, compared with 11.2 percent in the same quarter a year ago.
                General and administrative expenses for the 2010 second quarter were $29.6 million, compared with $22.9 million for the corresponding quarter last year.  Stock-based compensation (a non-cash item) was $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with $3.7 million for the same period in 2009.
                Operating income for the 2010 second quarter increased 18.2 percent to $109.7 million from $92.8 million in the 2009 comparable quarter.
The effective tax rate for the 2010 second quarter was 42.0 percent compared with 38.5 percent in the same quarter last year.  The increased rate was primarily the result of a non-cash charge to establish a full valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to a foreign subsidiary, and its related impact on the Companys overall tax rate.
Net income for the 2010 second quarter increased 11.4 percent to $63.8 million, compared with $57.3 million in the same quarter last year.  Net income per diluted share increased 14.2 percent to $0.69, from $0.60 per diluted share in the 2009 comparable quarter.
Net sales for the Companys DSD segment for the 2010 second quarter increased 24.8 percent to $341.3 million from $273.5 million for the same period in 2009.  Net sales for the Companys warehouse segment were $24.4 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2010, compared with $26.8 million for the same period in 2009.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States rose to $66.6 million in the 2010 second quarter, from $39.4 million in the corresponding quarter in 2009.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record revenues to continued strong sales of Monster Energy drinks.  The Monster Energy brand continues to gain market share, with sales increasing in excess of category growth.  We remain encouraged with the performance of the Monster Energy brand, both in the United States and internationally, said Sacks.
During the second quarter we launched the Monster Energy brand in Slovakia, Czech Republic and Norway.  We are currently in the process of launching the brand in Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Jordan, with additional introductions anticipated for later in 2010.  We have introduced and are also planning to introduce additional new products this year both domestically and internationally, Sacks added.
For the first half of 2010 gross sales rose to $685.9 million from $624.7 million for the comparable period a year earlier.  Net sales for the first six months of 2010 increased to $603.8 million from $544.5 million in the same period last year.  Both gross and net sales for the 2010 first quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by customers in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter due to the Companys announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to the announcement of the transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing J anuary 1, 2010.  The Company previously estimated that approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of its fiscal 2009 fourth quarter gross sales were attributable to such advance purchases.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.6 percent for the first six months of 2010, compared with 53.6 percent for the same period in 2009.
Operating expenses for the six-months ended June 30, 2010, increased to $157.4 million from $133.4 million in the same period last year.  Operating income was $160.5 million, compared with $158.6 million in the first six months of 2009.
                Net income for the first half of 2010 was $96.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared with $98.9 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
Auction Rate Securities
In March 2010, the Company entered into an agreement relating to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities, which enables the Company to sell such securities (the Put Option) in semi-annual or annual installments beginning March 22, 2011 with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013.  Such auction rate securities, which have been reclassified from available-for-sale to trading securities, will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or by the terms outlined in their respective prospectuses in the event of auction failure.
At June 30, 2010 the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $87.3 million ($92.7 million at March 31, 2010) and the Put Option with a fair market value of $4.1 million ($5.1 million at March 31, 2010).  The Company determined that an impairment related to its auction rate securities of $6.5 million existed at June 30, 2010, of which $2.4 million was deemed temporary and $4.1 million was deemed other-than- temporary.  As a result, a loss of $1.4 million, net of taxes is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2010, and we recorded a net non-cash charge to earnings of $0.7 million in respect of our auction rate securities for the second qua rter of 2010.  The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures
   Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales.  Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements.  However, gross sales are used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance.  Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers.
