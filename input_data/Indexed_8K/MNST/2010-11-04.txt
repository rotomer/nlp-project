 Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record revenues to solid sales of Monster Energy drinks.  The Monster Energy brand continues to gain market share, with sales increasing in excess of category growth.  During the third quarter, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero and Monster Import Light to address increased consumer demand for lower and zero calorie beverages, Sacks said.  We continued to make progress on the international front during the third quarter and launched the Monster Energy brand in Germany, Europes second largest energy drink market, and also in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Jordan and Tahiti.  We are in the process of launching the Monster Energy brand in Switzerland, Austria and Iceland and are planning to launch Monster Energy in Bulgaria before the end of the year, he added.
& #160;  
 For the nine-months ended September 30, 2010, gross sales increased 14.8 percent to $1.124 billion from $979.7 million a year earlier.  Net sales for the first nine months of 2010 increased 15.6 percent to $985.3 million from $852.4 million .  Both gross and net sales for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and the 2010 first quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by customers in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter due to the Companys announcement of a new per case marketing contribut ion program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to the announcement of the transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system which commenced January 1, 2010.  The Company previously estimated that approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of its fiscal 2009 fourth quarter gross sales were attributable to such advance purchases.

Auction Rate Securities
  
   
In March 2010, the Company entered into an agreement relating to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities, which enables the Company to sell such securities (the Put Option) in semi-annual or annual installments beginning March 22, 2011 with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013.  Such auction rate securities, which have been reclassified from available-for-sale to trading securities, will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through either the Put Option, by the auction process, or by the terms outlined in their respective prospectuses in the event of auction failure.
 At September 30, 2010 the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $81.5 million ($87.3 million at June 30, 2010 and $92.7 million at March 31, 2010) and the Put Option with a fair market value of $3.8 million ($4.1 million at June 30, 2010 and $5.1 million at March 31, 2010).  The Company determined that an impairment related to its auction rate securities of $7.2 million existed at September 30, 2010, of which $2.2 million was deemed temporary and $5.0 million was deemed other-than-temporary.  As a result, a loss of $1.2 million, net of taxes, is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 30, 2010, and the Company recorded a net non-cash charge to earnings of $0.7 million in respect of our auction rate securities and Put Option for the third quarter of 2010.  The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales.  Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements.  However, gross sales are used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines a nd our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance.  Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers.
