 February 24, 2011  Hansen Natural Corporation (NASDAQ:HANS) today reported record financial results for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2010.
Corona, CA
Gross sales for the 2010 fourth quarter increased 10.5 percent to $364.1 million from $329.6 million a year earlier. Net sales for the 2010 fourth quarter increased 9.5 percent to $318.7 million from $290.9 million in the same quarter last year.  Both gross and net sales for the 2009 fourth quarter were positively impacted by advance purchases made by customers due to the Companys announcement in the fourth quarter of 2009 of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our planned transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system from January 1, 2010.  The Company previously estimated that approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of our fiscal 2009 fourth quarter gross sal es were attributable to such advance purchases.
     Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.6 percent for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared with 53.4 percent for the comparable 2009 quarter, in part due to increased promotional allowances, production variances and product mix.
   
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with 4.1 percent in the same quarter last year.
               Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2010 fourth quarter were 12.2 percent, compared with 10.4 percent in the same quarter a year ago primarily due to increased expenses to further promote the Monster Energy brand in existing markets, as well as to increase awareness and to establish the brand in new international markets.

Operating expenses for the 2010 fourth quarter increased to $84.6 million from $69.4 million in the same quarter last year.

 from 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States rose to $66.4 million in the 2010 fourth quarter, compared with $43.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2009.
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record revenues to continuing strong demand for Monster Energy drinks as well as to continued strength of the energy category. Monster Energy drinks continued to gain market share in the US, with sales increasing in excess of category growth. Sacks said that good progress was made on the international front during the quarter, with sales of Monster Energy drinks increasing well over comparable sales in the same quarter last year.  During the fourth quarter, we continued to invest in our Monster Energy brand, both domestically and overseas, Sacks said. In the US, we also launched Monster Energy M3 Super Concentrate, which is packaged in 5-oz glass bottles and Worx Ene rgy energy shots, which is packaged in 2-oz PET plastic bottles. The launch of Worx Energy energy shots is being supported with traditional television advertising, Sacks said. Plans are proceeding for the launch of our new non carbonated Monster Rehab energy drink with electrolytes and additional supplements in March 2011, Sacks added.
For the 2010 fiscal year, gross sales increased 13.7 percent to $1.489 billion from $1.309 billion .  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 14.1 percent to $1.304 billion from $1.143 billion .
