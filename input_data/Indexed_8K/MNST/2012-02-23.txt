Corona, CA
 February 23, 2012  Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) (the "Company") today reported record sales and profits for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2011.
 
Gross sales for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 28.4 percent to $467.3 million from $364.1 million in the same period last year.  Net sales for the three-months ended December 31, 2011 increased 28.7 percent to $410.0 million from $318.7 million a year ago.
 
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2011 fourth quarter was 52.3 percent, compared with 51.6 percent for the comparable 2010 quarter.  Operating expenses for the 2011 fourth quarter increased to $110.8 million from $84.6 million in the same quarter last year.
 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.4 percent for the 2011 fourth quarter, compared with 4.2 percent in the same quarter last year.
 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2011 fourth quarter were 12.5 percent, compared with 12.2 percent in the same quarter a year ago.
 
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2011 fourth quarter were 10.1 percent, compared with 10.2 percent for the corresponding quarter last year.  Stock-based compensation (a non-cash item) was $6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 29.6 percent to $103.4 million from $79.8 million in the comparable 2010 quarter.
The effective tax rate for the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3 percent, compared with 38.7 percent in the same quarter last year.
 
Net income for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 31.4 percent to $64.5 million from $49.1 million in the same quarter last year.  Net income per diluted share increased 32.6 percent to $0.35 from $0.26 per diluted share in the 2010 comparable quarter.

Gross sales to customers outside the United States rose to $88.9 million in the 2011 fourth quarter, compared with $66.4 million in the corresponding quarter in 2010.
 
During the 2011 fourth quarter, the Company purchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010.  These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program.
 
Rodney C. Sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that the energy drink category is continuing to demonstrate solid growth.  Once again, the Monster Energy brand grew in excess of the category and increased market share. "Our new Monster Rehab tea + lemonade rehydration energy drink with electrolytes, which was launched in the first quarter of 2011, continues to gain traction and has become one of our top selling Monster Energy products.  During the fourth quarter, we launched three new product extensions in the Monster Rehab line," Sacks said.  "We are continuing to expand into new international markets, with additional launches in 2012.  We commenced sales of the Monster Energy brand in Poland earlier this month," Sacks added.
 
For the 2011 fiscal year, gross sales increased 31.0 percent to $1.950 billion from $1.489 billion a year earlier.  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 30.6 percent to $1.703 billion from $1.304 billion a year ago.  Both gross and net sales for 2010 were impacted by advance purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter, following the Company's announcement of a new marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors, as well as to avoid product supply interruptions due to the Company's planned transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system in January 2010.  The Company previously estimated that approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of its fiscal 2009 fourth quarter gross sales were attributable to such advance purchases.
 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.5 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with 52.2 percent a year earlier.
 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2011 year increased to 25.7 percent or $437.9 million from 25.5 percent or $332.4 million for 2010.  Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 31.2 percent to $456.4 million from $347.8 million a year ago.
 
Net income for the twelve months of 2011 increased by 35.0 percent to $286.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, compared with $212.0 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for 2010.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.
 
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements made in this announcement may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to our future operating results and other future events including revenues and profitability.  Management cautions that these statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain
risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the control of the Company, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein.  Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the current uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy; changes in consumer preferences; changes in demand due to both domestic and international economic conditions; activities and strategies of competitors, including the introduction of new products and competitive pricing and/or marketing of similar products; potential distribution disruptions and/or decline in sales arising out of the termination and/or appointment of domestic and/or international distributors; changes in the price and/or availability of raw materials; other supply issues, including the availability of products and/or suitable production facilities; product distribution and placement decisions by retailers; changes in governmental regulation; the imposition of new and/or increased taxes on our products; political, legislative or other governmental actions or events in one or more regions in which we operate.  For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could affect our operating results, see the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
