Item 5. Other Events. On May 30, 2002, Philip Morris Companies Inc. issued the following press release: Contact: Laurie Guzzinati (917) 663-2144 PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO MERGE MILLER BREWING COMPANY INTO SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES plc SABMiller plc to Become World's Second-Largest Brewer Philip Morris Companies Inc. to Hold 36% of SABMiller plc And to Accelerate Share Repurchase Program New York - May 30, 2002 - Philip Morris Companies Inc. (NYSE:MO) announced an agreement with South African Breweries plc (LSE:SAB) to merge Miller Brewing Company into South African Breweries plc to form the world's second-largest brewer, with pro forma revenues of $9.3 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002. The transaction, with an implied value of approximately $5.6 billion, including $3.6 billion in stock and $2.0 billion in Miller Brewing Company debt, is expected to close in July, subject to customary regulatory review and South African Breweries plc shareholder approval. Upon closing, South African Breweries plc will change its name to SABMiller plc (SABMiller). The assumption of Miller Brewing Company's debt will result in cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion for Philip Morris Companies Inc. (Philip Morris), which will be used to accelerate its share repurchase program in 2002. SABMiller, which would have generated pro forma earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) of $1.2 billion on pro forma beer sales volume of 120 million hectoliters (102 million barrels) for the year ended March 31, 2002, will continue to be headquartered in London. Graham Mackay, current chief executive of South African
Breweries plc, will lead the enlarged group as chief executive. John D. Bowlin, current president and chief executive officer of Miller Brewing Company, will be responsible for SABMiller's businesses in the Americas and will report to Mr. Mackay. Louis C. Camilleri, president and chief executive officer of Philip Morris, said: "We are delighted with today's announced transaction, which is strategically compelling and is in the best interest of our shareholders. SABMiller will immediately become the world's second-largest brewer, with arguably the best geographic footprint among all global brewers. The enlarged group will have the ambition, as well as the financial and managerial capability, to become the world's leading brewer." Graham Mackay, chief executive of South African Breweries plc, said: "The transaction represents a new chapter in our development, taking SABMiller to the number two position globally, and positioning it to be a major participant in the on-going consolidation of the global beer industry. The transaction will provide access for South African Breweries plc and its shareholders to a significant position in the U.S. market, which enjoys the brewing industry's largest profit pool. Furthermore, it will enhance South African Breweries plc's international brand portfolio." John D. Bowlin, president and chief executive officer of Miller Brewing Company, added: "Everyone wins through this dynamic combination, including Miller's employees, customers and distributors. We are combining two great brewers with distinct, yet complementary assets and talents, with the promise to become greater than the sum of its parts. Miller Brewing Company is a great American brewer that will now become part of an exciting, global brewing enterprise with significant growth opportunities around the world." Highlights of the Merger Philip Morris will receive 430,000,000 shares in SABMiller, representing a 36% economic interest in the enlarged group prior to an intended equity placing by SABMiller. Philip Morris' total voting interest will be 24.99% of the votes exercisable at a general meeting. The implied value of the transaction is approximately $5.6 billion, based on a closing price of 5.76 British pounds per share for South African Breweries plc on May 29, 2002 2
and an exchange rate of 1.462 U.S. dollars per British pound, and the assumption of Miller Brewing Company's debt of $2.0 billion. It is the intention of Philip Morris to be a long-term shareholder in SABMiller. Accordingly, Philip Morris has agreed not to dispose of any shares until June 30, 2005 and not to purchase any further interest until December 31, 2004, subject to certain exceptions. At closing, Philip Morris will have three seats on the SABMiller Board of Directors. Growth Prospects for SABMiller At closing, SABMiller will be the world's second-largest brewer with leading positions in Central and Eastern Europe, North America, Central America, China and Africa, and will be well positioned for growth in the global beer industry. In addition, SABMiller will benefit from the combination of global scale, a strong management team, a diverse and balanced earnings base, a broad portfolio of leading brands and a powerful distribution infrastructure. These advantages will position SABMiller at the forefront of the consolidating brewing industry. The merger provides SABMiller with a significant position in the largest and most profitable beer market in the world -- the United States -- and the company will be well positioned in the three key growth segments in the United States beer market -- light beers, imports and flavored malt beverages. Impact on Philip Morris For Philip Morris, the combination of the transaction and the accelerated share repurchase program is expected to be essentially neutral to underlying diluted earnings per share in 2002 and 2003, and marginally accretive in subsequent years. The company said that it is maintaining its previously announced projection for growth in underlying diluted earnings per share in the range of 9% to 11% for the full-year 2002. In addition, based on current estimated share prices, the merger will result in a one-time gain of approximately $3.0 billion pre-tax and approximately $2.0 billion after-tax, which is expected to be recognized in Philip Morris' 2002 third-quarter reported results. 3
