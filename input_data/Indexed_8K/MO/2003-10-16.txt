EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK, October 16, 2003  Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) today announced third-quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share of $1.22, versus $2.06 for the same period a year ago, which included a gain of $0.81 per share for the Miller Brewing Co. transaction.
 
"We had a solid quarter that met our earnings target," said Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive officer of Altria Group, Inc. "Our domestic tobacco business sustained its recovery with stable volumes and improved retail market share. Our international tobacco business recorded strong income growth despite volume issues in Italy, France and Germany. Actions are in place to address our performance in these important markets. Finally, our worldwide food business results reflected a particularly
challenging quarter and the impact of our previously announced reinvestment program to narrow price gaps and enhance brand equity in several key categories."
 
"We remain confident that our investments across all our businesses will bear fruit in the years to come," Mr. Camilleri said. Altria Group, Inc. reaffirmed its projection of 2003 full-year diluted earnings per share in a range of $4.50 to $4.60, including $0.08 of incurred and projected charges for the tobacco growers settlement and relocation of Philip Morris USA's headquarters. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.
 
A conference call with members of the investment community will be Webcast at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on October 16, 2003.Access is available at .

As described in "Note 14. Segment Reporting" of Altria Group, Inc.'s 2002 Annual Report, management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings contained in this release.
 
2003 Third-Quarter Results
 
Net revenues for the third quarter of 2003, as detailed in the attached schedule entitled "Selected Financial Data by Business Segment," increased 4.7% versus 2002 to $20.9 billion, due primarily to favorable currency of $940 million and to increases from the international tobacco and food businesses, partially offset by lower net revenues from the domestic tobacco business.
 
Operating income decreased 7.3% to $4.2 billion, due primarily to lower operating income of $344 million from the domestic tobacco business and $180 million from food, partially offset by higher operating results from international tobacco. Also affecting operating income comparisons were favorable currency of $177 million; a $23
 
million gain due to the divestiture of an international food business; charges related to Philip Morris USA's headquarters relocation of $27 million; and asset impairment and exit costs in the international tobacco and food segments in both periods.
 
Net earnings decreased 42.9% to $2.5 billion, due primarily to the after-tax impact of the Miller transaction of $1.7 billion, or $0.81 per share, that was recorded during the third quarter of 2002. The effective tax rate decreased from the first-half rate of 35.2% to 34.5% in the third quarter, due primarily to favorable rulings affecting Altria's state taxes.
 
During the third quarter, Altria Group, Inc. raised its dividend 6.3% to an annualized rate of $2.72 per common share, marking the 36
th
time in 34 years that the dividend has been increased.

2003 Third-Quarter Results
 
Operating companies income for Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI), Altria Group, Inc.'s international tobacco business, rose 12.9% versus the same period a year ago to $1.7 billion, due to favorable currency of $150 million, volume gains, higher pricing and 2002 charges of $33 million for asset impairment and exit costs.
 
Shipment volume increased 0.8% to 189.4 billion units, as declines in Germany, Italy and France largely offset gains in other markets and volume of approximately one
 
billion units from an acquisition in Serbia. Volume comparisons benefited from a double-digit decline in Japan for the third quarter of 2002, due to the timing of shipments to that market caused by the shutdown of U.S. West Coast shipping ports, which was partially offset by a trade inventory reduction following the July 2003 price increase.
 
PMI achieved widespread market share gains, including increases in the key markets of Argentina, Austria, France, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom.
 
Total shipments were down 3% in the third quarter, due primarily to declines in France, Germany and Italy. However, share increased in Japan and other key income markets, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Mexico, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Poland, Portugal, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom.

In Western Europe, shipment volume declined 7.5%, due to a confluence of adverse industry dynamics in Germany, Italy and France, partially offset by increases in Spain and the United Kingdom. In Germany, volume declined 7.3%, reflecting a total market decline and consumer down trading to low-priced tobacco portions, which are benefiting from a discriminatory excise tax structure. PMI has filed unfair competition claims against the principal manufacturers of these products and, in addition, the European Union has challenged the legality of such excise tax treatment. PMI's share in Germany was down 0.2 points to 36.7%, reflecting increased trade inventories by competitors. In Italy, volume was down 19.3% while share fell 8.1 points to 53.1%, as and remained under pressure from low-priced competitive brands. As a result of the growth of this segment, the Italian government has suffered a significant loss in revenue and can be expected to take appropriate action. In France, shipment volume was down 6.7%, due to a lower total market as a result of tax-driven price increases. However, PMI's share was up 0.5 points to 39.1% in the quarter. Excise tax increases effective this month will continue impacting total market size going forward. However, the percent price gap between and low-priced brands is likely to be further decreased, to approximately 13%. In Spain, volume was up a strong 14.2% as and grew rapidly. Overall, PMI's share in Western Europe was down 1.1 points to 38.9%, but excluding Italy was up 0.3 points to 35.6%.

In Central Europe, volume decreased 1.3%, as declines from intense price competition in Lithuania, Poland and the Slovak Republic were partially offset by gains
 
in other Baltic countries, Greece and Serbia, with the latter also benefiting from acquisition volume. During the third quarter, PMI acquired a controlling interest in Duvanska Industrija Nis (DIN), a formerly state-owned cigarette company in Serbia. In early October, PMI announced that it had been given clearance by the European Commission for the acquisition of the Greek cigarette company Papastratos, and that it is proceeding with the purchase.

Yesterday, Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) reported third-quarter 2003 results. Kraft's worldwide volume decreased 0.2%, partially reflecting the impact of divestitures. Volume growth from ongoing businesses, which excludes the impact of businesses sold, was 1.0%, driven by tack on acquisitions, which accounted for 0.6 percentage points of
 
growth, solid growth in several North American businesses, and broad strength across the Asia Pacific region. Volume was lower in U.S. cookies, and European coffee and chocolate, due to significant softness in these categories. Operating income decreased $150 million, or 9.6%, to $1.4 billion, driven by higher commodity and benefit costs, the previously announced investment spending in focus categories (cheese, coffee, cold cuts and biscuits) and unfavorable mix, marginally offset by a gain on sale of the European rice business and the effects of favorable currency.
 
 
2003 Third-Quarter Results
 
Volume for Kraft Foods North America, Inc. (KFNA) increased 0.9%. Excluding the impact of a small, divested confectionery business, volume grew 1.0%, driven by strength in ready-to-drink beverages, foodservice, enhancers and meats, partially offset by consumption weakness in select categories, particularly cookies. Operating companies income decreased 11.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by higher commodity and benefit costs, investment spending in North American focus categories and unfavorable mix.
 
 
2003 Third-Quarter Results
 
Volume for Kraft Foods International, Inc. (KFI) decreased 3.2%, driven by the impact of divestitures. Volume from ongoing businesses increased 0.8%, as a 2.5 percentage point impact from acquisitions was largely offset by the adverse impact of the summer heat wave across Europe on the chocolate and coffee categories, and price competition. Operating companies income increased 2.3% to $307 million, as the effects of currency favorability of $18 million, a gain on sale of the European rice business of $23 million and higher pricing were partly offset by unfavorable mix, higher benefit costs and infrastructure investment in developing markets.
 
 
2003 Third-Quarter Results
 
Operating companies income for Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) decreased 7.3% to $76 million, driven by lower lease portfolio revenues, partially offset by higher asset management gains due primarily to the sale of six single-investor leases. Earlier in 2003, PMCC announced that it was shifting its strategic focus from an emphasis on the growth of its portfolio of finance leases through new lease investments to one of maximizing investment gains and generating cash flow from its diversified portfolio of leased assets.
