Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Nicholas M. Rolli (917) 663-3460 Timothy R. Kellogg (917) 663-2759 Altria Group, Inc. Reports 2004 First-Quarter Results; 2004 First-Quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.07 Versus $1.07 in Year-Ago Quarter Comparison Affected by Charges of $0.09 in First-Quarter 2004, As Detailed in Attached Reconciliation NEW YORK, April 20, 2004-- Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) today announced first-quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share of $1.07, including $0.09 in charges for the previously announced food restructuring and other items as described in the attached reconciliation of first-quarter 2003 to first-quarter 2004 results. Altria's reported diluted earnings per share of $1.07 in the first quarter a year ago contained no charges. "All in all, we had a solid first quarter that met our expectations," said Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive officer of Altria Group, Inc. "Results were very strong for our domestic tobacco business, which reported good income growth and retail share gains, especially for Marlboro and Parliament. Our international tobacco business posted solid income growth aided by currency, and volume and share gains in key markets around the world, but experienced continued weakness in France and Italy, which moderated total volume growth. Kraft's results were in line with expectations as it implemented the first phase of its restructuring program and invested in brand building initiatives." Altria Group, Inc. reaffirmed its previously announced projection for 2004 full-year diluted earnings per share in a range of $4.57 to $4.67, which includes a $0.23 reduction for anticipated charges related to the Kraft restructuring program announced in January and other items, but does not include potential charges for the international tobacco agreement under discussion with the European Commission. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection. On April 3, 2004, Philip Morris International (PMI), Altria Group, Inc.'s international tobacco business, announced that it is in discussions to reach an agreement with the European Commission that provides for broad cooperation with European law enforcement agencies on anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit efforts. The draft agreement would also resolve past disputes relating to these issues. Under the draft agreement, PMI would make 13 payments over 12 years and would record a pre-tax charge of $250 million for the initial payment when the agreement is signed. The draft agreement calls for base payments of $150 million on the first anniversary of the agreement, $100 million on the second anniversary and $75 million each year thereafter for 10 years, each of which is to be adjusted based on certain variables, including PMI's market share in the EU in the year preceding payment. PMI would record these base payments as an expense in cost of sales when product is shipped. A conference call with members of the investment community will be Webcast at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on April 20, 2004. Access is available at www.altria.com. ALTRIA GROUP, INC. As described in "Note 14. Segment Reporting" of Altria Group, Inc.'s 2003 Annual Report, management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings contained in this release. 2004 First-Quarter Results Net revenues for the first quarter 2004, as detailed in the attached schedule entitled "Selected Financial Data by Business Segment," increased 12.7% versus the first quarter 2003 to $21.8 billion, due primarily to increases from Altria's domestic and international tobacco businesses, favorable currency of $1.3 billion and an increase from North American food. Operating income decreased 3.5% to $3.7 billion, due primarily to the impact of the food restructuring charges and lower income from food, partially offset by higher income from domestic tobacco. Also affecting operating income comparisons were favorable currency of $278 million and the other items described in the attached reconciliation of first-quarter 2003 operating companies income to first-quarter 2004 operating companies income. Net earnings increased 0.4% to $2.2 billion, due primarily to higher income from domestic tobacco, favorable currency and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by food restructuring charges and lower income from food. The effective tax rate decreased from 35.2% in the first quarter of 2003 to 34.6% in the first quarter of 2004. During the first quarter of 2004, Altria Group, Inc. declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per common share, which represents an annualized rate of $2.72 per common share. DOMESTIC TOBACCO 2004 First-Quarter Results Philip Morris USA Inc., Altria Group, Inc.'s domestic tobacco business, delivered robust market share performance, with total retail share growing 1.3 share points to 49.6%, driven by Marlboro's strong performance. Philip Morris USA's shipment volume decreased 1.7% to 43.1 billion units, but was essentially flat when adjusted for the timing of promotions, wholesaler inventory changes and one extra shipping day in the first quarter of 2004. Premium mix for Philip Morris USA improved by approximately 0.2 share points to 91.3%. Operating companies income increased 30.7%, to $970 million, due to the absence of one-time buy-down costs incurred in the first quarter of 2003, lower returned goods expenses and lower cash discounts paid to the trade, partially offset by lower volume and pre-tax charges of $11 million for the move of Philip Morris USA's headquarters to Richmond, VA and other exit costs. The increase in Philip Morris USA's total retail share to 49.6% in the first quarter of 2004 was driven by a 1.5 share point gain in Marlboro. Marlboro Menthol 72mm, a premium-priced addition to the Marlboro Menthol family, was launched nationally at retail in March and met its initial share and distribution objectives. Parliament recorded a 0.2 share point gain, while retail share was unchanged for Basic and down slightly for Virginia Slims, as shown in the following table: Philip Morris USA Quarterly Retail Share* Q1 2004 Q1 2003 Change ----------- ----------- ----------- Marlboro 39.0% 37.5% + 1.5 pp Parliament 1.7% 1.5% + 0.2 pp Virginia Slims 2.4% 2.5% - 0.1 pp Basic 4.3% 4.3% 0.0 pp ----------- ----------- ----------- Focus Brands 47.4% 45.8% + 1.6 pp Other Philip Morris USA 2.2% 2.5% - 0.3 pp ----------- ----------- ----------- Total Philip Morris USA 49.6% 48.3% + 1.3 pp * IRI/Capstone Total Retail Panel data Philip Morris USA's retail share of the premium segment increased 0.8 share points to 61.8% in the first quarter of 2004, while its share of the discount segment increased 0.4 share points to 16.1%. INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO 2004 First-Quarter Results Shipment volume for Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI), Altria Group, Inc.'s international tobacco business, increased 3.2% to 196.9 billion units in the first quarter of 2004. Gains in key markets and additional volume from 2003 acquisitions were partially offset by declines primarily in France and Italy. Excluding acquisition volume, shipments of 190.8 billion units were the same in the first quarter of 2004 as the first quarter of 2003. Operating companies income for PMI rose 8.6% to $1.8 billion for the first quarter due to favorable currency of $243 million, the impact of acquisitions and higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume in the higher margin markets of Western Europe and investments in marketing, distribution and infrastructure. During the first quarter of 2004, PMI achieved widespread market share gains, including increases in the top income markets of Argentina, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Total Marlboro shipments were down 3.0% in the first quarter of 2004 versus the first quarter of 2003, due primarily to declines in France and Italy. However, Marlboro volume was higher in many markets, most notably in Argentina, Brazil, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia and the Ukraine. Share gains for Marlboro were achieved in the key markets of Argentina, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Spain, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom. In Western Europe, shipment volume decreased 10.6% for the first quarter of 2004, due to an unfavorable comparison with the first quarter of 2003, when the full effects of tax-driven price increases in France and low-price competition in Italy had not yet fully impacted results. In France, shipment volume was down 31.0%, reflecting an overall market decline and trade inventory reductions. However, PMI's share in France was stable at 39.2% during the first quarter. In Italy, volume was down 14.6% and share declined 3.9 points to 51.8%. Marlboro and Diana were adversely impacted in Italy by low-priced competitive brands, trade purchasing patterns around price increases in the first quarter of 2004 and a lower total market. In Germany, volume declined 3.0%, primarily reflecting a lower total cigarette market mainly due to continued shifts to low-priced tobacco portions. PMI will enter the tobacco portions segment under the Marlboro and Next brands later this month. Share in Germany was up slightly to 37.3% during the first quarter of 2004. In Spain, share increased 1.8 share points to 37.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro and Chesterfield. Total market share in Western Europe declined 0.6 share points to 38.6% in the first quarter of 2004, but was up slightly excluding Italy. In Central Europe, volume increased 18.4%, due mainly to gains in Greece and Serbia, which benefited from the impact of acquisitions and an increase in the Czech Republic. These gains were partially offset by a decline in Poland due to intense price competition, as well as down trading to roll-your-own cigarettes. In worldwide duty-free, volume increased a strong 14.2%, reflecting increased travel and strong performance in Turkey, Romania, Asia and the Middle East. In Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, volume grew 9.3%, due primarily to Russia, Turkey and the Ukraine. In Russia, market share was up 2.1 share points to 26.1%, fueled by L&M, Next and Chesterfield. In Turkey, share grew 3.8 points to 34.1% due to the continued strong performance of L&M and the successful July 2003 launch of Muratti. In Asia, volume advanced 6.0%, reflecting significant investments made by PMI in major markets. In Korea, volume increased 35.0%, benefiting from the growth of Lark and newly introduced Marlboro Ultra Lights. Strong volume increases in Malaysia and Thailand were aided by the growth of Marlboro and L&M, respectively. In the Philippines, volume increased 35.8%, driven by Marlboro and the acquisition of the Sterling brands. These increases were partially offset by declines in Indonesia and Japan. In Japan, the total market was down 3.4% due to the adverse impact of the July 2003 tax-driven retail price increase and a lower incidence of smoking. However, PMI's share in Japan was up 0.2 share points to 24.2% due to Marlboro. In Latin America, volume rose 2.5%, driven by gains in Brazil and Mexico. In Brazil, volume and share were up due to Marlboro. In Mexico, PMI's share rose 1.4 share points to 59.1%, due mainly to Marlboro's strong performance and the launch of B&H Lights Menthol late last year. In Argentina, Marlboro drove a 0.3 share point increase to 66.5% market share. FOOD Yesterday, Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) reported 2004 first-quarter results. Kraft's worldwide total reported volume was up 0.5%, due to ongoing volume growth of 0.8%, partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Volume strength across many businesses was partially offset by continued challenges in cookies and cereals, including the low carbohydrate diet phenomenon; by trade inventory reductions in certain categories and countries; and by tough comparisons with last year, when new product activity was skewed to the first quarter. Operating income declined 33.5% to $989 million, as exit costs associated with the previously announced restructuring program, higher commodity and benefit costs, increased marketing investment and an intangible asset impairment charge were partially offset by favorable currency and top line growth. In March, Kraft announced the acquisition of Veryfine Products Inc., the privately held manufacturer of Fruit2O flavored water and Veryfine juices and juice drinks, with 2003 net sales of approximately $140 million. In early April, Kraft announced a licensing agreement with Tazo Tea Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Starbucks Corporation, under which Kraft will market, sell and distribute Tazo products across the entire U.S. grocery channel. NORTH AMERICAN FOOD 2004 First-Quarter Results For the first quarter of 2004, volume for Kraft North America Commercial (KNAC), formerly Kraft Foods North America, Inc., grew 1.0% due to broad-based growth with strength in foodservice, cheese, snack nuts, meats, desserts and enhancers, partially offset by weakness in cookies and cereal, as well as new product timing and trade inventory reductions on ready-to-drink beverages. Operating companies income declined 33.5% to $846 million due to exit costs for the restructuring program of $245 million, higher commodity and benefit costs, increased marketing investment, and an intangible asset impairment charge of $17 million, partially offset by the contribution from volume growth and favorable currency of $11 million. INTERNATIONAL FOOD 2004 First-Quarter Results For the first quarter of 2004, volume for Kraft International Commercial (KIC), formerly Kraft Foods International, Inc., decreased 0.9%, as the impact of divested businesses more than offset ongoing volume growth of 0.4%. Ongoing volume growth was driven by acquisitions and growth in the United Kingdom and Germany, partially offset by declines in France and Puerto Rico, due to aggressive price competition, and in Russia due to trade inventory reductions. Other key developing markets, such as China, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, all recorded solid volume increases in the quarter. Operating companies income decreased 26.8% to $191 million, as exit costs for the restructuring program of $34 million, lower margins, higher benefit costs, infrastructure investment in developing markets, and an intangible asset impairment charge of $12 million were partially offset by favorable currency of $24 million. FINANCIAL SERVICES 2004 First-Quarter Results Operating companies income for Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) decreased 15.7% to $70 million for the first quarter of 2004, driven by lower lease portfolio revenues as a result of PMCC's shift in strategic direction announced in 2003.
