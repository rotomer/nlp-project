On January 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Altria Group, Inc. approved the grant of shares of restricted stock pursuant to the 2000 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to the executive officers named in the 2004 Proxy Statement (the "Named Executive Officers"), other than Roger K. Deromedi, in the amounts indicated below:
Restricted Stock.
 
 
The restricted stock awards vest three years from the grant date. A form of restricted stock agreement is attached as an Exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
On January 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved base salaries, effective May 1, 2005, for the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Deromedi, in the amounts indicated below:

On January 26, 2005, pursuant to the Plan, the Compensation Committee approved annual incentive awards for 2004, payable in cash, to the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Deromedi, as follows:
Annual Incentive Awards.
 
 
In addition, on January 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved a formula for determining the maximum award amounts for 2005 annual incentive awards, which formula reflects the Company's intention to qualify, to the extent possible, cash compensation paid to officers as tax-deductible, subject to the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
The maximum award amounts for the 2005 annual incentive awards will be determined based on a performance incentive pool equal to 0.25% of the adjusted net earnings of Altria Group, Inc. Adjusted net earnings of Altria Group, Inc. is defined as the net earnings before extraordinary items, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding certain other items designated by the Compensation Committee. In addition, individual award amounts are limited to the shareholder-approved maximum defined in the Plan of $10.0 million.
 
At the conclusion of 2005, the performance incentive pool for the 2005 annual incentive awards will be calculated and divided among the covered officers. The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer's maximum award is equal to one-third of the pool and the remaining two-thirds of the pool will be allocated equally among the remaining covered officers, subject in each instance, to the maximum individual award amount defined in the Plan.
 
Mr. Deromedi's compensation is subject to approval by the Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Kraft Foods Inc. On January 25, 2005, that committee approved a grant to Mr. Deromedi of 150,090 restricted shares of Kraft Foods Inc. common stock, a base salary of $1,200,000, effective April 1, 2005, and an annual incentive award for 2004 payable in cash of $1,800,000. Mr. Deromedi's restricted stock award vests three years from the grant. On January 25, 2005, the Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Kraft Foods Inc. also approved a formula for determining the maximum award amounts for 2005 annual incentive awards. The maximum award amounts will be determined based on a performance incentive pool equal to 0.4% of the adjusted net earnings of Kraft Foods Inc. Adjusted net earnings of Kraft Foods Inc. is defined as the net earnings before extraordinary items, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding certain other items designated by the Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Kraft Foods Inc. In addition, individual award amounts are limited to the shareholder-approved maximum defined in the Kraft Foods Inc. 2001 Performance Incentive Plan.
Mr. Deromedi.

Exhibit 10
 
 
 
ALTRIA GROUP, INC. (the "Company"), a Virginia corporation, hereby grants to the employee identified in the 2005 Restricted Stock Award section of the Award Statement (the "Employee") under The Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan") a Restricted Stock Award (the "Award") dated January 26, 2005, with respect to the number of shares set forth in the 2005 Restricted Stock Award section of the Award Statement (the "Shares") of the Common Stock of the Company (the "Common Stock"), all in accordance with and subject to the following terms and conditions:
 
1. . The Shares shall be evidenced by a book entry account maintained by the Company's Transfer Agent for the Common Stock. Upon the vesting of Shares, no certificates will be issued except upon a separate written request therefor made to such Transfer Agent or other agent as determined by the Company.
Book Entry Registration
 
2. . Subject to Section 3 below, the restrictions on the Shares shall lapse and the Shares shall vest on the Vesting Date set forth in the 2005 Restricted Stock Award section of the Award Statement (the "Vesting Date"), provided that the Employee remains an employee of the Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate) during the entire period (the "Restriction Period") commencing on the Award Date set forth in the Award Statement and ending on the Vesting Date.
Restrictions
 
3. . In the event of the termination of the Employee's employment with the Company (and with all subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company) prior to the Vesting Date due to death, or Disability, or upon the Employee reaching eligibility for Normal Retirement, the restrictions on the Shares shall lapse and the Shares shall become fully vested on the date of death, Disability, or Normal Retirement.
Termination of Employment During Restriction Period
 
If the Employee's employment with the Company (and with all subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company) is terminated for any reason other than death or Disability, prior to the end of the Restriction Period, the Employee shall forfeit all rights to the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its sole discretion, waive the restrictions on, and the vesting requirements for, the Shares.
 
4. . During the Restriction Period, the Employee shall have the rights to vote the Shares and to receive any cash dividends payable with respect to the Shares, as paid, less applicable withholding taxes (it being understood that such dividends will generally be taxable as ordinary compensation income during such Restriction Period).
Voting and Dividend Rights
 
5. . This Award and the Shares (until they become unrestricted pursuant to the terms hereof) are non-transferable and may not be assigned, hypothecated or otherwise pledged and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, the Award shall immediately become null and void and the Shares shall be forfeited.
Transfer Restrictions
 
6. . The Company is authorized to satisfy the actual minimum statutory withholding taxes arising from the granting or vesting of this Award, as the cases may be, by (i) deducting the number of shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of withholding taxes due from the total number of shares awarded or the number of shares vesting or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation; or (ii) deducting the required amounts from any proceeds realized by the Employee upon the open-market sale of vested Shares. Shares deducted from this Award in satisfaction of actual minimum withholding tax requirements shall be valued at the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date as of which the amount giving rise to the withholding requirement first became includible in the gross income of the Employee under applicable tax laws. If the Employee is covered by a Company tax equalization policy, the Employee also agrees to pay to the Company any additional tax obligation calculated and paid in accordance with such tax equalization policy.
Withholding Taxes
7. . If any of the Shares shall vest upon the death of the Employee, they shall be registered in the name of the estate of the Employee except that, to the extent permitted by the Compensation Committee, if the Company shall have theretofore received in writing a beneficiary designation, the Shares shall be registered in the name of the designated beneficiary.
Death of Employee
 
8. . The terms and provisions of the Plan (a copy of which will be furnished to the Employee upon written request to the Office of the Secretary, Altria Group, Inc., 120 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017) are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent any provision of this Award is inconsistent or in conflict with any term or provision of the Plan, the Plan shall govern. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term "Disability" means permanent and total disability as determined under procedures established by the Company for purposes of the Plan, and (b) the term "Normal Retirement" means retirement from active employment under a pension plan of the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate or under an employment contract with any of them on or after the date specified as the normal retirement age in the pension plan or employment contract, if any, under which the Employee is at that time accruing pension benefits for his or her current service (or, in the absence of a specified normal retirement age, the age at which pension benefits under such plan or contract become payable without reduction for early commencement and without any requirement of a particular period of prior service). In any case in which (i) the meaning of "Normal Retirement" is uncertain under the definition contained in the prior sentence or (ii) a termination of employment at or after age 65 would not otherwise constitute "Normal Retirement," an Employee's termination of employment shall be treated as a "Normal Retirement" under such circumstances as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equivalent to retirement. Generally, for purposes of this Agreement, (x) a "subsidiary" includes only any company in which the Company, directly or indirectly, has a beneficial ownership interest of greater than 50 percent and (y) an "affiliate" includes only any company that (A) has a beneficial ownership interest, directly or indirectly, in the Company of greater than 50 percent or (B) is under common control with the Company through a parent company that, directly or indirectly, has a beneficial ownership interest of greater than 50 percent in both the Company and the affiliate. In the event of any merger, share exchange, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, distribution, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, spin-off, issuance of rights or warrants or other similar transaction or event affecting the Common Stock after the date of this Award, the Board of Directors of the Company is authorized, to the extent it deems appropriate, to make adjustments to the number and kind of shares of stock subject to this Award, including the substitution of equity interests in other entities involved in such transactions, to provide for cash payments in lieu of restricted or unrestricted shares, and to determine whether continued employment with any entity resulting from such a transaction will or will not be treated as continued employment by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Other Terms and Provisions
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restricted Stock Agreement has been duly executed as of January 26, 2005.
