Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 31, 2006, Altria Group, Inc. ("Altria") entered into a senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit agreement (the "364-Day Agreement") with the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Citibank N.A., as administrative agents. The 364-Day Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and expires on March 30, 2007. Interest rates on borrowings under the new facility will be based on prevailing interest rates as described in the 364-Day Agreement.
The 364-Day Agreement replaces Altria's existing $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement, which was to expire on April 14, 2006. Altria's 5-year revolving credit agreement dated April 15, 2005 (the "5-Year Agreement" and, together with the 364-Day Agreement, the "Credit Agreements") will remain in place.
The 364-Day Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes and to support Altria's commercial paper issuances. The 364-Day Agreement requires the maintenance of an earnings to fixed charges ratio, as defined in the agreements, of not less than 2.5 to 1.
At March 31, 2006, Altria had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreements.
Some of the lenders under the agreements and their affiliates have various relationships with Altria and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking and trust services. In addition, Altria and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates.
The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the 364-Day Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information described above under "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is hereby incorporated by reference.

In the event that, after the date hereof, the implementation of or any change in any law or regulation, or any guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) or the interpretation or administration thereof by any central bank or other authority charged with the administration thereof, imposes, modifies or deems applicable any capital adequacy or similar requirement (including, without limitation, a request or requirement which affects the manner in which any Lender allocates capital resources to its commitments, including its obligations hereunder) and as a result thereof, in the sole opinion of such Lender, the rate of return on such Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder is reduced to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such circumstances, but reduced to the extent that Borrowings are outstanding from time to time, then in each such case, upon demand from time to time Altria shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as shall compensate such Lender for such reduction in rate of return; that, in the case of each Lender, such additional amount or amounts shall not exceed 0.15 of 1% per annum of such Lender's Commitment. A certificate of such Lender as to any such additional amount or amounts shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Except as provided below, in determining any such amount or amounts each Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lender shall take all reasonable actions to avoid the imposition of, or reduce the amounts of, such increased costs, provided that such actions, in the reasonable judgment of such
Reduction in Lender's Rate of Return

Lender, will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender, and, to the extent possible, each Lender will calculate such increased costs based upon the capital requirements for its Commitment hereunder and not upon the average or general capital requirements imposed upon such Lender.
          Section 2.13. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, that the introduction of or any change in, or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances or to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances, (a) each LIBO Rate Advance or Floating Rate Bid Advances, as the case may be, will automatically, upon such demand, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.04(a)(i), as the case may be, and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances or to Convert Base Rate Advances into LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended, in each case, until JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, shall notify Altria and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; , , that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances or to continue to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances, as the case may be, and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

Each determination by JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.05 by a Lender), of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
     (c) . Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; , , that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

     (d) . Unless JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, receives notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, on such date and JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower has not made such payment in full to JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

Taxes

non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder being hereinafter referred to as ""). If any Borrower or Altria shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) such Lender or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent (as the case may be), receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or Altria shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower or Altria shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent (as the case may be), makes written demand therefor.
     (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each Borrower and Altria shall furnish to JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. If any Borrower or Altria determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower or Altria shall, at the request of JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, furnish or cause the payor to furnish, JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, and each Lender an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.
     (e) Each Lender, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, shall provide each of JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, Altria and such Borrower with any form or certificate that is required by any taxing authority (including, if applicable, two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service), certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes on payments pursuant to this Agreement. Thereafter, each such Lender shall provide additional forms or certificates (i) to the extent a form or certificate previously provided has become inaccurate or invalid or has otherwise ceased to be effective or (ii) as requested in writing by any Borrower, Altria or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrowers, Altria and JPMorgan Chase,
 
as Administrative Agent, have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes or are subject to Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, such Borrower, Altria or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender.
     (f) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select or change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a selection or change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise economically disadvantageous to such Lender.
     (g) No additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 with respect to (i) any Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that would not have been payable had the Lender provided the relevant forms or other documents pursuant to Section 2.15(e); or (ii) in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance by a Lender to an Eligible Assignee, any Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that exceed the amount of such Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that are imposed prior to such Assignment and Acceptance, unless such Assignment and Acceptance resulted from the demand of Altria.
     (h) If any Lender or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, as the case may be, obtains a refund of any Tax for which payment has been made pursuant to this Section 2.15, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender or JPMorgan Chase, as Administrative Agent, as the case may be, (and without any obligation to disclose its tax records) is allocable to such payment made under this Section 2.15, the amount of such refund (together with any interest received thereon and reduced by reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such refund) promptly shall be paid to the Borrower to the extent payment has been made in full by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15.
          Section 2.16. . If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Pro Rata Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.15 or 9.04(b)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Pro Rata Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Pro Rata Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; , , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

As to questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established by us, relied upon the representations of Altria set forth in the Credit Agreement and upon certificates of Altria or its officers or of public officials. Whenever the phrase "to our knowledge" is used herein, it refers to the actual knowledge of the attorneys of the firm involved in the representation of Altria in connection with the Credit Agreement, without independent investigation. We have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial
 
Lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N. A., as Administrative Agent, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as Syndication Agents, and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., BNP Paribas, HSBC Bank USA, National Association and UBS Loan Finance LLC, as Arrangers and Documentation Agents.
     Our opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Federal law of the United States.
     Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the following opinion:
     1. Altria is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by Altria of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within Altria's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to Altria (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (iii) to our knowledge, any contractual restriction binding on or affecting Altria. The Credit Agreement and any Notes delivered on the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of Altria.
     3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by Altria of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
     4. The Credit Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Altria enforceable against Altria in accordance with its terms. The Notes issued on the date hereof, if any, are the legal, valid and binding obligations of Altria, enforceable against Altria in accordance with their respective terms.

     We express no opinion with respect to:
          (A) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement which is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing by the parties thereto;
          (B) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or
 
similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
          (C) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement imposing penalties or forfeitures;
          (D) The enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; or
          (E) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.
          In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement which relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that, under NYCPLR  510, a New York State court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and, under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action from one Federal court to another.

As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company. In addition,
 
we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the representations made in the Credit Agreement.

     In rendering the opinion set forth below we have assumed that (1) the Credit Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Lenders party thereto, (2) the Company is duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and of each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or ownership of its property makes such qualification necessary, has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and By-laws or other similar organizational documents, and (3)(a) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not contravene its Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or other similar organizational documents, (b) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not violate, or require any consent not obtained under, the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or any other applicable laws or regulations or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or other governmental authority binding on the Company, and (c) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not constitute a breach or violation of, or require any consent not obtained under, any agreement or instrument which is binding upon the Company.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
     Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
     We express no opinion with respect to:
          (A) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement which is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing by the parties thereto;
          (B) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
          (C) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement imposing penalties or forfeitures;
 
          (D) the enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; or
          (E) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.

          We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York and the Federal law of the United States.
          This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
