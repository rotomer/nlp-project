Exhibit 99.1
 
 
NEW YORK, April 20, 2006 - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) today announced first-quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.65, up 33.1% versus the corresponding prior year period, including $0.46 per share from a previously announced reversal of tax reserves following the conclusion of an IRS examination of Altrias consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999, and several other items, which are detailed on the attached Schedule 4.
Our first quarter results were impacted by a number of items in both 2006 and the year-ago period. Absent those items, our businesses achieved operating results that were in line with our expectations, said Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive officer of Altria Group, Inc.
Our domestic tobacco business delivered strong share and income gains in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the strength of the brand, Mr. Camilleri said. Our international tobacco business achieved solid volume and share gains in many markets, but as previously anticipated, income growth was adversely impacted by a combination of factors, including unfavorable currency movements, lower results in Spain and a difficult comparison to the prior year.

In our food business, Kraft continued to make progress against its long-term objectives, achieving both solid organic revenue growth and stronger results from operations. Although commodity costs and the European Union business remain challenging, Kraft expects its momentum to build in 2006.
2006 Full-Year Forecast
Altria Group reaffirmed its previously announced projection for 2006 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $5.25 to $5.35.
This forecast includes the $0.46 tax benefit recorded in this quarter, as well as approximately $0.36 per share in charges associated with the Kraft restructuring program for the full year, unfavorable currency of $0.14 per share, about $0.10 per share for lower tobacco income in Spain, $0.05 per share due to higher shares outstanding, a $0.05 per share negative impact from Krafts sale of the brand, which was announced on March 16, 2006, and $0.03 per share in charges related to an Italian antitrust action. It does not include the impact of any future potential acquisitions or divestitures. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection.

2006 First-Quarter Results
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2006 increased 3.1% versus 2005 to $24.4 billion, including $708 million from acquisitions offset by unfavorable currency of $749 million.
Operating income decreased 2.3% to $4.1 billion, reflecting the items described in the attached reconciliation on Schedule 3, including higher charges at Kraft for asset impairment and exit costs, unfavorable currency of $163 million and difficult comparisons with the first quarter of 2005 when Kraft benefited from gains on sales of businesses and Philip Morris International (PMI) recorded a $96 million benefit from the one-time sale of inventory to its new distributor in Italy. These were partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions of approximately $146 million, primarily Sampoerna.
Earnings from continuing operations increased 34.6% to $3.5 billion, reflecting the factors mentioned above and a significantly lower effective tax rate. The companys effective tax rate was 7.5% in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 33.1% for the same period in 2005, primarily reflecting the previously announced tax benefits recorded in the first quarter.
Net earnings, including discontinued operations, increased 33.9% to $3.5 billion, aided by the previously announced tax benefits of approximately $1.0 billion. Diluted earnings per share, including discontinued operations as detailed on Schedule 1, increased 32.0% to $1.65, driven by the factors mentioned above.
During the first quarter of 2006, Altria Group, Inc. declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.80 per common share, which represents an annualized rate of $3.20 per common share.

Shipment volume of 43.3 billion units was up 1.2% from the previous year, but was estimated to be essentially flat when adjusted for one more shipping day versus the first quarter of 2005. Premium mix for PM USA increased by 0.4 percentage points to 92.0% in the first quarter of 2006.
Operating companies income increased 7.5% to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by lower wholesale and retail promotional allowance rates and higher volume.
As shown in the following table, PM USAs total retail share increased to 50.4% in the first quarter of 2006, driven.

2006 First-Quarter Results
Cigarette shipment volume for Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI), Altria Group, Inc.s international tobacco business, increased 4.6% to 210.2 billion units. The favorable impact of acquisitions in Indonesia and Colombia, coupled with solid gains in Argentina, Egypt, France, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, were partially offset by declines in Japan (reflecting the prior-year inventory build-up in anticipation of the expiration of the license in April 2005), Spain (due to lower share and lower total consumption), worldwide duty-free (due to timing of shipments and lower travel allowances in Turkey) and the impact of the inventory sale to a new distributor in Italy during the first quarter of 2005. Excluding acquisitions, as well as the 2005 inventory sale in Italy and inventory build-up in Japan, PMIs cigarette shipment volume was essentially flat. PMIs total tobacco volume, which included 2.3 billion cigarette equivalent units of other tobacco products (OTPs), grew 5.0% to 212.5 billion units versus the same period last year.

Operating companies income was down 5.2% to $2.0 billion, due primarily to a negative currency impact of $156 million, a $61 million charge related to an Italian antitrust action, unfavorable volume and mix, higher R&D expenses, and a difficult comparison with 2005 when PMI recorded income of $96 million for the inventory sale in Italy. Partially offsetting the above factors were higher pricing and the favorable impact of acquisitions of $146 million.
PMIs market shares in the first quarter of 2006 advanced in many countries, with robust gains achieved by several top income markets including Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and Ukraine.
Total cigarette shipments of 80.5 billion were down 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2005, which benefited from the inventory sale in Italy and the inventory build-up in Japan. Absent those shipments were down 0.6%, due mainly to declines in Germany, Spain and worldwide duty-free, partially offset by gains in France, Japan, the Philippines and Russia. market shares grew in Australia, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Thailand and Ukraine.

In the European Union (EU) region, PMIs cigarette shipments declined 11.9%, but when adjusted to exclude the 2005 inventory sale in Italy, shipments were down 6.8% due largely to Spain. PMIs cigarette market share in the EU region was 39.4%, down 0.6 points as strong share performances in France, Germany and Italy were offset by declines in the Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal and Spain.
In Germany, the total consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products declined 2.6% and PMIs total tobacco shipments were up 3.1%. PMIs share of total tobacco consumption increased 1.1 points to 29.1%, representing sequential share growth for the second consecutive quarter. The total cigarette market declined 9.8%, while PMIs cigarette volume was down 6.5%, resulting in PMIs cigarette market share rising 0.7 points to 37.1%, driven by the recent price repositioning of , the growth of and the resilience of , attributable to the growth of Red. Total tobacco portions volume in the first quarter rose 26.2% to 6.5 billion units and PMIs share of tobacco portions rose 6.1 points to 19.1%. Late last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the German governments favorable tax treatment of tobacco portions was against EU law. Accordingly, tobacco portions manufactured as of April 1, 2006, now incur the same excise tax as that levied on cigarettes. Existing stocks of tobacco portions are expected to remain in the market through the third quarter of this year.

In Italy, the total cigarette market rose 3.6% versus a low base in the first quarter of 2005, when it was adversely impacted by the compounding effect of the January 2005 smoking ban and the December 2004 tax-driven price increase. PMIs reported shipment volume was down

In Spain, the total cigarette market was down 4.3%, primarily due to the impact of a new tobacco law implemented on January 1, 2006. PMIs shipments were 18.0% lower and share was down 4.1 points versus the prior year to 32.6%, attributable to declines in , and as a result of down-trading to the low-price segment. However, PMI achieved sequential share growth of 1.0 point in total, and its premium and mid-price brands ,and were up a combined 2.3 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail share for the low-price segment, which includes all brands priced at 2.00 euros or less per pack of 20 cigarettes, peaked at 31% in the fourth quarter of 2005, but declined to 29% in the first quarter of 2006. On February 11, 2006 the government introduced a minimum excise tax (MET) on cigarettes of 1.10 euros per pack, and further increased ad valorem and specific tax rates. While this action was partially effective, a number of competitive brands priced at 1.75 to 1.85 euros per pack still remain on the market. In this challenging environment, PMIs profitability was significantly below the prior-year level, due largely to the impact of higher excise taxes, lower volume and unfavorable mix.
