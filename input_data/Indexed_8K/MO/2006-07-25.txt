99.1 Altria Group, Inc. Earnings Press Release dated July 25, 2006 (furnished pursuant to Item 2.02).

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK, July 25, 2006 - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) today announced second-quarter 2006 reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.29, including items detailed on the attached Schedule 7, versus $1.40 in the year-ago period.
Our second quarter results were solid in all respects, and we are witnessing an improvement in underlying fundamentals across all our businesses. While the global economic outlook continues to be a source of concern, we look forward to continued momentum in the second half of the year, said Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive officer of Altria Group, Inc. Our domestic tobacco business continued to increase its market share, driven by gains for both
Marlboro
and
Parliament
. Our international tobacco business achieved strong share gains in France, Germany and Italy, and benefited from acquisitions. Our food business made continued progress, with good top-line growth and solid income performance.
 
 
Excluding items shown in the table below, 2006 second-quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6.8%.
 
As shown in the reconciliation on Schedule 7, the 7.9% decline in reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was due primarily to an unfavorable comparison with the year-ago period, which benefited from $0.11 per share in tax benefits, primarily related to the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), higher Kraft restructuring charges for the second quarter of 2006 versus 2005, and an increase in the allowance for losses related to the airline industry at Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC).
2006 Full-Year Forecast
 
Altria Group raised its previously announced projection for 2006 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from a range of $5.25 to $5.35 to a range of $5.40 to $5.50. This change reflects Krafts anticipated gain on the redemption of its interest in United Biscuits (benefiting Altria by approximately $0.09 per share), Krafts forecast for lower than expected restructuring charges for the full year (negatively impacting Altria by approximately $0.28 per share versus $0.36 per share in previous guidance), and a charge of $0.03 per share for the increase in the allowance for losses related to the airline industry at PMCC. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection.

As described in Note 15. Segment Reporting of Altria Group, Inc.s 2005 Annual Report, management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings contained in this release.

2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
Net revenues for the second quarter of 2006 increased 4.0% versus 2005 to $25.8 billion, including $484 million from acquisitions offset by unfavorable currency of $450 million.
Operating income decreased 1.5% to $4.4 billion, reflecting the items described in the attached reconciliation on Schedule 3, including $247 million in charges for asset impairment and exit costs, primarily at Kraft, an increase of $103 million in the allowance for losses related to the airline industry at PMCC and unfavorable currency of $67 million. These were partially offset by higher results from operations of $227 million, and the positive impact from acquisitions of $81 million, primarily Sampoerna.
Earnings from continuing operations decreased 6.9% to $2.7 billion, reflecting the factors mentioned above and favorable tax items of $227 million, or $0.11 per share, in the second quarter of 2005, primarily due to the repatriation of $6.0 billion of earnings under provisions of the AJCA. The companys effective tax rate was 33.6% in the second quarter of 2006 compared to 28.7% for the same period in 2005, which reflected the dividend repatriation under the AJCA.
Net earnings, including discontinued operations, increased 1.6% to $2.7 billion, aided by a favorable comparison with the second quarter of 2005, when Altria recorded a $245 million net loss from discontinued operations, net of minority interest, as a result of Krafts sale of its sugar confectionery business. Diluted earnings per share, including discontinued operations as detailed on Schedule 1, increased 0.8% to $1.29, driven by the factors mentioned above.
During the second quarter of 2006, Altria Group, Inc. declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.80 per common share, which represents an annualized rate of $3.20 per common share.

2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
For the second quarter of 2006, Philip Morris USA (PM USA), Altria Group, Inc.s domestic tobacco business, delivered solid income growth and strong share performance, driven by
Marlboro
and
Parliament
.
Operating companies income increased 3.2% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by lower wholesale and retail promotional allowance rates, partially offset by lower volume.
Shipment volume of 47.2 billion units was down 4.3% from the previous year, reflecting changes in wholesale and retail trade inventory levels and the timing of 4
th
of July trade purchases versus the year-ago period. Adjusting for those factors, PM USA estimates that shipment volume declined approximately 2.0% in the second quarter of 2006 versus the second quarter of 2005. Premium mix for PM USA increased by 0.4 percentage points to 92.0% in the second quarter of 2006.
As shown in the following table, PM USAs total retail share increased to 50.5% in the second quarter of 2006, driven by
Marlboro
and
Parliament
.
PM USAs share of the premium category was up 0.1 share points to 62.1%, while its share of the discount category grew 0.3 share points to 16.7%. The total industrys premium category share increased 0.9 points to 74.6% in the second quarter of 2006, while the discount category share correspondingly declined to 25.4%. Within the discount category, share of the deep discount segment (which includes both major manufacturers private label brands and all other manufacturers discount brands) declined 0.5 points to 11.3%.

As part of its tobacco category adjacency growth strategy to develop new revenue and income sources for the future, PM USA began test marketing a smoke-free and spit-free tobacco pouch product, called
Taboka
, designed especially for adult smokers interested in smokeless tobacco alternatives to smoking.
Taboka
 
Tobaccopaks
 come in two versions -
Taboka
Original and
Taboka
Green, which is a menthol version. PM USA began test marketing
Taboka
in the Indianapolis area in early July.
On June 19, the Illinois Supreme Court, with consent from both parties, ordered the return to PM USA of the approximately $2.15 billion in cash securing the appeal bond in the
Price
Lights case. A $6 billion note, which also secured the 2003 judgment, will be returned to the company if the U.S. Supreme Court declines to hear the plaintiffs appeal. PM USAs obligations to deposit payments on the note and to pay administrative fees to the Madison County, Illinois clerk also were terminated by the courts order on June 19.
 
2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI), Altria Group, Inc.s international tobacco business, delivered strong volume and income performance in the second quarter of 2006, despite the challenging environment in Spain.
Cigarette shipment volume increased 5.7% to 213.9 billion units. The impact of acquisitions in Indonesia and Colombia, and favorable timing of shipments in Italy, coupled with solid gains in Argentina, France, Poland, Ukraine and worldwide duty-free, were partially offset by declines in Portugal and Spain, as well as Japan and Russia due to unfavorable timing of shipments. Excluding acquisitions, PMIs cigarette shipment volume was up 0.8%. PMIs total tobacco volume, which included 2.2 billion cigarette equivalent units of other tobacco products (OTPs), grew 6.0% to 216.1 billion units.
Operating companies income was up 5.7% to $2.1 billion, due primarily to higher pricing and the favorable impact of acquisitions of $81 million, partially offset by a negative currency impact of $68 million.
PMIs market share in the second quarter of 2006 advanced in many countries, with gains achieved in several major markets including Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.

Total
Marlboro
cigarette shipments of 81.6 billion units were down 2.0%, due mainly to the impact of the timing of shipments in Japan, as well as lower volume in Germany and Argentina.
Marlboro
market shares were up in Australia, Brazil, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. PMI recently launched
Marlboro
Wides in Portugal, France and Spain, and plans additional market introductions later this year.
In the European Union (EU) region, PMIs cigarette shipments were up 0.8%, as gains in France and Poland, and the favorable timing of shipments in Italy, were largely offset by declines in Spain, Germany and Portugal. PMIs cigarette market share in the EU region was 39.3%, down 0.2 points as strong share performances in France, Germany, Italy and Poland were offset by declines in the Czech Republic, Portugal and Spain. Importantly, PMIs share of total tobacco consumption (cigarettes and OTPs) in the EU was up 0.4 points to 35.4%.
In Germany, total tobacco consumption declined 5.6%, but PMIs total tobacco shipments were up 1.2%. PMIs share of total tobacco consumption increased 2.0 points to 30.8%, representing sequential share growth for the third consecutive quarter. The total cigarette market declined 7.8%, while PMIs cigarette volume was down 6.1%, resulting in PMIs cigarette market share rising 0.7 points to 37.6%, driven by
L&M
. Industry volume for tobacco portions declined 14.4% to 4.7 billion units in the second quarter and PMIs share of tobacco portions rose 11.0 points to 25.1%. As of April 2006, tobacco portions can no longer be manufactured under favorable tax conditions in Germany. However, the retail availability of tobacco portions is expected to remain through the third quarter of this year.
In Italy, the total cigarette market declined 1.5%, primarily reflecting two less selling days versus the prior-year quarter. PMIs reported shipment volume was up 19.8%, helped by the timing of shipments and a favorable comparison with the second quarter of 2005, when PMIs new distributor in Italy reduced its inventory by 1.0 billion units. Market share in Italy rose 0.9 points to 53.6%, driven by
Chesterfield
and
Marlboro
, which increased 0.5 share points to 22.8%.
In France, PMIs volume and share performed strongly, reflecting a stable pricing environment and moderate price gaps. Shipments rose 10.9% and share grew 1.1 points to 42.8% behind the continued success of
Marlboro
and the
Philip Morris
brand.
In Spain, the total cigarette market declined 2.5%, but was essentially flat when adjusted for two less selling days in the second quarter of 2006, and reflects some recovery after the first quarter impact of the new tobacco law implemented on January 1. PMIs cigarette shipments were down 14.2%, driven by the lower industry, unfavorable inventory movements and market
 
6
 
share, which was 3.0 points lower at 31.6%. On a sequential basis, PMIs market share has
 
been resilient over the past three quarters at approximately 32%. Most of PMIs share losses, compared to last years second quarter, were the result of declines in
Chesterfield
in the medium-price category and
L&M
in the low-price category. Premium-price
Marlboro
s share in the second quarter was down a more moderate 0.3 share points to 16.7%, while
Chesterfield
and
L&M
were impacted by the repositioning of a competitive brand from the premium-price segment to the low-price segment. In addition, PMIs share was impacted by the continued availability of competitive brands in the super-low segment, priced as low as 1.85 euros for a pack of 20 cigarettes. However, PMI believes that over time its strong brand portfolio will steadily regain market share losses in Spain.
In the Czech Republic, the total market was essentially flat. PMIs shipments were down 12.3% and share was lower, reflecting intense price competition. In Portugal, the total market was down 11.2%, due primarily to lower overall consumption and higher cross-border purchases in Spain. PMIs shipments declined 16.1% in Portugal and share was down 4.7 points to 79.7%, due to severe price competition and excise tax absorption by some manufacturers.
In Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, PMIs shipments grew 0.6%, due mainly to continued gains in Ukraine as well as several North African markets, largely offset by lower shipments in Russia and Turkey. Shipments in Russia were down 2.1%, driven by unfavorable distributor inventory movements versus the prior-year quarter and declines for local lower-margin offerings, as well as
L&M
, partially offset by gains for
Marlboro
,
Muratti
and
Parliament.
In Turkey, shipments were down 4.3%. However, market share rose 2.1 points to 42.6%, driven mainly by the continued success of
Lark
,
 
partially offset by a decline in low-price
Bond Street
.
 
In Ukraine, shipments rose 5.8%, while market share increased 0.6 points to 32.7%, driven by the continued growth of
Marlboro
and
Chesterfield
.
In Asia (including Japan), volume increased 20.5%, driven by the acquisition of Sampoerna in Indonesia. Excluding the acquisition, volume was down 2.4%, due primarily to a difficult comparison with the prior-year quarter in Japan.
In Japan, the total market was inflated by trade loading patterns and rose 13.8%, reflecting trade purchasing ahead of a tax-driven price increase on July 1, 2006. PMIs in-market sales were up 12.7%, also reflecting trade purchasing in advance of the July price increase. Market share declined 0.2 points to 24.4%, although
Marlboro
s share was up 0.2 points to 9.8%. Shipments were down 1.1 billion units or 5.7%, reflecting an unfavorable comparison due to distributor inventory movements related to the return of the
Marlboro
license in Japan in May 2005.
 
7
 
In Indonesia, PMI achieved a 27.5% share in the second quarter, up 1.9 share points on a pro forma basis versus the prior-year quarter, demonstrating the continued strength of its brand portfolio, led by
A Mild
,
Dji Sam Soe
and
A Hijau
.
PMIs volume in Latin America increased 10.1%, due to good performances in Argentina and Mexico, as well as the acquisition of Coltabaco in Colombia. Excluding that acquisition, volume advanced 6.0%. The total market in Argentina was up 10.2%, while PMIs shipments grew 17.5% and share was up 4.1 points to 66.2%, driven by the price repositioning of the
Philip Morris
brand and the recent launch of
Next
in the ultra low-price segment. In Mexico, PMI shipments and market share advanced versus the prior-year quarter, driven by the continued momentum of
Marlboro
and
Benson & Hedges
.
2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
Yesterday, Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) reported 2006 second-quarter results. Krafts net revenues were up 3.4% to $8.6 billion, reflecting positive product mix, the impact of price increases and gains in Eastern Europe and Latin America, as well as solid growth in North America, partially offset by the impact of divestitures, as well as unfavorable currency of $32 million.
Ongoing volume growth of 0.9% included gains in cheese, meats and coffee. Volume growth also included an estimated one percentage point benefit from the shift in timing of Easter shipments versus last year. In addition, the impact of product item pruning and the discontinuation of select product lines represented approximately 2% of prior-year volume.
Operating income decreased 5.8% to $1.2 billion for the second quarter, due to higher asset impairment, exit and implementation costs. However, excluding those costs and gains/losses on the sale of businesses, operating income increased 9.3% and operating income margin increased to 16.6% from 15.7%. These gains were driven by net revenue growth and cost savings. Higher packaging and energy costs partially offset the expansion in operating income margins.

2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
For the second quarter 2006, Kraft North America Commercial (KNAC) net revenues were up 3.4% to $5.9 billion, reflecting increases in Convenient Meals, Snacks & Cereals, Beverages and Cheese & Foodservice and favorable currency of $48 million, partially offset by declines in Grocery. Ongoing volume increased 1.0% due to higher volume in Cheese & Foodservice, Convenient Meals, Grocery and Snacks & Cereals, partially offset by decreases in Beverages, driven largely by the impact of discontinued products. Operating companies income decreased 1.5% to $1.0 billion, with higher asset impairment and exit costs only partially offset by productivity and restructuring savings, positive mix, and favorable currency of $8 million.
2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
For the second quarter 2006, net revenues for Kraft International Commercial (KIC) increased 3.5% to $2.7 billion, reflecting increases in Developing Markets, Oceania & North Asia, partially offset by unfavorable currency of $80 million. Ongoing volume was up 0.5%, with an increase in the European Union partially offset by a slight decline in Developing Markets, Oceania & North Asia. Operating companies income decreased 25.5% to $184 million, due to higher restructuring and impairment charges, as well as unfavorable currency of $7 million, partially offset by positive mix and price increases.
2006 Second-Quarter Results
 
Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) reported an operating companies loss of $59 million for the second quarter of 2006, versus operating companies income of $70 million for the year-earlier period. Results reflect an increase of $103 million in the allowance for losses related to continuing issues within the airline industry. Consistent with its strategic shift in 2003, PMCC is focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities. PMCC is no longer making new investments and expects that its operating companies income will fluctuate over time as leases mature or assets are sold.
