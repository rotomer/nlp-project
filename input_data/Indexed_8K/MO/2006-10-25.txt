Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, October 25, 2006 - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) today announced third-quarter 2006 reported diluted earnings per share of $1.36, including items detailed on the attached Schedule 7, versus $1.38 in the year-ago period.
Comparison of results for the third quarter of 2006 versus the same period a year ago was impacted by a number of items in both years. Absent those items, diluted earnings per share were up 1.5% to $1.39, as detailed in the table below.
 
Our third-quarter results were in line with our internal expectations and we remain on track to meet our earnings target for the full year, said Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive officer of Altria Group, Inc. Our income performance during the third quarter was adversely affected by Philip Morris Internationals continued challenges in Spain and the anticipated inventory depletion in Japan following the July 2006 price increase.
 
In our domestic tobacco business,
Marlboro
continued to gain share of both the total cigarette market and the growing premium segment, Mr. Camilleri said.
 
 
Kraft posted solid earnings gains. However, achieving its goals for stronger top-line growth and sustainable earnings momentum will require continued investment in innovation and brand-building initiatives, Mr. Camilleri said.
The 1.5% increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.39, after excluding the items shown in the table below, was due primarily to favorable operating results at Philip Morris USA (PM USA) and Kraft, as well as favorable net interest expense and better results from Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC). These were partially offset by lower operating results at Philip Morris International (PMI) and a higher tax rate.
 
As shown on Schedule 7, the 1.4% decline in reported diluted earnings per share was due primarily to lower results from international tobacco operations and higher Kraft restructuring charges for the third quarter of 2006 versus 2005, which were partially offset by Krafts gain on the redemption of its interest in United Biscuits (UB) described below. The year-ago period included $204 million in tax benefits, primarily related to the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), offset by an increase of $200 million ($129 million after tax) in the provision for airline industry exposure at PMCC and $23 million in net charges ($15 million after tax) at PM USA related to tobacco quota buy-out legislation.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
In July 2006, Kraft announced an agreement with United Biscuits to acquire the Spanish and Portuguese operations of UB, and rights to all Nabisco trademarks in the European Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa for a total cost of $1.07 billion. The acquisition was financed by Krafts assumption of $541 million of debt issued by the acquired business immediately prior to the acquisition, as well as $530 million of value for the redemption of Krafts outstanding investment in UB. The redemption of Krafts interest in UB resulted in a $251 million pre-tax gain on closing, benefiting Altria Group, Inc. by $0.06 per diluted share.
Kraft also completed the sale of its
Milk Bone
pet snacks brand and assets in July 2006 for $580 million and recorded additional taxes of $59 million related to the sale. This sale and the additional taxes were recorded in the third quarter of 2006.
In addition, on July 27, Kraft announced that it had agreed to sell its
Minute
rice brand and related assets for approximately $280 million. The transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, will result in a gain to Altria Group, Inc. of approximately $140 million or $0.07 per diluted share, after taxes and minority interest.
2006 Full-Year Forecast
Altria projects 2006 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $5.48 to $5.53, versus a previously disclosed range of $5.40 to $5.50. The companys revised forecast includes Krafts gain on the
r
Minute
ice sale (positively impacting Altria by approximately $0.07 per share). It also reflects revisions for Krafts gain on the redemption of its interest in UB (positively impacting Altria by approximately $0.06 per share versus $0.09 per share in previous guidance). It does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions or divestitures. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection.
Debt Rating Upgrade
On October 24, 2006, Moodys Investors Service upgraded the long-term senior unsecured debt rating of Altria Group, Inc. and subsidiaries to Baa1 from Baa2 and affirmed the companys short-term commercial paper rating of Prime-2.

As described in Note 15. Segment Reporting of Altria Group, Inc.s 2005 Annual Report, management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings contained in this release.

2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
Net revenues for the third quarter of 2006 increased 3.7% versus 2005 to $25.9 billion, including favorable currency of $281 million.
 
Operating income increased 9.2% to $4.7 billion, reflecting the items described in the attached reconciliation on Schedule 3, including Krafts $251 million gain on the redemption of its interest in UB, favorable currency of $25 million and higher results from operations of $73 million, partially offset by charges for asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, which were $139 million higher in the third quarter of 2006 versus the year-earlier period, primarily at Kraft. The operating income comparison also benefited from charges recorded in the year-ago period for airline industry exposure at PMCC and net charges at PM USA related to tobacco quota buy-out legislation.
 
Net earnings decreased 0.3% to $2.9 billion, reflecting the factors mentioned above and favorable tax items in the third quarter of 2005 of $204 million, or $0.10 per share, due primarily to the repatriation of earnings under provisions of the AJCA. The companys effective tax rate was 35.4% in the third quarter of 2006, compared to 27.4% for the same period in 2005.
 
Diluted earnings per share, as detailed on Schedule 1, decreased 1.4% to $1.36, driven by the factors mentioned above.
 
During the third quarter of 2006, Altria Group, Inc. increased its regular quarterly dividend by 7.5% to $0.86 per common share, which represents an annualized rate of $3.44 per common share.
2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
For the third quarter of 2006, Philip Morris USA (PM USA), Altria Group, Inc.s domestic tobacco business, delivered strong share performance, driven by
Marlboro
.
 
Operating companies income increased 5.7% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by lower wholesale promotional allowance rates and a favorable comparison with items in the third quarter of 2005, partially offset by lower volume and spending for various excise tax ballot initiatives. Results for the third quarter of 2005 included the previously mentioned net charges at PM USA related to tobacco quota buy-out legislation and a pre-tax provision of $56 million for the
Boeken
individual smoking case.
 
Shipment volume of 47.6 billion units was down 0.6% from the previous year, reflecting changes in wholesale and retail trade inventory levels, the timing of 4th of July trade purchases and one less shipping day versus the year-ago period. Adjusting for those factors, PM USA estimates that shipment volume declined approximately 2% in the third quarter of 2006 versus the year-ago period, and was down approximately 1.5% for the first nine months of 2006 versus the same period in 2005. Premium mix for PM USA increased by 0.3 percentage points to 92.0% in the third quarter of 2006.
 
As shown in the following table, PM USAs total retail share increased to 50.4% in the third quarter of 2006, driven by
Marlboro
.
PM USAs share of the premium category was down 0.1 share point versus the year-earlier period to 62.1%, as the gain by
Marlboro
was more than offset by segment share losses incurred by other PM USA non-focus premium brands. PM USAs share of the discount category grew 0.1 share point to 16.3%. The total industrys premium category share increased 0.7 points to 74.3% in the third quarter of 2006, while the discount category share correspondingly declined to 25.7%. Within the discount category, share of the deep discount segment (which includes both major manufacturers private label brands and all other manufacturers discount brands) declined 0.2 points to 11.7% versus the year-ago period.
 
2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
At Philip Morris International (PMI), Altria Group, Inc.s international tobacco business, results in the third quarter of 2006 were adversely impacted by performance in Japan and Spain. However, PMI projects that it will achieve strong growth in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
In the third quarter of 2006, cigarette shipment volume for PMI declined 0.5% to 215.9 billion units. Continuing challenges in Spain, lower volume in Turkey, Portugal and Romania and trade inventory depletion in Japan after the July 2006 price increase were largely offset by gains in Indonesia, Italy, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Mexico and Argentina. PMIs total tobacco volume, which included 2.3 billion cigarette equivalent units of other tobacco products (OTPs), declined 0.4% to 218.2 billion units.
 
Operating companies income was down 3.8% to $2.1 billion, and down 2.3% excluding asset impairment and exit costs. The decline was due primarily to unfavorable volume/mix in Japan and lower pricing in Spain, partially offset by higher pricing elsewhere in PMI. Spain and Japan together contributed approximately eight percentage points to the decline in third-quarter 2006 operating companies income.
 
     PMIs market share in the third quarter of 2006 advanced in many countries, with gains in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Egypt, Finland, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, Mexico, Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Serbia and Ukraine.
   
 
     Total
   
Marlboro
cigarette shipments of 80.5 billion units were down 2.1%, due mainly to Germany, Argentina and Japan. However,
Marlboro
market shares were up in Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and Ukraine.
 
In the European Union (EU) region, PMIs cigarette shipments were down 0.9%, as declines in Spain, Germany and Portugal were partially offset by gains in Italy, Poland and Hungary. PMIs cigarette market share in the EU region was flat at 39.6%. Importantly, PMIs share of total tobacco consumption (cigarettes and OTPs) in the EU was up 0.4 points to 35.9%.
 
In Germany, total tobacco consumption declined 9.5%. However, adjusted for one less selling day in the quarter this year, consumption was down 8.1%, mainly attributable to a significant decline in tobacco portions, with inventories of these products now essentially exhausted. PMIs total tobacco shipments were down 0.6%, but its share of total tobacco consumption increased 2.8 points to 31.5%. The total cigarette market declined 1.8%, while PMIs cigarette volume and market share declined by 2.2% and 0.1 points to 36.5%, respectively.
 
In Italy, the total cigarette market rose 0.7%. PMIs shipment volume was up 4.2% and market share rose 1.2 points to 54.1%.
Marlboro
share increased 0.5 points to 23.0%, while share for
Diana
was also higher, up 0.5 points to 13.6%.
 
In France, the total market was essentially unchanged versus the prior-year quarter. PMIs shipments were down 2.0% due to timing of trade purchases. Market share continued to grow, rising 0.8 points to 42.5% on the strength of
Marlboro
and the
Philip Morris
brand.
 
In Spain, the total cigarette market declined 7.9%, due mainly to an unfavorable comparison with the third quarter of 2005, which benefited from trade purchases as a result of an anticipated industry price increase that did not occur, as well as the tobacco legislation in force since January 1, 2006. PMIs cigarette shipments were down 12.4% in the third quarter of 2006 versus the year-ago period, and market share declined 3.1 points to 32.2%, primarily due to
L&M
and
Chesterfield
. Sequentially, PMIs market share was up 0.6 points versus the second quarter of 2006 and share for
Marlboro
was up 0.7 points to 17.4% in the third quarter of 2006 versus the previous quarter, demonstrating its continued resilience.
 
In Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, PMIs shipments declined 0.7% due to Turkey and Romania, largely offset by strong gains in Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Egypt. In Turkey, shipments were down 12.2%, due mainly to the decline of low-price
, 
Bond Street
partially offset by gains of higher-margin brands
Parliament
and
Muratti
. Market share in Turkey declined 0.7 points to 41.9%. However, overall mix continued to improve, driven by gains of
Parliament
.
 
In Romania, shipments were down 31.4% and share declined 2.5 points to 31.0%, mainly due to
L&M
. However,
Marlboro
share was up 2.0 points to 12.2%. In Russia, shipments rose 3.3%, driven by
Marlboro
,
Muratti
and
Parliament
.
 
Although share was down 0.5 points, this primarily reflected declines of PMIs low-price brands and
L&M
. Combined market share in Russia for PMIs higher-margin brands, including
Marlboro
and
Parliament
, was up 0.4 points versus the prior-year period. In Ukraine, shipments grew 8.8% and share advanced 1.2 points to 33.4% as consumers continued to trade up to higher priced
,
Marlboro
Parliament
and
Chesterfield
.
 
In Asia, volume was down 1.5%, due primarily to a difficult comparison with the prior-year quarter in Japan, partially offset by gains in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand.
 
In Japan, PMIs shipments were down 1.8 billion units or 10.4%, due mainly to a 22.7% total market decline, partially offset by the favorable timing of shipments. The industry contraction in the third quarter reflects trade inventory depletion after the tax-driven price increase on July 1, 2006. PMIs in-market sales were down 22.5% and market share was up 0.1 points to 25.0%.
Marlboro
s share rose 0.3 points to 10.2%.
 
In Indonesia, PMIs shipment volume rose 9.1% and market share increased 1.5 points to 28.2%, demonstrating the continued strength of its brand portfolio, led by
A Hijau
,
A Mild
and
Dji Sam Soe
.
 
PMIs volume in Latin America increased 4.4%, due mainly to gains in Argentina and Mexico, partially offset by Colombia, which was negatively impacted by the timing of shipments. The total market in Argentina was up 7.8%, while PMIs shipments grew 18.2% and share was up 5.9 points to 66.9%, due primarily to the continued growth of the
Philip Morris
brand. In Mexico, PMI shipments advanced 5.8% and market share rose 1.9 points to 63.8%, reflecting the continued momentum of
,
Marlboro
which rose 2.2 share points to 48.1%.
2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) reported 2006 third-quarter results on October 23, 2006. Krafts net revenues were up 2.3% to $8.2 billion, driven by North American convenient meals, cheese, snacks, cereals and powdered beverages, as well as Latin America and Eastern Europe and favorable currency of $125 million, partially offset by the impact of divestitures.
 
Ongoing volume declined 1.9%, due primarily to the impact of product item pruning and the discontinuation of select product lines, primarily in the North American Foodservice and Canadian ready-to-drink beverage businesses, as well as weakness in several beverage and grocery franchises. Partially offsetting those factors were strong gains achieved across numerous products, including
Oscar Mayer
meats,
Post
cereals,
Kraft
natural cheese,
DiGiorno
pizza and
Wheat Thins
snack crackers.
 
Operating income increased 18.2% to $1.4 billion for the third quarter, benefiting from the gain on the redemption of Krafts interest in UB and also from lower dairy costs, improved product mix and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings, partially offset by higher marketing spending to support brand equity, higher asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, and higher energy and packaging costs. Excluding the asset impairment, exit and implementation costs and gains/losses on the sale of businesses, operating income increased 5.6% and the resulting operating income margin increased to 15.2% from 14.8% recorded in the corresponding prior-year period.
 
 
2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
For the third quarter 2006, Kraft North America Commercial (KNAC) net revenues were up 0.7% to $5.6 billion versus the prior-year quarter, reflecting increases in Beverages, Convenient Meals and Snacks & Cereals and favorable currency of $52 million, partially offset by declines in Cheese & Foodservice and Grocery. Ongoing volume decreased 2.1% due to decreases in Beverages, Cheese & Foodservice and Grocery, partially offset by increases in Convenient Meals and Snacks & Cereals. Operating companies income decreased 1.9% to $930 million, with higher asset impairment, exit and implementation costs only partially offset by productivity and restructuring savings, positive mix, and favorable currency of $12 million.
2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
For the third quarter 2006, net revenues for Kraft International Commercial (KIC) increased 5.8% to $2.7 billion versus the prior-year quarter, reflecting increases in the European Union and Developing Markets, Oceania & North Asia, and favorable currency of $73 million. Ongoing volume was down 1.4%, due primarily to declines in grocery and cheese. Operating companies income increased 86.1% to $469 million, due primarily to a $251 million gain on redemption of Krafts interest in UB, as well as positive mix, price increases and favorable currency of $8 million, partially offset by lower volume and higher asset impairment, exit and implementation costs.
2006 Third-Quarter Results
 
Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) reported operating companies income of $101 million for the third quarter of 2006, versus an operating companies loss of $121 million for the third quarter of 2005. Results for the third quarter of 2006 were significantly above the comparable period in 2005 due to gains from asset sales and a $200 million loss provision taken in the third quarter of 2005 related to the airline industry.
 
Consistent with its strategic shift in 2003, PMCC is focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities. PMCC is no longer making new investments and expects that its operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.
