FOURTH-QUARTER 2006
 Reported diluted earnings per share up 28.4% to $1.40 vs. $1.09 in year-ago quarter, including the items detailed on Schedule 7
 Adjusted for items detailed in table below, diluted earnings per share up 8.5% to $1.27 versus $1.17 in year-ago quarter
FULL-YEAR 2006
 Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations up 12.0% to $5.71 versus $5.10 in 2005, including the items detailed on Schedule 8
 Adjusted for items detailed in table below, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations up 4.9% to $5.35 versus $5.10 in 2005
2007 OUTLOOK
 Reported 2007 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are forecast in a range of $4.15 to $4.20 at current exchange rates. This forecast includes charges of approximately $0.08 per share and excludes Kraft, which will be accounted for as a discontinued operation for the full-year 2007, reflecting the distribution of Kraft shares.
 Adjusted for the $.08 per share of charges, Altria projects that the growth rate of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the mid-single-digit range for the full-year 2007, from an adjusted base of $4.05 per share for 2006.
 
NEW YORK, January 31, 2007 - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) today announced fourth-quarter 2006 reported diluted earnings per share were up 28.4% to $1.40, including items detailed on the attached Schedule 7, versus $1.09 in the year-ago period. Adjusted for items detailed in the table below, diluted earnings per share were up 8.5% to $1.27, versus $1.17 in the year-earlier period.
For the full year 2006, reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 12.0% to $5.71, including items detailed on Schedule 8, versus $5.10 for the full year 2005. Adjusted for items detailed in the table below, diluted earnings per share were up 4.9% to $5.35, versus $5.10 for 2005.
We finished 2006 with a strong fourth quarter and enter 2007 on an exciting note with todays announcement of the spin-off of Kraft Foods to Altria shareholders, said Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive officer of Altria Group, Inc.
For the full year 2006, our tobacco businesses achieved strong results, benefiting from improving trends in Western Europe at Philip Morris International and from an increase in total retail share, to 50.3%, at Philip Morris USA, Mr. Camilleri said. Looking ahead, I believe that Kraft has a bright future as a fully-independent company, and that our tobacco businesses will continue to create enduring shareholder value.
Kraft Spin-Off
As announced in a separate news release, the Board of Directors of Altria Group, Inc. voted earlier today to authorize the spin-off of all shares of Kraft Foods Inc. owned by Altria to Altrias shareholders. The distribution of the approximately 89% of Krafts outstanding shares owned by Altria will be made on March 30, 2007, to Altria shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2007.
Altria will distribute approximately 0.7 of a share of Kraft for every share of Altria common stock outstanding as of the record date, based on the number of Altria shares outstanding at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on that date. The exact distribution ratio will be determined on the record date. On or about March 20, 2007, Altria will mail an Information Statement to all shareholders of Altria common stock as of the record date.

2006 Results Excluding Items
After adjusting for the items shown in the table below, the 8.5% increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.27 for the fourth quarter of 2006 reflected strong tobacco operating results and positive currency of $0.01 per share, partially offset by the negative impact of the inclusion of an extra week of results at Kraft in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year 2006, the 4.9% increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $5.35 after adjusting for the items shown in the table was primarily driven by the same factors, partially offset by unfavorable currency of $0.05 per share.
 
Asset impairment and exit costs recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006 included the non-cash pre-tax charge of $245 million or $0.07 per diluted share related to Krafts
Tassimo
single-serve hot beverage system. The diluted earnings per share figures shown in the table above include the impact of acquisitions and divestitures in 2006 and 2005, as well as the extra week of shipments at Kraft in 2005.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
In July 2006, Kraft agreed to acquire the Spanish and Portuguese operations of United Biscuits (UB), and rights to all Nabisco trademarks in the European Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, for a total cost of $1.1 billion. The non-cash acquisition was financed by Krafts assumption of $541 million of debt issued by the acquired business immediately prior to the acquisition, as well as $530 million of value for the redemption of Krafts outstanding investment in UB. The redemption of Krafts investment in UB resulted in a $251 million pre-tax gain on closing, benefiting Altria Group, Inc. by $0.06 per diluted share, after taxes and minority interest.
Kraft also completed the sale of its
Milk-Bone
pet snacks brand and assets in July 2006 for approximately $580 million and recorded additional taxes of approximately $60 million related to the sale. This sale and the additional taxes were recorded in the third quarter of 2006 and resulted in a negative impact of $0.03 per share to Altria Group, Inc., after taxes and minority interest.
In addition, Kraft agreed to sell its
Minute
 
Rice
brand and related assets for approximately $280 million during 2006. The transaction closed in the fourth quarter and resulted in a pre-tax gain to Altria Group, Inc. of approximately $226 million or $0.07 per diluted share, after taxes and minority interest.
In November 2006, Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) announced that it was reorganizing its tobacco and beer equity holdings in the Dominican Republic. The transaction was completed before the end of the year, and PMI now owns 100% of the cigarette business and no longer holds an interest in the beer business of E. Len Jimenes, C. por. A. The transaction increased Altrias 2006 pre-tax income by $488 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
On January 19, 2007, PMI announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 50.21% stake in Pakistan cigarette manufacturer, Lakson Tobacco Company Limited from a number of Lakson Tobaccos principal shareholders for approximately $339 million. PMI currently holds a 40% stake in Lakson Tobacco and the transaction will bring PMIs stake to approximately 90%. On January 24, 2007, PMI notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and local stock exchanges of its intention to publicly announce and commence a public tender offer on February 15, 2007, for the remaining shares. Lakson Tobacco is Pakistans second-largest tobacco company, with cigarette volume of approximately 30 billion units in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006. Based on a price per share of $10.96, the company is valued at approximately $675 million.

2007 Full-Year Forecast
Altria forecasts reported 2007 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $4.15 to $4.20 at current exchange rates and excluding Kraft, which will be accounted for as a discontinued operation for the full-year 2007, reflecting the distribution of Kraft shares. The companys projection includes a higher tax rate in 2007 versus 2006, and charges of approximately $0.08 per share.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are forecast to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the full-year 2007, versus $4.05 per share for 2006 including certain net charges shown below.
The companys forecast excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions or divestitures. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection.

As described in Note 15. Segment Reporting of Altria Group, Inc.s 2005 Annual Report, management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings contained in this release.

Altria Group, Inc.s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 included a 53
rd
week for Kraft. Krafts subsidiaries generally end their fiscal years on the last Saturday of the year. Accordingly, most years contain 52 weeks of operating results, while every fifth or sixth year includes 53 weeks. The extra week at Kraft added an estimated $625 million in net revenues and $100 million in operating companies income to Altrias results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2005.
References to international tobacco market share are PMI estimates based on a number of industry sources. All references in this news release are to continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.
2006 Fourth-Quarter Results
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 3.7% versus the year-ago quarter to $25.4 billion, including acquisitions, favorable currency of $413 million and the positive impact of pricing, primarily at PMI. Comparison with the year-ago period was adversely impacted by the extra week at Kraft in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Operating income increased 16.2% to $4.2 billion, reflecting the items described in the attached reconciliation on Schedule 3, including the $488 million gain from PMIs reorganization of its tobacco and beer equity holdings in the Dominican Republic, the gain on the sale of
Minute Rice
, acquisitions, favorable currency of $45 million and higher results from operations of $87 million, driven by international and domestic tobacco. These increases were partially offset by charges for asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, which were $204 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2006 versus the year-earlier period, and the impact of the extra week at Kraft in 2005.
Net earnings increased 29.3% to $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting the factors mentioned above and a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2006. The companys effective tax rate was 26.6% in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 30.7% for the same period in 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the mix of foreign earnings and taxes, reversals of tax accruals no longer required and the favorable resolution of foreign tax audits.
Diluted earnings per share, as detailed on Schedule 1, increased 28.4% to $1.40.

2006 Full-Year Results
Net revenues for the full year 2006 increased 3.6% versus 2005 to $101.4 billion. The comparison with 2005 includes the favorable impact from acquisitions of $1.3 billion and an increase in net revenues from tobacco and international food, partially offset by unfavorable currency of $506 million, divestitures and the additional week at Kraft in 2005.
Operating income increased 4.9% to $17.4 billion, reflecting the items described in the attached reconciliation on Schedule 6, including PMIs gain on the Dominican Republic transaction, Krafts $251 million gain on the redemption of its interest in UB, Krafts gain on the sale of
Minute Rice
, acquisitions and higher results from operations of $511 million, driven by increases in all businesses. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency of $154 million, charges for asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, which were $570 million higher in 2006 including the
Tassimo
asset impairment charge, and the extra shipping week at Kraft in 2005. The operating income comparison also benefited from charges recorded for airline industry exposure at Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) of $200 million in 2005 versus $103 million in 2006, and net charges at Philip Morris USA (PM USA) related to tobacco quota buy-out legislation.
Earnings from continuing operations increased 12.7% to $12.0 billion, primarily reflecting the items mentioned above and a lower effective tax rate in 2006. The companys effective tax rate was 26.3% for the full year 2006. The 2006 tax rate includes the benefit from the reversal of tax reserves following the conclusion of an IRS examination of Altrias consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999, as announced in the first quarter of 2006, and the other tax benefits mentioned above. By comparison, the companys effective tax rate for the full year 2005 was 29.9%.
Net earnings, including discontinued operations, increased 15.2% to $12.0 billion, reflecting the factors mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share, including discontinued operations as detailed on Schedule 4, increased 14.4% to $5.71.
During 2006, Altria Group, Inc. increased its regular quarterly dividend by 7.5% to $0.86 per common share, which represents an annualized rate of $3.44 per common share.

Marlboro
and
Parliament
.

Wides.
2006 Full-Year Results
Cigarette shipment volume for PMI increased 3.4% versus 2005 to 831.4 billion units, driven mainly by higher volume in Argentina, Colombia, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Russia and Ukraine. Partially offsetting these increases was lower volume in Belarus, Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Thailand and Turkey. Excluding acquisitions, and adjusting for the one-time inventory benefit in Italy in 2005, PMIs cigarette shipment volume was up 0.4%. PMIs total tobacco volume, which included 8.3 billion cigarette equivalent units of other tobacco products (OTPs), increased 3.5% to 839.7 billion units. Total tobacco volume increased 0.6% excluding acquisitions and the one-time inventory benefit in Italy in 2005.
Operating companies income increased 8.1% to $8.5 billion, due primarily to pricing, the Dominican Republic transaction and a $232 million benefit from acquisitions. These were partially offset by negative currency of $183 million, a $61 million charge in the first quarter of 2006 related to an Italian antitrust action and higher asset impairment and exit costs.

2006 Fourth-Quarter Results
Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) also reported 2006 fourth-quarter and full-year results today. Krafts net revenues decreased 3.0% to $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting one less shipping week in 2006 compared to 2005, which negatively impacted reported net revenues by approximately 7.0 percentage points.
Total ongoing volume declined 4.4%, reflecting the estimated 7.0 percentage point impact of one less week in 2006. However, there were strong performances from a number of products, including
Oscar Mayer
meats and
Nabisco
cookies and snack crackers in North America,
Milka
chocolate in the EU,
Jacobs
soluble coffee in Russia and Ukraine, and
Lacta
chocolate in Brazil. These gains were partially offset by product item pruning and the discontinuation of select product lines, primarily in North America Foodservice and in the Canadian ready-to-drink beverage business, as well as share declines in
Maxwell House
coffee,
Kraft
salad dressings and
Planters
snacks nuts.
Operating income decreased 18.6% to $974 million. Excluding asset impairment, exit and implementation costs and gains/losses on the sale of businesses, operating income decreased 11.3% and operating income margin decreased to 14.2% in 2006 from 15.6% in 2005. The decline was primarily due to higher investments in marketing and in research and development.
2006 Full-Year Results
For the full year 2006, Krafts net revenues were up 0.7% to $34.4 billion, primarily reflecting the factors mentioned above, including one less shipping week, which negatively impacted net revenues by approximately 2.0 percentage points.
Ongoing volume declined 1.7%, due primarily to the impact of product item pruning and the discontinuation of select product lines, primarily in the North American Foodservice and Canadian ready-to-drink beverage businesses, as well as one less shipping week in 2006. Partially offsetting those factors were strong gains achieved across numerous products, including those mentioned for the fourth quarter.
Operating income decreased 4.8% to $4.5 billion for 2006 versus 2005, due primarily to higher asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, including the
Tassimo
charge, and one less shipping week in 2006, partially offset by the gain on the redemption of Krafts investment in UB in the third quarter of 2006.

2006 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Results
Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) reported operating companies income of $38 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $176 million for the full year 2006, versus $41 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $31 million for the full year 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of 2006 reflect lower revenues, primarily as a result of lower investment balances. Results for the full year 2006 include higher gains from asset sales and an increase of $103 million in the provision for losses related to the airline industry during the second quarter of 2006, versus a $200 million increase in the third quarter of 2005.
Consistent with its strategic shift in 2003, PMCC is focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities. PMCC is no longer making new investments and expects that its operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.
