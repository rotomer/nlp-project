2007 Second-Quarter Results Excluding Items
     After adjusting for the items shown in the table below, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9.5% to $1.15 for the second quarter of 2007.
2007 Full-Year Forecast
     Altria revised its forecast to a range of $4.05 to $4.10 for reported 2007 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, reflecting $0.15 in additional charges for asset impairment and exit costs, versus its previously announced range of $4.20 to $4.25. The revised projection includes charges of $0.24 per share, which are $0.15 per share higher ($0.12 for PM USA and $0.03 for PMI) than the $0.09 in previously forecasted charges. The projection also includes $0.06 per share for cash recoveries at Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC), which were recorded in the first half of 2007.
     The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection.
 
Manufacturing Optimization Program
     On June 26, 2007 Altria announced plans by its tobacco operating subsidiaries to optimize worldwide cigarette production by moving U.S.-based cigarette production for non-U.S. markets to PMI facilities in Europe. PMI is expected to shift sourcing of approximately 57 billion cigarettes to facilities in Europe by the third quarter of 2008, while PM USA will close its Cabarrus, NC manufacturing facility by the end of 2010 and consolidate manufacturing for the U.S. market at its Richmond, VA Manufacturing Center.
     PM USA recorded an initial pre-tax charge of $318 million or $0.10 per share in the second quarter of 2007 for costs related to the program, primarily for employee separation, with additional estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $55 million or $0.02 per share for the remainder of 2007. The program is expected to generate cost savings beginning in 2008, with total estimated annual cost savings of approximately $335 million by 2011, of which $179 million will be realized by PMI and $156 million by PM USA. Cumulative total expenses through 2011 are estimated at approximately $670 million, all of which will be at PM USA.
PMI Announces Agreement in Principle to Acquire Additional 30% Stake in Mexican Tobacco Business
     On July 18, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement in principle to acquire an additional 30% stake in its Mexican tobacco business from its joint venture partner, Grupo Carso, S.A.B. de C.V.
     PMI currently holds a 50% stake in its Mexican tobacco business and this transaction would bring PMI's stake to 80%. Grupo Carso would retain a 20% stake in the business.
     The transaction has a value of approximately $1.1 billion and is expected to be completed later this year, subject to execution of definitive agreements and customary regulatory approvals. When completed, the transaction is expected to increase Altria's annualized net earnings by approximately $0.03 per share.

Segment Reporting" of Altria Group, Inc.'s 2006 Annual Report, management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.

Altria Group, Inc.'s 2007 reported results and previous-year results reflect Kraft as a discontinued operation. As such, net revenues and operating companies income for Kraft are excluded from the company's results, while the net earnings impact is included as a single line item.
     
The products of Altria's subsidiaries include cigarettes and other tobacco products manufactured and sold by Philip Morris USA (PM USA) in the United States and by Philip Morris International (PMI) outside the United States. PMI's operations are organized and managed by geographic region. Beginning with the second quarter of 2007, Altria's reportable segments are U.S. Tobacco; European Union (EU); Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (EEMA); Asia; Latin America; and Financial Services.

2007 Second-Quarter Results
     Revenues net of excise taxes and currency increased 2.9% to $9.5 billion for the second quarter of 2007, driven by all segments except PMCC.
     Operating income increased 0.6% to $3.2 billion, reflecting the items described in the attached reconciliation on Schedule 3, including higher results from operations of $126 million, favorable currency of $87 million and the net impact of a cash recovery of $78 million at PMCC from assets which had been previously written down, compared to a provision of $103 million at PMCC in the second quarter of 2006. Largely offsetting those factors were asset impairment and exit costs of $394 million, primarily at PM USA.
     Earnings from continuing operations increased 4.9% to $2.2 billion, reflecting the items above as well as a decrease in interest expense due to lower debt outstanding. The company's effective tax rate at 33.5% was unchanged for the second quarter of 2007 versus the year-earlier period.
     Net earnings, including discontinued operations, decreased 18.3% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the Kraft spin-off and the factors mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share, including discontinued operations as detailed on Schedule 1, decreased 18.6% to $1.05.
 
2007 Second-Quarter Results
     Philip Morris USA (PM USA), Altria Group, Inc.'s U.S. tobacco business, reported that its second-quarter revenues net of excise taxes increased 1.5% to $3.9 billion. Operating companies income decreased 22.8% to $1.0 billion compared to the year-earlier period. The decline was largely a result of the $318 million pre-tax charge for asset impairment and exit costs related to the previously announced closure of the Cabarrus, NC cigarette manufacturing facility, as well as lower volume and increased resolution expenses, partially offset by lower wholesale promotional allowance rates and lower expenses for marketing, administrative and research costs. Adjusted for the $318 million in asset impairment and exit costs, PM USA's operating companies income would have increased by 1.6% to $1.3 billion.
     PM USA's cigarette shipment volume of 45.6 billion units was 3.3% or 1.6 billion units lower than that recorded in the prior-year period. In the first half of 2007, PM USA estimates that total cigarette industry volume declined between 4% and 5%, and for the full year 2007 PM USA is maintaining its prior estimate of a 3% to 4% decline in total cigarette industry volume.
     Cigarette volume performance by brand for PM USA is summarized in the table below:
     PM USA's total retail share was unchanged at 50.5% in the second quarter of 2007 versus the prior-year period. However, had a strong gain of 0.4 retail share points.

     Cigarette shipment volume increased 3.3% or 7.1 billion units to 221.0 billion units, due largely to acquisition volume from Lakson Tobacco in Pakistan. Gains in Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and Ukraine, as well as the favorable timing of shipments in certain markets, were offset by shipment declines in Russia, Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as Japan, where comparisons to the second quarter of 2006 were distorted by heavy trade purchases in anticipation of the July 2006 excise tax increase. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, PMI's cigarette shipment volume was down 0.5%.

2007 Second-Quarter Results
     Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) reported operating companies income of $139 million for the second quarter of 2007 versus an operating companies loss of $59 million for the year-earlier period. Second-quarter 2007 results reflected cash recoveries of $78 million from the sale of bankruptcy claims related to certain airline leases that had been previously written down and higher asset management gains versus the prior year, partially offset by lower lease revenues, primarily as a result of lower investment balances. The prior-year results reflected a charge of $103 million to the provision for losses related to the airline industry.
     Consistent with its strategic shift in 2003, PMCC is focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities. PMCC is no longer making new investments and expects that its operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.
