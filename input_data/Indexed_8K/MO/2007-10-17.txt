2007 Third-Quarter Results Excluding Items
After adjusting for the items shown in the table below, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 13.1% to $1.21 for the third quarter of 2007, versus $1.07 in the corresponding prior-year period.
 
2007 Full-Year Forecast
Altria raised its forecast to a range of $4.20 to $4.25 for 2007 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, reflecting a lower tax rate ($0.08 per share), favorable currency ($0.04 per share) and improved results ($0.03 per share) at Philip Morris International (PMI). The company's previously announced range for 2007 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.05 to $4.10.
The revised projection includes charges of $0.17 per share, which are $0.07 per share lower due mainly to the above-mentioned one-time favorable tax items, versus $0.24 per share in charges in the previous forecast. Both the revised and previous projections include $0.06 per share for cash recoveries at Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC), which were recorded in the first half of 2007.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this projection.
 
Intention to Pursue the Spin-Off of Philip Morris International

In addition to a final determination by the Board, the spin-off of PMI will be subject to the receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel, the effectiveness of a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as the execution of several inter-company agreements and the finalization of other matters.
On September 27, PMI filed with the SEC a preliminary registration statement on Form 10 in preparation for its potential spin-off from Altria. In addition, Altria submitted a private letter ruling request to the Internal Revenue Service.

Third-quarter revenues net of excise taxes increased 3.2% to $4.0 billion. Operating companies income increased 2.0% to $1.3 billion compared to the year-earlier period. The increase was driven by lower wholesale promotional allowance rates and lower selling, general and administrative costs. Those factors were partially offset by increased resolution expenses, lower volume, investments in support of PM USA's adjacency strategy and a $22 million pre-tax charge related to asset impairment, exit and implementation costs for the previously announced closure of the Cabarrus, NC cigarette manufacturing facility. Adjusted for the $22 million pre-tax charge, PM USA's operating companies income would have increased by 3.7%.
