On December 4, 2007, Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. ("Altria"), entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") relating to (i) a senior unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the "5-Year Revolving Credit Facility"), (ii) a senior unsecured 3-year revolving credit facility (the "3-Year Revolving Credit Facility," and together with the 5-Year Revolving Credit Facility, the "Revolving Credit Facilities") and (iii) a senior unsecured 364-day term loan facility (the "Term Facility," and together with the Revolving Credit Facilities, the "Facilities"), with the lenders named therein and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as facility agent. The Facilities are not guaranteed by Altria and Altria has no obligations thereunder. The 5-Year Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of US$3.0 billion (or the equivalent in Euro) and expires on December 4, 2012. The 3-Year Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of US$1.0 billion (or the equivalent in Euro) and expires on December 4, 2010. The Term Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1.5 billion and expires on December 2, 2008.
Interest rates on borrowings under the Facilities will be based on prevailing interest rates for the Euro or U.S. Dollar, as applicable, and as further described in the Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. The Term Facility will be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of amounts outstanding under the term facility dated May 12, 2005, among PMI, the lenders party thereto and Citibank International plc, as facility agent ("2005 Term Facility").
The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of an EBITDA to interest ratio, as defined therein, of not less than 3.5 to 1.
The Credit Agreement permits PMI to designate any wholly-owned subsidiary as a borrower under the Facilities. The obligations of any designated subsidiary under the Credit Agreement will be guaranteed by PMI. FTR Holding S.A. ("FTRH"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PMI, was designated as a borrower at the time of the closing of the Facilities.
The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default customary for credit facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including nonpayment of principal or interest when due; material incorrectness of representations and warranties when made; breach of covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency; unsatisfied ERISA obligations; unstayed material judgment beyond specified periods; acceleration or payment default of other material indebtedness; and invalidation of PMI's guaranty.
If any events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, the outstanding loans may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. The occurrence of the bankruptcy and insolvency event of default will result in the automatic termination of commitments and acceleration of outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement.
Some of the lenders under the agreements and their affiliates have various relationships with Altria, PMI and their subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking and trust services. In addition, Altria, PMI and some of their subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates.
 
The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
 
On December 4, 2007, FTRH borrowed EUR 1.5 billion under the Term Facility to repay the 2005 Term Facility.

(e) . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in Section 2.6 or Section 2.12, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 1% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance.
Default Interest
 
(b) If any Borrower or PMI shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.19) such Lender or
 
Agent (as the case may be), receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or PMI shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower or PMI shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. If clause (i) of this Section 2.19(b) is unenforceable for any reason in respect of any Borrower, then:
 
 
 
 
divided by a factor equal to one (1) minus the amount of the Tax Deduction expressed as a multiplier (i.e., ten (10) percent will be expressed as 0.10 and not as 10%); and
 
(c) In addition, each Borrower or PMI shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "").
Other Taxes
(d) Each Borrower and PMI shall indemnify each Lender and each Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.19) paid by such Lender or Agent (as the case may be), and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or Agent (as the case may be), makes written demand therefor.
(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each Borrower and PMI shall furnish to the relevant Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.2, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. If any Borrower or PMI determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower or PMI shall, at the request of the relevant Agent, furnish or cause the payor to furnish, such Agent and each Lender an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to such Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.
 
(f) Each Lender, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, shall provide each of the Agents, PMI and each other Borrower with any form or certificate that is required by any taxing authority (including, if applicable, two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service), certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes on payments pursuant to this Agreement. Thereafter, each such Lender shall provide additional forms or certificates (i) to the extent a form or certificate previously provided has become inaccurate or invalid or has otherwise ceased to be effective or (ii) as requested in writing by any Borrower, PMI or the relevant Agent. Unless the Borrowers, PMI and the Agents have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes or are subject to Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, such Borrowers, PMI or Agents shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender.
(g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select or change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a selection or change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise economically disadvantageous to such Lender.
(h) No additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 with respect to (i) any Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that would not have been payable had the Lender provided the relevant forms or other documents pursuant to Section 2.19(f); or (ii) in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance by a Lender to an Eligible Assignee, any Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that exceed the amount of such Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that are imposed prior to such Assignment and Acceptance, unless such Assignment and Acceptance resulted from the demand of PMI.
(i) No additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 with respect to any taxes imposed by the United States by means of withholding tax on payments made by any Borrower to any Lender's Applicable Lending Office or to any Agent, even if such taxes are imposed as a result of the treatment of payments made by a Borrower that is not organized under the laws of the United States as having been made by a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes, including as a result of an election made to treat such Borrower as a disregarded entity for United States federal income tax purposes (regardless of whether such election was made after such Borrower became a Borrower under this Agreement), if and to the extent such taxes were in effect
 
and would have been applicable as of the date hereof to payments to be made by a United States person to such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or to such Agent (as the case may be).
(j) If any Lender or Agent, as the case may be, obtains a refund of any Tax for which payment has been made pursuant to this Section 2.19, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, (and without any obligation to disclose its tax records) is allocable to such payment made under this Section 2.19, the amount of such refund (together with any interest received thereon and reduced by reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such refund) promptly shall be paid to the Borrower to the extent payment has been made in full by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.19.

Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

We have acted as counsel for PMI in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

We have also examined the originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of PMI, certificates of public officials and of officers of PMI and agreements, instruments and other documents, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established by us, relied upon the representations of PMI set forth in the Credit Agreement and upon certificates of PMI or its officers or of public officials. Whenever the phrase "to our knowledge" is used herein, it refers to the actual knowledge of the attorneys of the firm involved in the representation of PMI in connection with the Credit Agreement, without independent investigation. We have assumed the due execution
and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as Facility Agent and Swingline Agent, and J.P. Morgan plc, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Lehman Brothers Inc., as Mandated Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners.
Our opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the Federal law of the United States.
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the following opinion:
1. PMI is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
2. The execution, delivery and performance by PMI of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within PMI's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to PMI (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (iii) to our knowledge, any contractual restriction binding on or affecting PMI. The Credit Agreement and any Notes delivered on the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of PMI.
3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by PMI of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
4. The Credit Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of PMI enforceable against PMI in accordance with its terms. The Notes issued on the date hereof, if any, are the legal, valid and binding obligations of PMI, enforceable against PMI in accordance with their respective terms.
The opinion set forth in paragraph 4 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
We express no opinion with respect to:
(A) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement which is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing by the parties thereto;
(B) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
 
(C) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement imposing penalties or forfeitures;
(D) The enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; or
(E) The effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.
In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement which relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that under NYCPLR  510, a New York State court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action from one Federal court to another.
This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(iii) of the Credit Agreement, is solely for the benefit of you and your counsel, and is not intended for, and may not be relied upon by, any other person or entity without our prior written consent.

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(iv) of the Credit Agreement. Terms used herein which are defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined a copy of the Credit Agreement signed by the Company and by the Facility and Swingline Agent and the Lenders.
We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records, agreements, instruments and other documents and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions expressed herein. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the representations made in the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
In rendering the opinion set forth below we have assumed that (1) the Credit Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Lenders parties thereto, (2) the Company is duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and of each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or ownership of its property makes such qualification necessary, has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and By-laws or other similar organizational documents, and (3)(a) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not contravene its Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or other similar organizational documents, (b) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not violate, or require any consent not obtained under, the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or any other applicable laws or regulations or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or other governmental authority binding on the Company, and (c) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not constitute a breach or violation of, or require any consent not obtained under, any agreement or instrument which is binding upon the Company.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
We express no opinion with respect to:
(A) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement which is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing by the parties thereto;
(B) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
(C) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement imposing penalties or forfeitures;
(D) the enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; or

In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement which relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that under NYCPLR  510, a New York State court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action from one Federal court to another.

This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above described transaction. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
