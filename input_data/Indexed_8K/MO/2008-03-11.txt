Exhibit 99.2
 
Good morning and welcome everyone.
I'm Nick Rolli, Vice President Investor Relations and Financial Communications for Altria. Following the spin-off, I will head up Investor Relations for Philip Morris International and Cliff Fleet, who is also here this morning, will head up Investor Relations for Altria. As we approach the distribution date, we will communicate our new contact information to investors and the news media.
Earlier this morning, we issued a news release which contains information about today's presentations. You may access a copy on our website at .

After opening remarks from Louis Camilleri, Altria's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Altria and PMI will each give presentations followed by a Q&A session.
We are providing an audio webcast of today's meeting and it is available on our website and will be archived until April 9, 2008.

Additional information about the spin-off of PMI, including answers to frequently asked questions, is already available on a special section of the website at www.altria.com/pmispinoff. On your way out today, we will also make available hard copies of the remarks from each presentation.
Before we begin, a few housekeeping items:
 
 
Altria and PMI's presentations contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement at the end of today's news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.

Today's presentations may contain various operating results on both a reported basis and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results.

It's my pleasure to now introduce Louis Camilleri, Altria's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Exhibit 99.3
 
 
Thank you, Nick. It's a pleasure to be here and thank you all for coming.
I would like to begin by outlining what will be covered in today's presentations, and who will speak on each topic.
My introductory remarks will address the remaining timeline and touch on some key points related to the forthcoming spin-off of Philip Morris International.
Mike Szymanczyk and Dave Beran will then present the new Altria' that will emerge after the spin-off.
Mike will review Altria's strategies for achieving sustainable long-term growth and reveal Altria's shareholder return targets going forward.
Dave will discuss Altria's productivity initiatives and financial strategy to deliver consistent and substantial shareholder return.
Mike and Dave will then take your questions.
Following our break, I will return to introduce our review of PMI, which will include presentations by Andr Calantzopoulos and Hermann Waldemer.
Andr will discuss PMI's growth strategies and opportunities with a particular focus on our plans for our key brands.
Hermann will review PMI's productivity initiatives, as well as our plans to exploit the strength of PMI's balance sheet and its growing cash flow to enhance shareholder returns. We will then field your questions.
As I stated in August, I firmly believe that PMI's impending separation from Altria will enhance growth and shareholder value by providing:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The distribution will be made on March 28, 2008, to Altria shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. New York City Time on March 19, 2008.
Altria will distribute one share of PMI stock for every share of Altria common stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m. New York City Time on the record date.
Trading will begin for PMI stock on March 31, 2008, on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PM", while Altria will continue trading under the symbol "MO".
Altria will begin mailing an Information Statement to all holders of Altria common stock as of the record date. Included in the Information Statement are the procedures by which the distribution will be effected and other details of the transaction, together with comprehensive data on PMI.
With the completion of the spin-off later this month, the diversified consumer products conglomerate that was built over four decades, and became the world's most profitable consumer products company, will no longer exist as we have known it.
In its place will be three independent, focused and thriving entities . . . the already-independent Kraft Foods, the soon-to-be independent Philip Morris International and the new Altria.
All three are in the top-ten list of the most profitable global consumer products companies, based on the latest available data, and I firmly believe that all three are poised to accelerate their growth momentum in the years ahead.
 
Over the five-year period from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2007, Altria's total shareholder return, including Kraft throughout, was 181.8%, a four-and-a-half fold increase versus the S&P 500 return of 40.4% during the same period.
Although the overall market has been severely depressed to-date, Altria  down about 1%  has actually held up remarkably well when compared to the S&P 500  down nearly 13%.
Over the same five-year period, our market capitalization increased by $123 billion, to reach a pro-forma level of approximately $206 billion at year-end 2007, including Kraft . . . placing us at number seven among the S&P 500 companies by market capitalization in 2007, also including Kraft.
Today is not about the past, but the future . . . and I want to assure you that our relentless focus on growth and returns to shareholders will continue going forward. We have maintained a pristine balance sheet, and our projections for 2008 earnings per share growth rates are robust.
For the full-year 2008, Altria forecasts diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will grow approximately 9% to 11% from a 2007 adjusted base of $1.50, excluding PMI, which will be accounted for as a discontinued operation.
PMI forecasts full-year 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will grow approximately 12% to 14% at prevailing January exchange rates, from a 2007 pro-forma adjusted base of $2.78.
These forecasts exclude the impact of any potential future acquisitions or divestitures, Altria's approximately $400 million pre-tax gain on the sale of its headquarters in New York City, $400 million in pre-tax charges related to the tender offer for Altria's notes and a number of other factors detailed in our 2007 year-end news release.
We have announced dividend policies, initial dividend rates and share repurchase programs for Altria and PMI post-spin, and these will be discussed in more detail by Dave and Hermann.
Before proceeding, I want to say a few words about the other speakers today . . . Mike, Andr, Dave and Hermann.
As you know, Mike will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria, following my resignation from those positions to serve in a similar role at PMI. I have known Mike and worked closely with him for more than 12 years, and have the highest regard for his immense business acumen, intellect, courage and leadership qualities. I
 
have no doubt that he will flourish in his new role and lead Altria to ever-greater heights. Mike has been the Chief Executive Officer of PM USA since 1997, having joined the company in 1990 as Senior Vice President of Sales. Prior to that he had extensive consumer products experience at P&G and Kraft, particularly in sales and marketing.
I am delighted that Andr has agreed to serve as Chief Operating Officer of PMI, reporting to me. Andr has served as President and CEO of PMI since March 2002. I actually hired Andr back in 1985 and he has since worked extensively across Central Europe before becoming President of the Eastern Europe region in 1999. Andr is an engineer by background and complements this with a creative flair and drive for results. I could not select a better partner to guide PMI going forward.
Following the spin-off, Altria and PMI will be blessed with what I would characterize as two "accomplished and complete" chief financial officers. Indeed, both Dave and Hermann have built on their vast financial experience with operational roles and each of them has accumulated a thorough understanding of our businesses and industry.
Dave will serve as Chief Financial Officer for the new Altria. He joined the company in 1976. He assumed his current position as PM USA's CFO in July 2007, and before that was executive vice president for finance, planning and information from 2005. He served as executive vice president of strategy, communications and consumer contact from 2002 to 2005, and was PM USA's Senior Vice President of Operations from 2000 through 2002.
Hermann will serve as CFO of PMI. He assumed his current position in September 2005. He was previously President of PMI's Western Europe region, and prior to that, was Managing Director of France and then Germany in a career at PMI that has spanned 21 years.
This is essentially my last public engagement in my current capacity and, accordingly, I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude for your keen interest and support during the last six challenging and exciting years during which I had the privilege to lead Altria.
We have had our fair share of highs and lows, but they have definitely been thrilling and rewarding years, and I am proud of what the company has achieved in this period. I look forward to an exciting future at PMI and to witnessing the growth of the new Altria in the years ahead.
And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mike

Altria Group, Inc. Investor Presentation
New York, NY
March 11, 2008
These remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. Please direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
[Remarks by Mr. Szymanczyk]
Thank you Louis and thank you for joining us today.
I am joined by several members of our future senior management team who I will introduce in a moment. As a team, we are very happy to see those of you who have followed Altria closely for a long time, as well as those of you who are newer to our business. We view today's discussion as an important first step in developing a relationship with each of you. We have tremendous opportunities before us and we are excited to share our vision with you today.
I would like to introduce you to a new Altria, a company that after the Philip Morris International (PMI) spin-off will provide substantial value to shareholders through its superior brands and leadership in the U.S. tobacco industry. When the spin-off of PMI is completed, our overriding goal will be to continue to build on our strong track record as a consistent performer, driving substantial, long-term total shareholder return.
Today, we will review with you Altria's formula for achieving sustainable long-term growth, as well as the operating strategy that underpins our performance, including how we manage our relationship with society. We will share with you our observations on the external tobacco environment. Finally, we will discuss Altria's financial strategy, including our plans for effective cost management, which we expect will enable the company to deliver consistent and substantial total shareholder return.
I believe Altria's scale, market position, balance sheet strength and improved operational focus make us one of the most compelling investment opportunities available in tobacco and consumer products.
Following the spin-off of PMI, we will have greater focus, with most of our corporate resources directed toward building our leadership position in the U.S. tobacco industry. The U.S. tobacco industry remains one of the largest and most profitable markets in the world, and has additional growth opportunities for Altria. Altria will have the ability to leverage resources, such as PM USA's distribution network and strong field sales force, across an array of tobacco products including acquisitions like John Middleton, Inc. We will also have a more flexible capital structure.
 
Following the PMI spin-off, Altria will maintain its historic strengths of a strong commitment and ability to deliver consistent and attractive return to our shareholders over the long-term; a stable of strong brands; continued efforts to responsibly address society's concerns about controversial products; and an experienced, motivated and capable management team.
Following the spin-off of PMI, Altria will remain a large business. PM USA will be the largest component of the company with its focus on domestic sales of cigarettes and adjacent products such as moist smokeless tobacco (MST) and Snus. John Middleton, Inc. was acquired in December of 2007, and is one of the leading manufacturers of machine-made large cigars with the powerful brand. Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) is a financial services business that is not making new investments, but is managing a portfolio of assets in order to maximize financial contributions to Altria. Altria also has a 28.6% interest in SABMiller, and this investment has performed well over the past few years.
Black & Mild
Now, let me introduce you to our new Altria Board of Directors. The Altria Board of Directors post-spin will include four continuing members from the current Altria Board of Directors, who have served on our Board for an average of 15 years. These continuing Board members are Elizabeth E. Bailey, Robert E.R. Huntley, Thomas W. Jones and George Muoz. They will be joined by four new directors: Thomas F. Farrell II, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dominion Resources, Inc., Gerald L. Baliles, Director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and former Governor of Virginia, Dinyar S. Devitre, who will step down as Chief Financial Officer of Altria following the spin, and myself. We are very fortunate to have such a talented and diverse board that brings both strong experience and new perspectives.
I'd like to also introduce you to our experienced management team. While some members of our team may be new to you, we have all been associated with the Altria family of companies for many years and have been deeply involved in running and growing its businesses.
Denise Keane, who is here today, will be our General Counsel. She has been the General Counsel of PM USA since 2001 and has been with the Altria family of companies for thirty years. She has been engaged in the successful management of our litigation issues in the preceding years, and has experience managing regulatory issues at the global level.
Also joining us today is Murray Garnick who will assume direct responsibility for managing smoking and health litigation as the Senior Vice President of Litigation. Murray, who was a senior partner at Arnold & Porter,has representedthe company in a wide variety of complex cases over the past twenty years.
 
 
Marty Barrington, who is also here today, will be our Chief Compliance and Administrative Officer. Marty previously served as General Counsel of both PMI and PM USA following several leadership positions at PM USA and with Altria, and has been with the company since 1993.
 
Howard Willard will be our Executive Vice President for Strategy and Business development. He will oversee John Middleton, Inc. and Philip Morris Duty Free, Inc. and is also responsible for new business development. Howard has sixteen years of experience in Finance, Sales, Information Services and Corporate Responsibility at PM USA and brings a background in management and finance.

Jack was previously President of Philip Morris International and Philip Morris USA, and has carried out leadership positions in Manufacturing, R&D, Planning and Corporate Affairs. He has been with the company for twenty-five years.
Craig Johnson will continue to serve as Executive Vice President of Sales and Brand Management for Philip Morris USA, a position he has held since 2005. Craig has been with PM USA for sixteen years, holding senior leadership positions in our sales organization, and has extensive experience in the consumer packaged goods industry at Procter & Gamble as well as Frito-Lay.
Nancy Lund will be the Senior Vice President of Marketing servicing all the Altria companies.

Nancy has been the key steward of the brand for over twenty years, and is one of the people most responsible for continuing success.

John Mulligan has served as President of PMCC since 2001. John has more than twenty years experience with PMCC and has held a variety of positions within the company with responsibility for new business generation, strategic portfolio initiatives and overseas business development.
This team, along with the rest of our organization, is excited about the future of Altria.
The company will be directed by a new Altria corporate mission, which is supported by four core strategies. These strategies will focus organizational energy to create significant value. Our mission is to own and develop financially disciplined businesses that are leaders in responsibly providing adult tobacco consumers with superior branded products. Altria's mission begins with leadership. The company will continue to invest in developing the leadership capabilities of its people and in leading brands. In order to maintain a license to operate, Altria has to assure it is aligned with society by addressing societal concerns that are relevant to its business. And of course, in order to compete effectively, Altria must satisfy adult consumers by understanding them and designing products that meet their evolving preferences better than competitors. If we are successful in achieving these first three goals, Altria will accomplish the fourth goal, which is to create substantial total shareholder return.
We are committed to achieving the following specific financial goals over the next several years:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We believe we can achieve these financial goals:
 
 
 
 
I have told you what we believe we can do. Let me tell you why.
Let's start with the cigarette business. The cigarette industry is a very large business with an estimated $70 billion in consumer expenditures in 2007. It is also very profitable with an estimated industry profit pool of $8.8 billion in pre-tax income. And, Philip Morris USA captured approximately 56% of this profit pool in 2007. Premium brands continue to gain share, led by .
Marlboro
However, cigarette volumes continue to decline. PM USA estimates that industry volume declined about 4% in 2007 versus an historical decline rate of about 2%.
For the next few years, PM USA anticipates annual industry volume declines of about 2.5% to 3%.
PM USA believes that the increased 2007 volume decline was the result of higher pricing, driven in part by a $1 billion step-up in manufacturer payments to the states under the Master Settlement Agreement and a 15% increase in the weighted year-end average state cigarette excise tax. In 2007, ten states, including Texas, which represents a significant amount of
 
industry volume, increased their cigarette excise taxes. This drove the weighted year-end average state cigarette excise tax up 13 cents to $1.01, the largest increase since 2002.
PM USA's shipment volume in 2007 was down 4.6% on a reported basis, but the company estimates the underlying rate of decline was about 3.6% when adjusted for trade inventory and calendar differences. Over the last five years, PM USA's shipment volume has declined by an average of 1.8% per year, or less than the overall industry estimated decline rate of 2.4%.
PM USA partially offsets industry volume declines through a continuing strategy of balancing retail share and income growth. In 2007, total PM USA retail share increased 0.3 of a share point for the full year to 50.6% outpacing a slight gain at Lorillard and share loss at R.J. Reynolds. PM USA's share gains were driven by strong performance as well as a 0.1 retail share gain for , offset by slight declines for and . In this consolidating cigarette industry PM USA has the brands in the best position to grow share.

The portfolio is led by . More than a cigarette, this is the brand that stands for superior tobacco flavor. A brand built on an idea that resonates as well today, as it did when it was created decades ago. I must tell you it is not just we at Altria who are attached to country; adult cigarette smokers are too, and they vote every day all across this wide country.
Marlboro
Marlboro
is the leading cigarette brand in the United States. It is the number one cigarette brand in every state. It is the number one cigarette brand for men and women across all adult age groups. In 2007, gained 0.5 share point to a record 41% retail share, making it both the nation's largest and fastest growing cigarette brand. This share is larger than the combined share of the next ten largest cigarette brands, and larger than R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard combined.

Marlboro
Menthol is the industry's fastest growing menthol brand, gaining 0.5 retail share point in 2007. Menthol is the leading menthol brand in twenty-four states, and is the number two menthol brand in twenty-five other states. In 2007, Menthol's growth was driven by incremental share created by Smooth, a new menthol cigarette with a unique taste and design. Innovations like Smooth have played an important role in fueling the share growth of and Philip Morris USA.

Line extensions allow the company to meet changing adult smoker preferences, remain relevant in a dynamic marketplace, and grow retail share. It is also a strategy that PM USA executes well. For example, Philip Morris USA introduced six cigarette line extensions on from 2002 to 2007 that garnered more than two share points. Each retail share point represents an estimated $90 million in after-tax annual operating income. By comparison, over the same time period, R.J. Reynolds launched over ten new Camel line extensions with a gain of slightly more than a share point, while Newport had one line extension with minimal market share results.
Marlboro
is different than the brands with which it competes, and that calls for it to have a different competitive strategy. Let me explain. Competitive brands have geographic areas of strength. Newport is strong on the East Coast. The shaded states on the slide indicate where the brand's share is more than 25% above the brand's national average share. Camel is strong on the West Coast and the discount segment is strong in the Midwest and South.
Marlboro
 
Unlike competitors which have concentrated geographic areas of strength and spending, is the leading brand in every state and competes in all geographies. PM USA manages equity building programs, merchandising programs, promotions, and pricing strategies to compete nationally and in each of these different areas based on competitive activities. ability to compete at premium prices across all geographies makes it the industry's most profitable brand.
Marlboro

PM USA has other strong brands in its portfolio. , , and have areas of regional strength and PM USA builds their positions with smart and focused investment spending in these areas. These brands are very important to PM USA. They contributed over a half billion dollars in operating profit for the company in 2007.

PM USA's brand strength in the cigarette business forms the base for expansion into growing and adjacent tobacco categories. For example, PM USA is using superior tobacco flavor image and the resources that support the cigarette franchise to create value in new businesses such as Moist Smokeless Tobacco and Snus.
Marlboro's
Marlboro
Moist smokeless tobacco volumes are growing an estimated 5% a year. strong equity should allow it to capitalize on this category growth, as well as build share from current adult MST consumers. The brand has broad appeal among adult MST consumers as well as smokers. PM USA's research indicates that MST products fit with the brand image and adult MST consumers would be very interested in purchasing a branded product. Adult consumer research also indicates that MST product tests very well against competitive offerings. For these reasons, Philip Morris USA is testing MST in Atlanta, Georgia. PM USA is pleased with its initial results, and recently expanded the test market into additional counties surrounding Atlanta.

Research also indicates that many adult smokers are interested in smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes, but are not satisfied with existing alternatives like MST or chewing tobacco. Our research, along with learnings from Sweden, where a form of smokeless tobacco called snus has become a popular alternative for adult smokers, has led us to develop Snus.
Marlboro
Snus is a spit-free, smokeless tobacco pouch product designed especially for adult smokers. PM USA began testing Snus in Dallas, Texas in August of 2007 and began replacing its initial snus entry, Taboka, in Indianapolis, Indiana in January 2008. Based on consumer insights from Sweden, Indianapolis and Dallas, PM USA believes snus offers long term potential as an alternative product for adult smokers. We are continuing to apply the insights we are gaining from our consumer offerings in the test markets, and are optimistic about the future of Snus.

The smokeless tobacco category holds great promise for PM USA in the coming years. The combined test market results for the two products in stores stocking is an estimated 6% share of the smokeless tobacco categories, after only seven months into our test markets. While not yet nationally projectable, this result gives us reason for optimism.

Altria augmented its portfolio of strong brands and adjacency strategy in 2007 by entering the growing machine-made large cigar market with the acquisition of John Middleton, Inc. and its powerful brand.

Machine-made large cigar volumes have been growing at an estimated rate of 4% to 5% per year. is a leading machine-made large cigar brand in the country with a 2007 retail share of 25.3%, an increase of 2.2 share points from the prior year. The five pack is the best selling machine-made large cigar package. does not have an entry in what is characterized as the small cigar category. tested number one in our research on the following characteristics versus competitive brands: Aroma, Value, Freshness, Taste and Tobacco Quality. Altria believes that John Middleton can continue to grow share and the income delivered by the highly profitable brand by leveraging the resources that support PM USA's cigarette business.

For the full year 2007, John Middleton's volume, revenues net of excise taxes and operating companies income were in line with estimates provided when the acquisition was announced on November 1, 2007. While these results were not material to Altria in 2007 given the mid-December closing of the acquisition, the company looks forward to building on John Middleton's success.
In 2005, Altria's U.S. tobacco business had one core product, cigarettes. As of today, we continue to build the base cigarette business, and have added exciting new products in emerging and growing categories like , Snus and Moist Smokeless Tobacco.

We have strong brands that are being leveraged into adjacent tobacco categories, and powerful infrastructure to support them that continues to fuel Altria's formidable financial strength. Altria's 2007 underlying operating income from continuing operations excluding PMI was $5.0 billion, with operating cash flow of $3.3 billion, which excludes the return of the escrow bond deposits related to the case.

Underlying our brand and category building efforts are two key areas of infrastructure that represent critical competitive advantages for the company. The first is insight and innovation, which encompasses consumer research as well as research and development. It is the company's strength in these areas that produced Smooth and several other new cigarette line extensions in 2007. Smooth utilized a breakthrough menthol application process to create a uniquely different smoking experience.

Research and development and consumer insights enable PM USA to maintain industry leading design and quality. These investments assure that the product and packaging remain the industry's best. PM USA's research indicates that adult consumers continue to rate it as the highest quality cigarette on the market today.

Strong research and development has also enabled PM USA to organically develop new smokeless products. Insights from the test markets for these products will inform future development efforts.
 
To support its research agenda, PM USA has recently consolidated its activities into a new state of the art facility in Richmond, Virginia that will enhance innovation, collaboration and further increase its understanding of adult consumer preferences. As a part of transitioning into this new facility, PM USA is redesigning many of its research and consumer insight gathering processes to increase innovation at lower cost.
The second area of infrastructure that is key to our success is the ability to connect with adult tobacco consumers. PM USA connects with adult tobacco consumers in two ways: through the in-store experience and the development of one-to-one relationships, and Altria plans to leverage these resources across the broader company.
Every month, the PM USA field sales force calls on over 250,000 retail stores that sell cigarettes, and works with retailers to promote our brands in a focused and responsible way. In 2007, PM USA made over 4 million sales calls to build the business and support our customers. This infrastructure creates a strategic advantage for responsible expansion into new products.
PM USA also uses an extensive database to create one-to-one relationships with adult tobacco consumers. This database has the names of over 25 million adult cigarette smokers, and reaches adult tobacco consumers who wish to receive promotional offers and information from our brands.
This database will also support expansion into other products that are appealing to adult tobacco consumers.
PM USA also invests in innovative, brand-building equity programs. These programs are probably not visible to you, because they are efficiently aimed solely at adult tobacco consumers. Let me give you a feel for some of these programs with this short video. These equity building programs enhance the long-term strength of a brand and make connections with adult tobacco consumers that can be leveraged in many ways.
Our brands, the infrastructure that supports them, and our financial strength will provide shareholder return only if we maintain a license to operate in society. Like many other companies, Altria is working to understand society's expectations and effectively address concerns where appropriate. The company believes that doing so is essential to deliver shareholder return in the long term, and we strive to be a leader in this area just as we strive for leadership in other aspects of our business.
For example, PM USA has built programs to address both underage use and smoking cessation in recent years. PM USA supports programs to prevent youth access at retail and promote positive youth development programs addressing a range of risky behaviors. PM USA believes that these efforts, as well as the efforts of many others, have contributed to the declines in youth smoking. Youth smoking rates have declined by 63% among 8
th
graders and 49% among 10
th
graders since 1998. Among 12
th
graders, smoking rates have declined by 38% since 1998.
PM USA also recognizes that there are smokers who wish to stop using its products and may have a difficult time quitting. The company believes that when consumers decide to quit, it has a role to play in helping connect smokers to expert resources.
 
Of course, our brands and the infrastructure that supports them are only as good as the people behind them. Altria has a long history of attracting, developing and retaining top talent across its operating companies, and PM USA's successful programs in these areas will be the foundation of our future practices. PM USA's efforts have been recognized by those outside of our organization. In September of 2007 Business Week Magazine ranked PM USA among the top 50 places to start a career for the second consecutive year. And for the fifth consecutive year, PM USA ranked in the top 50 of Computer World's 100 best places to work in Information Technology. One reflection of the effectiveness of PM USA's efforts is an enviable annual employee retention rate of 95%.
I've talked a lot about investing and building, but as I've mentioned our primary business, the cigarette business, is consolidating. That means Altria has to find creative ways to accomplish its objectives at lower costs. Going forward, we will do more for less, over a billion dollars less than in 2006. Dave Beran will provide details on our cost reduction plans in a few moments.
So these are the reasons why we believe we can meet the financial goals I have outlined:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before Dave Beran comes up, I'd like to make just a few comments on the external tobacco environment. As you know, Altria has supported tough but reasonable federal regulation of tobacco products by the FDA for over seven years. We believe that such tough but reasonable federal regulation can benefit shareholders:
 
 
 
 
Work on this subject continues in Congress and we are engaged in this process. At this time, it is not clear if legislation that gives the FDA authority to formulate and administer tough but reasonable regulations will be enacted, but we remain committed to securing these benefits for our consumers and shareholders.
Going forward, Altria also remains committed to defending itself in the courtroom. We continue to vigorously defend the claims brought against us and will not deviate from this fundamental approach.
In 2007, the litigation environment, while challenging, continued to improve. Setting the case aside for a moment, the trend line for individual smoking and health claims shows a sharp downward trend. Since 1997, 1,175 individual cases have been served. Of these, only five resulted in verdicts that were upheld on appeal and paid.
Engle
Class action suits filed against PM USA are also declining. Since 2004, only three new class actions have been served in contrast to 1997 and 2002 when 28 class actions were served in each year. Today, the vast majority of class actions filed against PM USA have been dismissed or are inactive. Of the so-called "Lights" class actions over the past few years, the great majority are no longer active cases. Many have been dismissed either voluntarily or involuntarily. Indeed, more and more courts are denying class certification or rejecting the claims. Still other cases remain dormant. As of today, three statewide "Lights" class action cases have been certified  , , and .
Craft
Curtis
Aspinall
In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has granted review in one statewide "Lights" class action  the case  to resolve the question of whether federal law preempts these claims in their entirety. The case will be heard in the fall of 2008 and we look forward to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 2009. As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's upcoming review in , we expect the three certified cases to be stayed or delayed and we expect little movement in any statewide "Lights" case until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules.
Good
Good
Let me briefly mention the status of the case, which is a nationwide "Lights" class action. As you know, the case is stayed and the class certification order is under review by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. We look forward to the Second Circuit's decision reviewing that order.
Schwab
Turning for a moment to the case, as you know, in 2006, the Florida Supreme Court decertified the class and reversed the $145 billion punitive damage award against PM USA and other defendants, but allowed former class members to file individual lawsuits by January 11, 2008. PM USA's current tally is that about 8,000 plaintiffs have filed claims  slightly more than 1% of the estimated 700,000 potential class members.
Engle
We do not believe that these progeny cases will be any more successful than other smoking and health cases. Plaintiffs must still prove key elements of their claims at trial, including causation, reliance, and damages. Further, PM USA has strong legal and appellate challenges to these suits.
Engle
 
With respect to the trial court's judgment in the United States' civil RICO case which resulted in no monetary damage award, we remain confident that the appeal will demonstrate why the decision is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law. No decision on the appeal is expected before 2009.
To summarize, over the past several years, the number of individual smoking and health claims served, other than claims, has declined by 92%, the number of pending class actions has declined approximately 55%, and the amount of damages in appeals against the company has declined by over 99%. In short, PM USA's litigation environment, while still challenging, has improved and remains stable. PM USA has vigorously defended claims brought against it for decades and this approach will not change in the future.
Engle
Now, I would like to introduce Dave Beran, Altria's Chief Financial Officer - elect, who will take us through an overview of the company's 2007 business and financial performance, as well as our plans to deliver superior shareholder return.
[]
Remarks by Mr. Beran
Thank you, Mike. Let's review Altria's 2007 business performance and financial strategy.
In 2007, total shareholder return for all of Altria was 22.2%, which outpaced the return of the Altria Peer Group at 20.9%, and was significantly higher than the S&P 500, which had a return of 5.5%.
In 2007, Altria had another strong year and delivered superior shareholder return. Revenues net of excise taxes from continuing businesses excluding PMI were $15.2 billion, and underlying operating income was $5.0 billion.
In 2007, PMCC's reported operating companies income was $421 million versus $176 million for the full year 2006. Results for 2007 included cash recoveries of $214 million related to certain airline leases previously written down, versus a provision of $103 million in 2006. PMCC will remain focused on managing its portfolio of leased assets to maximize gains and cash flow from earning assets, as well as asset sales and terminations. PMCC is not making new investments and expects that its operating income will vary over time as investments mature or are sold.
Altria's investment in SABMiller continued to grow in value last year. Since the transaction creating this investment, the market value on a pre-tax basis has grown from $3.4 billion to $9.0 billion as of the end of February 2008. Altria currently plans to maintain this investment while regularly evaluating ways to maximize its value to our shareholders.
While we are pleased with our results during 2007, Altria recognizes that future shareholder value will be delivered differently than in the past. Altria plans to meet the objective of delivering 12% or better total shareholder return in three ways: through revenue growth, effective cost management, and the prudent use of the balance sheet.
As Mike described, revenue growth will come by effectively leveraging Altria's sustainable business advantages and growing market share and income in the base cigarette business while
 
supporting expansion into adjacent categories. PM USA plans to continue prudently managing the core cigarette business to achieve moderate share and income growth. Altria also plans to accelerate growth outside of its core. The introduction of Snus, MST, and the acquisition of John Middleton, Inc., all in the second half of 2007, are tangible examples of these plans. Altria expects to drive revenue growth in the low single digits per year, driven by price and share gains in the cigarette business as well as expansion into adjacent categories.
Marlboro
Marlboro
Altria is disciplined in its approach to growth and recognizes that it is sometimes appropriate to consider acquisitions as a way to grow. Altria will continue to target potential acquisitions that allow us to leverage company strengths at an attractive price that will allow us to meet our internal financial hurdle rates. Altria will continue analyzing the strategic trade-offs of building vs. buying', recognizing that we have an unparalleled national platform with the leading brand.
Effective cost management is the second tool that will enable Altria to deliver superior shareholder return.
Over the last decade PM USA has steadily reduced headcount in line with cigarette volume declines. Since 1998, headcount has been reduced at the company by 26%. PM USA has a history of removing large pieces of infrastructure in order to respond to changes in the business. In 1998, the Stockton Street cigarette factory was closed. In 2000, the company ceased production at its Louisville cigarette production facility. The PM USA headquarters' staff moved to Richmond, Virginia in 2003 and 2004, and last June the company announced the closure of its Cabarrus North Carolina manufacturing facility.
During this time, the company made strategic investments, building capability in order to deal with emerging issues and to optimize future earnings potential. These areas included youth smoking prevention, corporate responsibility and research and development. The bulk of the spending to develop and expand these programs is behind us. Now we are taking steps to improve their operating efficiencies while maintaining their effectiveness.
Today, we are announcing an additional $300 million in new selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense reductions that will be achieved over the next several years. These cost reductions are in addition to PM USA's 2007 efficiency initiatives that reduced SG&A expenses by 12%, or over $300 million. This brings the total cost reduction to $600 million. This dollar amount is over 24% of the SG&A expenses for the company.
PM USA also expects to deliver ongoing annual savings of $156 million beginning in 2011, as a result of the consolidation and optimization of its cigarette manufacturing operations in Richmond, Virginia. We anticipate charges related to this initiative of approximately $670 million from 2007 through 2011.
Altria expects to deliver $250 million in ongoing annual savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the corporate restructuring. We anticipate one-time charges related to the spin-off and restructuring in 2008, offset by an estimated gain of $400 million from the planned sale of Altria's New York headquarters in 2008.
 
These cost reduction programs are expected to deliver savings of over one billion dollars on an annual basis by 2011 off the 2006 cost base. As we manage these efforts, our companies will continue to identify further cost reductions and look for opportunities to accelerate planned productivity enhancements.
Our third tool is effective and efficient use of the balance sheet to create value. Altria's solid balance sheet gives us great flexibility. We are committed to both using this flexibility to create value for shareholders, and maintaining this flexibility. Altria plans to prudently manage the balance sheet to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings.
In connection with the spin-off of PMI, Altria completed its bond tender offer and has purchased for cash approximately 2.3 billion of U.S. dollar notes and debentures and approximately 400 million in euro-denominated bonds. In order to finance the tender offer, Altria arranged a $4.0 billion bridge loan facility. Altria intends to access the public-debt market to replace the debt retired as a result of the tender offer. The tender offer will result in pre-tax charges of approximately $400 million in the first quarter of 2008. Of the $400 million, approximately $100 million is premium and approximately $300 million is the estimated mark to market value reflecting lower interest rates.
Altria generates approximately $3.5 billion of operating cash flow per year, which represents a conversion of approximately 65% of our EBITDA into cash, and we are committed to returning a large majority of this cash flow to our shareholders. We also expect capital expenditures to remain relatively low and under 3% of revenues net of excise taxes.
Altria expects to commence a share repurchase program of $7.5 billion over two years. We plan to begin this program in April of this year and this is only one part of the cash that will be returned to shareholders. Altria's dividend is another important component of the cash return.
Overall, Altria plans to return over $12 billion to our shareholders over the next two years in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This planned cash return is greater than the cash return to shareholders of almost all other consumer packaged goods companies in 2006 and 2007, and is over five times more than the cash returned from Reynolds American and Lorillard in that time period. Altria also will maintain adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of any future opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
Altria's guidance for 2008 is the result of our strategy to deliver shareholder value:
 
 
We expect earnings per share growth to be stronger in the second half of 2008. This is a transition year for Altria, as we deal with the spin-off of PMI and associated accounting, costs, and effects of the removal of PMI volume from PM USA manufacturing facilities.
However, Altria plans to continue profit growth by increasing revenues and expanding operating margins as cost reduction programs take full effect. Altria anticipates underlying annual EPS
 
growth averaging 8% to 10% over the next several years starting in 2009 which, when combined with our dividend, should result in total shareholder return in excess of 12% annually.
We believe the combination of our size and stability, as well as the magnitude of total shareholder return available makes Altria a very compelling investment opportunity.
I will now turn it back over to Mike to close.
[]
Remarks by Mr. Szymanczyk
Thanks, Dave. Our company is in a great position to deliver 12% or better total shareholder return going forward.
 
 
 
 
We believe the combination of these four elements year to year will produce the 12% or better goal we have set.
On behalf of our management team, I will conclude by saying that we are very excited about the opportunity we have to build on Altria's solid track record while growing this business in a responsible way that creates additional value for you, Altria's shareholders.
 

Exhibit 99.5
Remarks by Andr Calantzopoulos and Hermann Waldemer, who will become Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of PMI, respectively, following the spin-off of Philip Morris International Inc.
[Remarks by Mr. Camilleri]
1) Andr Calantzopoulos, Hermann Waldemer and I are delighted to be here on the eve of PMI becoming an independent public company. We, together with our 75,000 employees, are genuinely excited by our future growth prospects and determined to fulfill our promise and to further build upon our former parent's exceptional shareholder return legacy.
2) Our review of PMI will be split into three parts.
I will first introduce you to PMI's Board of Directors and senior leadership team and share with you our ambitions and aspirations for PMI and our longer term growth targets.
3) Andr will review how we intend to leverage PMI's unparalleled strengths and resources, and focus on the operational strategies that we will pursue to deliver these targets.
4) Hermann will conclude by reviewing our productivity initiatives, and our plans to exploit the strength of our balance sheet and our growing cash flow to enhance shareholder returns.
5) One of Altria's historical hallmarks has always been the quality and shareholder value focus of its Board of Directors and its senior leadership team. PMI will undoubtedly share this characteristic going forward.
6) As Altria announced in January, PMI's Board of Directors will include five former independent Altria Board members, who have served the company for an average of 13 years each and who are therefore intimately familiar with the intricacies of PMI's business and prospects.
7) Three new members will join them on the Board. They are Graham Mackay, Chief Executive Officer of SABMiller, Sergio Marchionne, Chief Executive Officer of the Fiat Group, and Carlos
 
Slim Hel, who had served on the Altria Board for approximately ten years, from 1997 to 2006.
Together they represent a formidable Board with vast complementary skills and expertise to guide us in the years ahead.
8) Our senior management team is shown on this slide. Some are unknown to you, but I am sure that as the months and years unfold you will get to meet most, if not all, of them. They collectively hail from 11 different countries, have had an average tenure with the Altria group of companies of 20 years, and all share a common passion for this wonderful company. Indeed, I could not hope to assemble a more talented, committed, growth-oriented and appropriately ambitious leadership team.
You should also know that we are blessed with a depth of management talent that goes way beyond these 15 individuals. While they today represent the icing on the cake, rest assured that there is an entire new generation of highly talented, young leaders who will propel PMI to ever greater heights in the years and decades to come.
9) PMI will shortly open a new chapter in its history which, as you all know, has been marked by an enviable track record of success.
Over the last twenty years, PMI's shipment volume has grown at a compound annual rate of 4.8%, while underlying operating companies income has surged at a compound annual rate of 13.1%.
10) Our more recent history parallels this strong performance. Over the 2003 to 2007 period, cigarette shipment volume has grown at a compound annual rate of 3.7% and revenues, net of excise taxes, at a rate of 9.3%. Reported operating income has increased at an annual rate of 9.5%, while reported net earnings have increased by $2 billion or 50% over this four-year period, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of close to 11%.
11) The drivers of this strong income performance have been pricing, currency and acquisitions, partially offset by adverse volume/mix of some $900 million, and higher expenditures behind sales, marketing, R&D and administration of $800 million. The
 
adverse mix component of our earnings variance predominantly reflects a shift in geographic mix, as more of our growth has been generated by markets that yield lower, but nevertheless attractive, margins.
12) A frequent and legitimate complaint that we often hear from investors and that we wholeheartedly share, is that our organic volume/mix performance has lagged expectations. Another concern, often quoted in the same breath, is that PMI's presence and performance in emerging markets is insufficiently significant.
Let me address both issues.
It is an undeniable fact that our volume performance in several developed markets has suffered from a combination of adverse fiscal, regulatory and competitive developments that have simultaneously affected total cigarette consumption levels and put the premium segment we lead under pressure. Despite these headwinds, our performance in the 29 member countries of the OECD, excluding the United States, has been resilient. While our cigarette shipment volume has declined by 8% since 2003, OCI has increased by 29%, highlighting our ability to grow profitability in declining markets.
13) In non-OECD markets, a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions has enabled us to achieve a 48% increase in cigarette shipment volume over the same period and we have more than doubled our OCI.
14) Our share performance has been solid even in mature markets. Our share of OECD markets, excluding the USA, has grown by 1.2 share points to reach a level of 33.5%, while our share of non-OECD markets has increased by 5.3 share points to a total share of 20%.
15) As a result, we have achieved a very good geographic balance with slightly more than half our volume being generated outside the generally more mature OECD markets. These of course remain highly and increasingly profitable and the split in profitability is about two thirds OECD and one third non-OECD.
 
16) Could we have done better? Possibly. Can we going forward? Certainly, as Andr will shortly demonstrate to you.
Many of the issues that converged in several important markets to dampen our overall pace of growth are largely behind us and, importantly, we see nothing today on the horizon that we believe will have a dislocating impact of the magnitude we have had to swallow in the recent past.
This is a realistic expectation. The operating environment has improved significantly with governments more frequently adopting less discriminatory and fairer excise tax structures. In addition, we believe the competitive brand repositioning to lower price segments that we have witnessed is largely complete, partially resulting from a further wave of industry consolidation.
17) This less turbulent industry framework is also evidenced by our strong 2007 earnings performance and improving quarter to quarter operating momentum.
18) This brings me to our aspirations and ambitions for the future.
Quite simply, we aspire to deliver top-tier performance, not only within the tobacco industry, but within the broader, global consumer packaged goods industry. We believe that we can deliver strong, predictable and consistent growth benefiting, in part, from the attractive characteristics of our industry, which include solid pricing power, a cost base that is not prone to volatility in commodity costs, attractive margins and an inherent ability to generate strong cash flows. This will enable us to return significant amounts of cash through dividends and share repurchases to reward shareholders.
19) As announced in January, we project 2008 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 12% to 14% at the then prevailing exchange rates from a 2007 pro-forma adjusted base of $2.78.
20) Longer term, we target net revenue growth, net of excise taxes, of 4 to 6% a year on average with cigarette shipment volume increasing 1 to 2% a year; operating income growth of 6 to 8% a year on average; and EPS growth in the range of 10 to 12% a year on average.
 
I trust thatat the conclusion of our presentationyou will share our belief that these targets, while appropriately ambitious, can be delivered in a predictable and consistent manner.
21) I know full well that setting such growth targets is one thing, delivering them is another. Andr and Hermann will now describe how we intend to do so and why we are confident in our ability to deliver.
Ultimately, our success depends on our people and our brands. I am convinced that we have the focus, discipline, passion, creativity and determination within our organization, as well as the financial wherewithal, to grow our unparalleled brand portfolio in the years ahead.
22) Andr 
[Remarks by Mr. Calantzopoulos]
Thank you Louis.
23) Let me begin by summarizing the distinct attributes that I believe PMI offers investors. These include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24) Over the last two years, we have taken a number of organizational and portfolio actions to enhance our growth.
We have implemented a consumer insights-driven innovation process, aimed at anticipating consumer expectations and regulatory trends and improving the flow of innovative products and marketing initiatives that we can deploy rapidly to many markets.
25) We have shifted decision power and appropriate resources to our markets and focused them on consumers, customers and regulators.
26) We have simplified and centralized key internal processes and continued to optimize our supply chain as Hermann will cover later.
27) We have redefined the architecture of our key brands and their role in the PMI portfolio and, as appropriate, modified packaging, product and positioning. All these improvements are being deployed or are ready to be deployed.
28) We have adapted the structure and mission of our field forces to the new brand requirements and drastically reduced back office activities.
29) We have redeployed resources to direct consumer work, whilst undertaking trade related activities that reinforce our position as category leader.
30) Our scale, distribution footprint and superior field forces give us a unique ability to bring products to consumers fast, and at the highest levels of Point of Sale visibility and availability.
31) Finally, we have re-allocated our resources and adapted our organizational structure in order to ensure that we are fully ready to operate as an independent company.
32) These important organizational improvements have been implemented with impressive enthusiasm, speed and discipline by our people. They have already yielded significant results in terms of
 
creativity, anticipation, speed, marketing mix effectiveness and productivity to sustain and further widen our leadership position.
33) This chart shows for 2006, the last year for which comparable data is at present fully available, that PMI is significantly larger in volume terms than not only BAT but also the now expanded Japan Tobacco and Imperial. Our volume was 20% higher than that of BAT and nearly three times that of Imperial and Altadis combined.
PMI's lead is even more apparent in terms of profitability with net earnings in 2006 equivalent to the combined net earnings of BAT and Japan Tobacco, including Gallaher.
We anticipate that this very positive picture will be maintained once final 2007 numbers are available for all companies.
34) Our geographic balance and our global reach have enabled us to develop strong market share positions in each of our four regional segments. PMI is the clear leader in the European Union, well ahead of the expanded Imperial.
In Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or "EEMA", we estimate that we are level with the expanded Japan Tobacco and are ahead of BAT in spite of our limited presence in sub-Saharan Africa.
In Asia, excluding China, we believe we became the industry leader in 2007 following our acquisition of Lakson Tobacco.
Finally, in Latin America, we are a strong number two. These regional shares not only outline our strengths, but also underscore the ample room for further growth.
35) In the top thirty markets by volume outside the USA, PMI has achieved market leadership in 11 and is number two in a further 8. We have highlighted in red the markets on this list which are not OECD members.
36) We are not only the leader in terms of key markets, but also the indisputable worldwide leader in brands. , with a 2007 volume of 311 billion units, is larger than the next three best selling
Marlboro
 
international brands combined and larger than the seven that follow them. Another comparison is that significantly outsells the total combined volume of all of BAT's Global Drive Brands. And if we were to single out Gold, it would be the second largest brand after Red.

38) This global leadership and presence is the foundation of our superior performance as it provides us with a comprehensive understanding of both global and individual market consumer trends.
39) We are able to reach our consumers through efficient distribution networks, supplemented by our excellent focused sales teams.
40) We generate economies of scale across the value chain of our industry, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and R&D.
41) The size of our key brands allows us to develop and implement impactful, global and cost-effective marketing programs.
42) Our superior infrastructure encompassing 160 countries provides us with an excellent platform for the geographic expansion of these brands.
43) We have the flexibility to redeploy our resources to those markets where the impact of such investments generates the highest returns.
 
44) And last but not least, our leading position in the higher margin premium segment creates tremendous operating cash flows which are key to generating superior returns for our shareholders.
45) We do not intend to rest on our laurels. We have put in place a comprehensive set of strategies to secure PMI's long-term growth. Enhanced consumer understanding and innovation will reinforce our brand portfolio and improve our volume and market share performance going forward.
46) We will expand geographically through new market penetration and acquisitions, such as our recent entries into Algeria and Bangladesh and our acquisitions in Colombia and Indonesia.
47) We will also reinforce our position in all profitable consumer segments, particularly those where we are currently under-represented.
48) We will continue to improve our margins through optimal pricing decisions.
49) We will seek a regulatory regime governing our industry that is comprehensive, fair, and science based and a fiscal regime that is equitable and reasonable.
50) We will boost our organizational effectiveness and speed to market and generate further productivity savings.
51) We will attract, motivate and retain the best global talent; and
52) Last, but by no means least, we will use our strong and increasing operating cash flow and balance sheet strength to offer increased shareholder returns beyond those that are generated by our earnings' growth alone, while retaining ample financial flexibility to further grow the business.
53) So what do we intend to do to enhance the performance of our terrific stable of brands?
 
Let me first outline the portfolio segment opportunities that we believe exist, to provide appropriate context to our new product plans and positioning. Our objective is to reinforce our leading position or address segments where we are currently under-represented.
Please keep in mind our 25.2% share of the international market excluding China as a reference.
54) We are the clear leaders in the premium segment, both in OECD and non-OECD markets excluding China, with some 50% segment share in both.
55) We have achieved a good base for further growth with a segment share of over 20% in the mid-price segment as well as in the low-price segment in OECD markets, where margins are attractive.
56) In terms of flavor segmentation, we have secured a strong position in the full flavor segment in OECD markets and in the "lights" segment worldwide. However, we are currently under-represented in the ultralight flavor segment in both OECD and non-OECD markets.
57) Menthol is a segment that we estimate has been growing at an annual rate of 3%. With a 38% menthol segment share in OECD markets and 28% overall, we are well placed to take advantage of this trend.
58) In terms of format, the traditional diameter cigarette remains the consumer favorite. However, there is an increasing consumer trend towards cigarettes with a slim or super-slim diameter in a number of markets, as highlighted on this slide.
59) Our brand portfolio strategy addresses these broad opportunities. Our top priority is to improve the performance of through innovation, and to reinforce our premium segment leadership, in particular in the lighter-taste segments.

unique flavor promise. It enjoys tremendous trust and respect. remains aspirational with an excellent demographic profile.
Marlboro
61) The demographic profile of a brand is an excellent measure of the brand's inherent aggregate strength. This chart compares 2007 smoker share in the Legal Age minimum 18 to 24 age group, which I will refer to as "Young Adult Smokers", shown in red, with the brand's overall smoker share, shown in blue. In all but one of these 12 key countries across our four geographic regions, namely Germany, the share difference is positive, which augurs well for outlook.

Marlboro's
62) Over the 2003 through 2007 period, volume decreased from 320 billion units to 311 billion, representing a 0.7% annual decline. While this is obviously unsatisfactory, it does provide proof of the brand's resilience given the magnitude of the difficulties we faced in several key markets as Louis mentioned earlier.
Marlboro
63) For example, excluding Germany alone, where sales dropped due to downtrading to much lower taxed other tobacco products, as well as low price cigarettes, the volume of shipments increased by 9 billion units. This represents an annual growth rate of 0.8%, driven by the brand's strong performance in emerging markets such as the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine.
Marlboro
Marlboro
64) Having said that, we recognize that we were slow to exploit participation in the growing trend towards lighter tasting cigarettes in certain Eastern European and Asian markets. Gold in particular was affected by the rich flavor perception of its parent in these markets.

65) In addition, although continues to outscore competitive brands on virtually all image attributes, consumers expect and want to be the industry innovator.

66) So what are our plans going forward?
A key strategy we will pursue is to establish more distinctive identities for Gold and Green. We will clearly differentiate

them from Red and increase their appeal to consumer groups and segments that has not traditionally addressed, while retaining unique characteristics and heritage.

68) Gold's positioning will be refined to become the brand that explores new dimensions in smoking and is progressive, open-minded, casually elegant, inventive and confident.

69) Green will be the brand that provides refreshing sensations, is easy-going and extroverted.
Marlboro
70) This new architecture will be established through appropriate packaging upgrades, line extensions, effective consumer communications and continued quality improvements.
We believe that these refinements will reinforce consumer appeal and enhance its growth prospects.

72) One of our first innovations was the development and roll out of . This is a shorter cigarette with a wider diameter that provides a smoother smoking experience. It is sold in the innovative "lighter pack" and is available in full flavor, "lights" and menthol variants. Based on what we have learnt since its launch, we are currently modifying certain product parameters of with a view to rolling out new variants later this year.

competitive brands. In the regions where we tested the brand, it rapidly achieved a 0.4 market share with modest cannibalization. We plan to role out into several additional markets during 2008.
Marlboro Intense
74) In Indonesia, we launched in a kretek version in June, in order to leverage the high awareness and prestige of the core franchise while responding to local taste preferences. Results so far are very good. This is the best performing premium kretek launch in many years. It achieved a 0.3% national share during the fourth quarter of 2007, with a regional high of 0.9% in East Java. Importantly, since the launch of the kretek variant, the rate of growth of the entire franchise has accelerated. The overall family reached a market share of 4.6% during the fourth quarter of 2007, a gain of 0.7 share points compared to the same period the previous year.

Marlboro Filter Plus
77) The brand has now been expanded to a further seven markets that are all characterized by a growing consumer trend towards lighter tasting products. Initial results are very positive. For example, achieved a monthly 0.8% market share in Moscow less than six months after its launch, and 0.6% in Kiev, one share point in Almaty and a 0.9% market share in Bucharest in just three months. Amongst Young Adult Smokers, the variant has already achieved smoker shares roughly double its market shares. Furthermore, consumer research in Russia indicates that the new variant has enhanced 's overall brand image and personality.

Further geographic expansion is planned for 2008 and beyond.

85) Although we have improved our share of the mid-price segment to reach 22%, we are still under-represented in this important part of the market.
86) We have four terrific mid-price brands in our portfolio, , , the brand and , with complementary positionings and different geographic strengths. These brands recorded a combined volume of over 180 billion units in 2007, comparable to Imperial's current total volume excluding Altadis, and are collectively poised for further growth in 2008 and beyond.

89) To turn the tide, we repositioned as the progressive international mid-price brand delivering smooth taste. The re-launch began last year in Romania, Russia and Ukraine.
L&M
The initial results are fully in line with our expectations particularly in terms of product smoothness, pack modernity and image perception. In-switching is coming from target competitive brands, with the number of Young Adult Smoker in-switchers doubling, and gender demographics becoming more balanced. Given the magnitude of the
 
change, we believe that a full turn around of will take some two years to complete in this important region.

95) Other Tobacco Products, often tax-driven substitutes for low-price cigarettes, have received greater focus from PMI over the last three years. Our growth momentum is best illustrated by our success in Germany where we have developed a wide range of product innovations. These include the "tobacco block", which I would describe as the perfect make your own cigarette device. In 2007, we
 
achieved an OTP volume in Germany equivalent to over 5 billion units and our category share surpassed 10% for the first time.
96) More broadly, across the EU, innovations, brand and geographic expansion have driven our estimated category share up from 2 share points in 2004 to 8 share points in 2007, a promising start that highlights our ability to perform strongly beyond our core cigarette expertise.
97) In 2007, PMI accounted for an estimated 15.6% of the international market, and 25.2% excluding China. We are convinced that our strong brand portfolio, coupled with our new consumer based innovation pipeline, our re-energized organization and the benefits derived from our scale and superior infrastructure will enable us to gain market share from our main international competitors. Also, outside China, there is still a 29% share of the international market that is predominantly controlled by smaller scale, local companies.
In the international market, there are still more than five out of every six adult smokers who are consuming brands that are not manufactured and sold by PMI. This represents a formidable potential for growth going forward.
98) In particular, PMI today has small or no presence in four major markets, China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam, which have a combined cigarette volume of 2.3 trillion units. These markets, which account for some 40% of total international cigarette consumption, represent clear opportunities for further growth in the mid to long-term.
99) Let me now give you a brief update on China and our strategic partnership with the China National Tobacco Company. We are pleased with the progress to date and the relationship of mutual trust that has been established at the most senior level as well as between our respective affiliates. Our joint venture is now operational and we have started the commercialization of Chinese brands in Europe. They will be gradually deployed in several markets around the world. We also finalized the plans for the launch of licensed on the Chinese market. This is expected to take place this
Marlboro
 
summer. While we do not foresee a material impact on our volume and profitability in the near future, we believe this long-term strategic cooperation will prove to be mutually beneficial and form the foundation for strong long-term growth.
100) To supplement our organic growth we will continue to seek out attractive acquisition opportunities. PMI has an excellent track record in acquiring and integrating companies. Our businesses in Central Europe, Latin America and in Indonesia are excellent illustrations. While I will not provide specific examples, rest assured that we will continue to assess potential opportunities across the globe in both the cigarette and other tobacco categories that meet our stringent financial and strategic criteria.
101) Another central element of our strategy is to successfully deal with the challenges and opportunities posed by evolving regulatory and fiscal environments.
102) For the near term, we expect that the regulatory focus will continue to be on the traditional areas of marketing, health warnings, including graphic ones, public smoking bans and descriptors. In the longer term, we expect the focus will gradually shift towards the product, including ingredients, smoking constituent levels and related performance standards. These matters constitute largely un-chartered territory for regulators, and we see a good opportunity for PMI to provide expertise and comprehensive solutions as a result of our transparent and supportive approach to reasonable regulation.
103) Regulation is of course not new to PMI. Many of our markets such as Australia, France, Italy, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, to name a few, have been heavily regulated for many years and we have competed very successfully in such markets, significantly increasing our market share and profitability.
In fact we believe that, given our public affairs expertise, unparalleled R&D capabilities, state of the art manufacturing facilities and ability to anticipate regulatory trends and integrate them into our long term business plans, we are in a strong position to compete successfully.
 
104) We see regulation as a means to create a level playing field, requiring all manufacturers and all products to comply with the same high standards and we believe regulation can help address the problem of both illicit trade and youth smoking.
This does not mean that we will accept each and every regulatory proposal. We will vigorously defend our right to commercialize products that adult consumers enjoy and our ability to communicate directly with these consumers. And we will oppose product regulation, where sound scientific evidence indicates it is very unlikely to foster harm reduction.
105) We believe that an effective tobacco control policy must incorporate harm reduction through the product.
106) We are therefore vigorously pursuing the development of products that we hope will substantially reduce the risk of diseases, as well as the creation of risk measurement methods to reduce the product assessment cycles, which today are limited to long term epidemiological studies. We believe both are achievable. We are also seeking regulatory frameworks to support the development, evaluation, commercialization and risk categorization of such products.
107) We are encouraged that leading countries in the field of tobacco regulation are beginning to recognize the need for such an approach. We hope that, in the near future, adult smokers who do not choose to quit tobacco usage will have the opportunity and the right to choose from a selection of products that, following appropriate government review, have been deemed to present less risk of disease than conventional products.
108) Regarding the fiscal outlook, as Louis mentioned, we do see an improved, fairer and more predictable excise tax environment going forward.
109) There is a clear trend in most countries towards excise tax structures that do not discriminate or discriminate less against premium products and are more consistent with public health views that all tobacco products should be taxed at the same level. 22 of our
 
top 25 OCI markets have in place effective Minimum Excise Taxes, a Minimum Retail Price mechanism or very high specific tax structures, which are much more conducive to fiscal predictability.
110) Indonesia, for example, introduced a specific element in its excise tax system for the first time in 2007 and earlier this year increased this amount while reducing the ad-valorem component as part of a planned excise tax restructuring program.
111) Russia also made important changes to its excise tax system in three key respects. First, through the introduction of the Minimum Excise Tax concept in 2005 as a percentage of the net ex factory price. Second, through the introduction of a specific MET in January 2007. And, third, through the government's commitment for a predominantly specific excise tax regime for the next three years.
112) PMI has developed a world class R&D organization and is completing a dedicated new research center in Neuchatel, Switzerland. PMI will have the rights outside the USA to all developments that have taken place under the former PM USA and PMI R&D umbrella.
113) One of the key tasks of our R&D and product development team is the development of an expanded pipeline of innovative products. We have excellent capabilities in the key areas of blending, packaging and cigarette and filter construction for conventional products.
114) The second key task is quality assurance and regulatory compliance, both of which play an increasingly important role in our more highly regulated environment. We believe that we have developed a competitive edge in this field.
115) R&D is of course not only about supporting today's business. We have hired top scientists to undertake research that we hope will enable us to better understand the mechanism of smoking related diseases as part of our efforts to develop potentially reduced risk products.
116) As you know we have in test market the electronically heated cigarette, "Heatbar", and we expect to have more types of products ready for testing over the next three years.
 
117) Going forward, we foresee annual spending on R&D to be approximately $300 million, split roughly evenly between conventional products and next generation products.
118) I'll now turn the floor over to Hermann who will present our cost reduction and productivity initiatives and the financial strategy we will pursue to enhance shareholder returns.
[Remarks by Dr. Waldemer]
Thank you, Andr.
119) Let me start first with a review of the evolution of our reported operating income per thousand cigarettes. This has grown since 2003 from $8.42 to $10.44, representing a compound annual growth rate of 5.5%. 's marginal contribution increased at an even more impressive rate of 9.5%.
Marlboro
120) Moreover, during this period, in spite of our strong growth in lower margin emerging markets, our operating margin has increased slightly, reaching 40% on an adjusted basis in 2007.
How do we stand today in comparison with our peers? Our adjusted operating margin is some 10 percentage points higher than that of BAT and Japan Tobacco. Once Imperial has integrated Altadis into its numbers, we will be best in class and going forward our goal is to widen the gap further versus our peers.
121) On the cost side, let's compare hard numbers that are not influenced by allocations or accounting treatments and therefore look at total operating cost straight from the respective reported income statements of the four major international cigarette companies.
Despite our focus on higher cost premium brands, we are already today almost at par with Imperial in terms of average operating costs per thousand cigarettes. Japan Tobacco's costs are 12% higher and BAT's costs are 21% higher than our $16.40.
122) My next point of comparison is efficiency in manufacturing.
 
PMI has the best manufacturing footprint in the industry with an average volume of 18 billion units per factory today. This compares to 13 billion per factory for BAT and Imperial.
123) We have achieved this through our sourcing strategy and restructuring actions that have included investments to expand and improve key factories, particularly in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey, the consolidation of production in the Czech Republic, the closure of our factory in Hungary and the closure of our leaf processing facility in Virginia. We are currently in the process of closing our Munich factory.
124) Our top ten factories produce 60% of our worldwide volume and our top five factories have a capacity equal to the entire volume of Imperial and Altadis combined. Our state of the art Western European factories in Bergen-op-Zoom (Netherlands) and in Berlin focus on long production runs.
125) Our four low-cost Central European EU factories absorb the more complex and shorter production runs. The average output in these four factories will increase to 31 billion cigarettes by 2010 compared to 12.5 billion back in 2004.
126) We have generated significant productivity gains in manufacturing and are relentlessly continuing these efforts. In spite of the resourcing of 57 billion units from PM USA to PMI, which by itself will generate $179 million of annual cost savings by 2009, we expect to have reduced our fixed manufacturing headcount by 30% over the 2004 to 2010 period.
127) This will drive a forecast 14% reduction in our fixed costs per thousand over the same time period.
Major efficiency improvements are being generated by the implementation of what we call the "Clustering Model", whereby we group specific activities, such as operations planning, procurement and supply chain and product development, in selected factories. This model enables us to provide better brand support and increase speed to market, to foster synergies and best practices, to eliminate duplication and therefore reduce manufacturing costs.
 
128) Going forward, we see significant productivity savings from a new focus on eliminating non strategic SKU's that do not provide adequate returns. Our aim is not only to reduce the number of variants, but also to streamline product specifications, blends and non-tobacco materials. In addition to generating cost savings, we will thus reduce working capital requirements as well as capital expenditures on equipment.
129) Overall, the net cumulative effect of these manufacturing initiatives and savings by 2010 is expected to be approximately $850 million.
We, however, anticipate some offsetting cost increases. We project leaf costs to cumulatively increase by $425 million and direct materials increases of $125 million, totaling $550 million over the same period.
130) One issue is the indirect local currency impact on the Dollar denominated price of tobacco leaf. For example, the strengthening of the Brazilian Real had a negative impact of $56 million on our 2007 cost basis, which was not captured in our currency variance.
131) Let me now turn to our third area of focus: G&A and procurement, where we are increasing organizational effectiveness and will deliver further cost savings in three main areas.
First, we have eliminated some 400 positions in Switzerland and our regional headquarters in Hong Kong and New York and have transferred 100 positions back out to the markets for a net saving of 300 positions, in line with our decision to empower the markets with greater resources and more decision authority.
132) Second, we have developed and deployed Shared Service Centers for our Finance, Human Resources and Procurement functions.
133) Third, we have deployed a standardized and worldwide integrated SAP network, combined with established centers of expertise.
134) Fourth, we will further optimize our selling and promotional expenses.
 
135) These four initiatives are expected to generate cumulative savings of over $450 million over the next three years.
136) Finally, let me share with you our three-year cost strategy for the EU Region. This strategy includes specific spending and cost saving targets for the region and each individual market to substantially reduce our back office infrastructure.
This strategy is expected to generate $250 million of cumulative cost savings over the next three years.
137) These combined initiatives are expected to generate gross savings of more than $1.5 billion and net savings of one billion Dollars, which will allow us to judiciously re-invest into the growth of our business, cover other cost increases and deliver robust earnings growth.
138) Let me now focus on capital structure, cash flow and shareholder return.
139) We will pursue prudent financial policies to secure solid investment grade ratings. We have obtained PMI's credit ratings from the agencies. I am pleased to inform you that they are A2 / A / A+.
140) PMI has secured committed revolving and term credit facilities of $9.1 billion in total. Shortly after the spin-off is effective, we will start our US and European commercial paper programs. We also intend to term out a significant portion of our debt by accessing the global capital markets in 2008 and 2009.
141) PMI is generating outstanding cash flows. Our operating pro-forma cash flow was $5.4 billion in 2007 and it is expected to reach a cumulative total of about $22 billion over the next three years, representing an average annual increase of 10 to 12% a year, driven by higher net earnings and tight management of our working capital requirements. In addition, we expect capital expenditures going forward to match our depreciation and amortization.
 
142) This strong cash flow, supplemented by borrowings, will be used to fund dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other investments in the business.
Our dividend policy anticipates a pay-out ratio of 65%. The initial quarterly dividend rate has been set at $0.46 per share.
The Board of Directors authorized in January a share repurchase program of $13 billion over two years.
As a result, in total, we expect to return approximately $21 billion to our shareholders over the next 2 years.
143) This brings me to one of the key charts that deserves repetition: our financial and volume growth expectations.
As announced in January, we project 2008 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 12% to 14% at the then prevailing exchange rates from a 2007 pro-forma adjusted base of $2.78. It is still early in the year, but if exchange rates stay were they are now, our EPS growth rate could well exceed our guidance by up to two percentage points. However, it would be imprudent to call this now and we will revise our guidance if necessary as the year unfolds.
144) Based on our strengths, our strategies and our assessment of the improving business environment going forward, we expect to achieve the following longer term growth rates:
 
 
 
145) We strongly believe that these are realistic and achievable targets. I would nevertheless like to outline some of the potential upsides and downsides that go along with this outlook.
Exchange rates can have a substantial impact and, of course are hard to predict. For example, every one Euro cent movement up or down has an impact of approximately $20 million on our OCI at today's rates.
146) Potential threats or downside risks include:
 
 
 
 
147) We believe that these risks are balanced by a number of potential opportunities or upsides:
 
 
 
148) Let me conclude by reiterating the key reasons why we believe that Philip Morris International represents a compelling investment:
We are the global leader and have the greatest scale. We lead by every measure, be it volume, revenue, profitability or market presence.
149) We have achieved an excellent geographic balance between mature and emerging markets, with clear opportunities for further profit expansion in the former and profit and volume expansion in the latter.
150) We have a world class brand portfolio, led by the only truly global brand, , and containing a total of seven of the top 15 international brands.
Marlboro
151) With 15.6% of the world market, PMI has significant opportunities for further volume expansion, which will be driven by innovation, consumer uptrading to our leading premium brands in emerging markets and geographic expansion.
 
152) I have described for you our productivity initiatives that we expect to drive net cost reductions of $1 billion by 2010.
153) Our tremendous cash flow is forecast to reach around $22 billion over the next three years.
154) We plan to return some $21 billion in cash to our shareholders over the next two years.
155) And we expect to achieve 10% to 12% longer term growth in Earnings per Share, which we believe will measure up well not only against our tobacco peers but against other leading global consumer packaged goods companies.
156) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your interest in our company. Louis, Andr and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
