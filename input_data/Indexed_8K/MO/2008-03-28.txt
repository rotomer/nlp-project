The Parties have made a good faith effort as of the date hereof to identify each Transition Service and to complete the content of the Exhibits accurately. It is anticipated that the Parties will modify the Transition Services from time to time. In that case or to the extent that any Exhibit is incomplete, the Parties will use good faith efforts to modify the Exhibits.

In those cases, the specific terms described in the Exhibits shall govern that Transition Service.
(b) The Parties may also identify additional Services that they wish to incorporate into this Agreement. The Parties will create additional Exhibits setting forth the description of such Services, the Fees for such Services and any other applicable terms.
 
ALCS will provide the Transition Services either through its own resources, through the resources of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, or by contracting with independent contractors as agreed hereunder. To the extent that ALCS decides to provide a Transition Service through an independent contractor in the future, ALCS shall consult with and obtain the prior approval of PMI, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
In providing the Transition Services hereunder, ALCS will exercise the same degree of care as it has historically exercised in providing such Transition Services to its Affiliates prior to the date hereof, including at least the same level of quality, responsiveness and timeliness as has been exercised by ALCS with respect to such Transition Services.

The Parties will cooperate with each other in making such information available as needed in the event of any and all internal or external audits, whether in the United States or any other country. If this Agreement is terminated in whole or in part, the Parties will cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in order to effect an efficient transition and to minimize the disruption to the business of both Parties, including the assignment or transfer of the rights and obligations under any contracts.
 
Each Party shall take such actions, upon request of the other Party and in addition to the actions specified in this Agreement, as may be necessary or reasonably appropriate to implement or give effect to this Agreement.
ALCS is hereby authorized to act as agent for PMI for the purpose of performing Services hereunder and as is necessary or desirable to perform such Services.

In the event that a Party is entitled to receive indemnification under this Article IV with respect to any Tax for which there has been a Final Determination, such Party ("Indemnified Party") shall send to the other Party ("Indemnifying Party") an invoice requesting payment accompanied by a statement describing in reasonable detail the amount owed and the particulars relating thereto.

Altria and PMI Covenants
6.02 . PMI may take actions inconsistent with the representations in Section 5.01 of this Agreement and covenants in this Section 6.02 only if, prior to taking such action, PMI (1) provides notification, upon determining that it shall pursue such action, to Altria of its plans with respect to such action, and promptly responds to any inquiries made by Altria following such notification, and (2) obtains Altria's written consent to such action (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Altria consent shall not relieve PMI of any of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any PMI indemnity obligation arising under Section 4.02(b) of this Agreement. PMI covenants to Altria that:
Specific PMI Covenants
(a) During the two-year period following the Distribution Date, PMI will not liquidate or merge or consolidate with any other person in one or more transactions pursuant to which the shareholders of the other person(s) in such transaction(s) hold directly or indirectly a forty percent or greater interest (by vote or value) in the combined company.
(b) During the two-year period following the Distribution Date, PMI and each of its Subsidiaries will not transfer all or substantially all of its assets in a transaction, including all or substantially all of the assets of PMI's active trade or business used to satisfy Section 355(b) of the Code.
(c) During the two-year period following the Distribution Date, PMI will continue the active conduct of its trade or business used to satisfy Section 355(b) of the Code.
(d) PMI will not redeem or repurchase PMI stock in a manner contrary to the requirements of Revenue Procedure 96-30 or in any other manner contrary to the representations made in the Ruling and Tax Opinion Documents.
(e) During the two-year period following the Distribution Date, PMI will not issue, in one or more transactions, PMI stock (or any instrument that is convertible or exchangeable into such PMI stock) that in the aggregate represents more than a forty percent interest (by vote or value) of PMI.
 
(f) During the two-year period following the Distribution Date, PMI will not enter into any negotiations, agreements, understandings, or arrangements with respect to transactions or events (including, without limitation, stock issuances, pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise, option grants, capital contributions or acquisitions or a series of such transactions or events, but excluding the Distribution) that may alone or in the aggregate cause the Distribution to be treated as part of a plan (i) pursuant to which one or more persons would acquire directly or indirectly stock of PMI representing a forty percent or greater interest (by vote or value); or (ii) which would result in a transaction described in Section 6.02(a) above.
(g) PMI will not otherwise take any action or fail to take any other action, which action or failure to act may result in Distribution Taxes.
(h) For purposes of paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Section 6.02, whether a forty percent or greater ownership change is or would be involved in one or more transactions shall be determined under multiple methods that reflect the differing number of PMI shares outstanding at various times (e.g., on the Distribution Date, immediately prior to each transaction, etc.) and the method chosen shall be the one that results in the largest potential ownership change. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Section 6.02, whether a forty percent or greater ownership change is or would be involved in one or more transactions shall be measured by aggregating the ownership change attributable to all transactions of the types described in (a), (e) and (f).
7.01 . Altria shall have the right to (i) contest, compromise, or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed, asserted or assessed as a result of any audit of any consolidated or combined return filed by the Altria Consolidated Return Group; (ii) file, prosecute, compromise or settle any claim for refund; and (iii) determine whether any refunds to which the Altria Consolidated Return Group may be entitled shall be received by way of refund or credited against the tax liability of the Altria Consolidated Return Group; provided, however, that Altria shall be obligated to act in good faith with respect to any Tax Contest of any consolidated or combined return filed by the Altria Consolidated Return Group which involves a Tax or adjustment for which PMI is liable pursuant to this Agreement ("PMI Tax Contest"). Specifically, Altria shall, in good faith, (i) consult with PMI regarding its comments with respect to any such PMI Tax Contest, including any correspondence or filings submitted
Representation with Respect to Tax Contests
 
in connection therewith; (ii) consult with PMI as to strategy and settlement decisions with respect to any PMI Tax Contest, including any correspondence or filings submitted in connection therewith; and (iii) use its best efforts to arrive at a settlement of any such PMI Tax Contest that reflects the ultimate merits of the issues without taking into account the fact that PMI is liable for the Tax or adjustment under this Agreement.
(a) With respect to any PMI Tax Contest, Altria shall (i) keep PMI informed in a timely manner of all actions taken or proposed to be taken by Altria and (ii) timely provide PMI with copies of any correspondence or filings submitted to any Taxing Authority in connection with any contest, litigation, compromise or settlement relating to any such adjustment in any such Tax Contest. In addition, with respect to any Tax Contest in which a Taxing Authority has asserted a position that may result in a PMI indemnification obligation arising under Section 4.02(b) of this Agreement, PMI shall have the right, at its own expense, to attend and participate in any such Tax Contest.
(b) The failure of Altria timely to forward notification in accordance with Section 7.01(a) shall not relieve PMI of any obligation to pay such Tax or adjustment or indemnify Altria, except to the extent PMI was actually materially prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall such failure relieve PMI from any other liability or obligation which it may have to Altria.
8.01 . All payments required by this Agreement shall be made by (1) wire transfer to the appropriate bank account as may from time to time be designated by the Parties for such purpose, or (2) any other method agreed to by the Parties. All payments due under this Agreement shall be deemed to be paid when available funds are actually received by the payee.
Method of Payment
8.02 . Any payment required by this Agreement that is not made on or before the date required hereunder shall bear interest, from and after such date through the date of payment, calculated at the rate determined under Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code as modified by Section 6621(c) of the Code or as otherwise determined by any relevant Taxing Authority.
Interest
8.03 . For all Tax purposes, the Parties hereto agree to treat, and to cause their respective affiliates to treat, (1) any payment required by this Agreement (to the extent not otherwise treated as a payment in respect of an existing intercompany account) either as a contribution by Altria to PMI or a distribution by PMI to Altria, as the case may be, occurring immediately prior to the Distribution and (2) any payment of interest or non-Federal Income Taxes by or to a Tax Authority, as taxable or deductible, as the case may be, to the Parties entitled under this Agreement to retain such
Characterization of Payments
 
payment or required under this Agreement to make such payment, in either case, except as otherwise mandated by applicable law or a Final Determination; provided that in the event it is determined (i) pursuant to applicable law that it is more likely than not, or (ii) pursuant to a Final Determination, that any such treatment is not permissible (or that an Indemnified Party nevertheless suffers an income Tax or other Tax detriment as a result of such payment), the payment in question shall be adjusted to place the Indemnified Party in the same after-tax position it would have enjoyed absent such applicable law or Final Determination.
9.01 . Altria may, at its option, elect, and the PMI Group shall join it in electing (if necessary), to ratably allocate items (other than extraordinary items) of the PMI Group in accordance with relevant provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76. If Altria makes such an election, the members of the PMI Group shall provide to Altria such statements as are required under the regulations and other appropriate assistance.
Allocation
9.02 . Within thirty days after the Distribution Date, Altria shall pay to PMI an amount equal to the Federal Income Tax reserve for uncertain Tax positions attributable to the PMI Group and recorded on the books and records of Altria as of the Distribution Date.
Payment of Reserves

(b) If a Party fails to comply with any of its obligations set forth in Section 9.03(a) of this Agreement upon reasonable request and notice by the other Party, and such failure results in the imposition of additional Taxes, the nonperforming Party shall be liable in full for such additional Taxes.

Cooperation
Article VI
Section 8.01
 
7.01 . The Parties have reviewed the long historical experience with the Cost Sharing Agreements, including:
Presumption
(a) the time typically required to analyze research and development results and conceive of an invention;
(b) the time that typically elapses between the conception of an invention, its actual reduction to practice and the filing of a patent application for that invention or the inclusion of that invention in a new product; and
(c) the expenditure by the Parties or their Affiliates of considerable resources and millions of dollars in the course of their long-standing and close research and development cooperation and collaboration.
Based on that review, in the judgment of those persons at both Parties (and their Affiliates) who have worked most closely on the creation of the Jointly Funded IP, the Parties have concluded that it is highly probable that any Independent Invention in a Field of Use:
(i) for which a Party or an Affiliate of that Party files a patent application during the Transition Period; or
(ii) that the Party or an Affiliate of that Party incorporates into a new product during the Transition Period
will be Non-Severable and will substantially arise from the Jointly Funded IP.
7.02 .
Patented Independent Inventions  Transition Period
(a) If, during the Transition Period, either Party or an Affiliate of a Party (collectively, the "filing Party") files, or a Third Party files on behalf of a filing Party, a patent application on an Independent Invention that is within a Field of Use, then the filing Party shall notify the other Party in writing no later than the Notice Date. With respect to all Intellectual Property that is included in such Independent Invention and is described or claimed in such patent application:
(i) PM USA shall own all such Intellectual Property rights in the U.S.; and
(ii) PMI or an Affiliate of PMI shall own all such Intellectual Property rights outside the U.S.,
unless the filing Party is able to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the other Party that the Independent Invention is Severable or does not substantially arise from the Jointly Funded IP. If the Parties are unable to agree, they shall submit the matter for resolution under hereof.
Article IX
 
(b) If the Parties agree, or the mediator or the arbitrator pursuant to or hereof determines, that the Independent Invention for which a patent application is filed during the Transition Period either:
Section 9.03
9.04
(i) is not within a Field of Use; or
(ii) does not substantially arise from the Jointly Funded IP;
then this Agreement shall not apply to such Independent Invention.
(c) If the Parties agree, or the mediator or the arbitrator pursuant to or hereof determines, that the Independent Invention for which a patent application is filed during the Transition Period:
Section 9.03
9.04
(i) is within a Field of Use; and
(ii) substantially arises from the Jointly Funded IP; but
(iii) is Severable;
then the terms of subparagraph (b) of hereof shall apply.
Section 7.03
7.03 .
Patented Independent Inventions  Option Period
(a) If, during the Option Period but after the expiration of the Transition Period, a filing Party, or a Third Party on behalf of a filing Party, files a patent application on an Independent Invention that:
(i) is within a Field of Use; and

then the filing Party shall notify the other Party in writing no later than the Notice Date of the filing of such patent application and the terms of subparagraph (b) of this shall apply.
Section 7.03
(b) After final agreement or determination pursuant to subparagraph (c) of hereof or receipt of notice pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this , the receiving Party shall have 30 days to notify the filing Party in writing as to whether the receiving Party elects to enter into negotiations pursuant to which the receiving Party or its Affiliates (collectively, the "receiving Party") will obtain ownership or license rights in the receiving Party's Territory with respect to such Independent Invention. Such written notice shall include a summary of the terms upon which the receiving Party proposes to acquire such ownership or license rights for the Independent Invention, including acquisition or license fees or royalties, length and country or countries of ownership or license, exclusivity and covenants of use.
Section 7.02
Section 7.03
 
(c) If the receiving Party elects to make an offer and enter into negotiations pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this , then the Parties or their respective Affiliates shall engage in good faith negotiations on an arm's length basis with respect to the terms of an agreement regarding the Independent Invention. The Persons engaged in the negotiations may structure any such agreement in any manner that they shall determine. If any legal deadlines occur with respect to filing of corresponding patent applications on the Independent Invention in the receiving Party's Territory during such negotiations, then, if the receiving Party so requests, the filing Party shall file such corresponding patent applications at the sole expense of the receiving Party, subject to the option rights set forth in subsection (d) of this .
Section 7.03
Section 7.03
(d) If:
(i) the receiving Party elects not to make an offer;
(ii) the receiving Party breaks off negotiations by written notice; or
(iii) no agreement is reached by the Parties within three months from the Notice Date (unless extended by mutual agreement of the Parties);
then the filing Party shall retain sole and exclusive ownership of Intellectual Property rights in the Independent Invention world-wide or may solicit offers from one or more Third Parties regarding ownership or license of the Independent Invention (each, a "Third-Party Offer"). Before accepting the Third-Party Offer, the filing Party shall deliver to the receiving Party in writing a summary of those terms of the Third-Party Offer that, the filing Party, considering all aspects of the offers taken as a whole, and acting reasonably and in good faith, believes improve upon the offer of the receiving Party; if such summary contains competitively sensitive information (, marketing information), the filing Party will deliver such information to an arbitrator chosen in accordance with hereof in anticipation of seeking assistance in resolving the matter. The receiving Party shall have 30 days to offer in writing to match or improve upon the disclosed terms of the Third-Party Offer. If the filing Party, acting reasonably and in good faith, concludes that the receiving Party's offer matches or improves upon the Third-Party Offer, the filing Party shall accept the receiving Party's offer. If the filing Party, acting reasonably and in good faith, concludes that the receiving Party's offer does not match or improve upon the Third-Party Offer, the filing Party shall so inform the receiving Party in writing within 10 days of receipt of the filing Party's offer. If the receiving Party believes that the filing Party has not acted reasonably and in good faith, the receiving Party shall so inform the filing Party in writing within 10 days of receipt of the filing Party's written notice and the Parties shall submit the matter promptly for resolution with the assistance of an arbitrator chosen in accordance with hereof, which assistance shall be restricted to a determination whether the filing Party has acted reasonably and in good faith in concluding that the receiving Party's offer does not match or improve upon the Third-Party Offer. If the receiving Party agrees with the filing Party's conclusion that the receiving Party's offer does not match or improve upon the Third-Party Offer or if the matter is resolved in accordance with hereof in favor of the filing Party's conclusion, the filing Party shall be free to accept the Third-Party Offer.
