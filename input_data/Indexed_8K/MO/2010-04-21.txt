Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va. April 21, 2010  Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced that its 2010 first-quarter reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 39.3% to $0.39 versus $0.28 in the prior-year period. Reported first-quarter results were higher than results for the prior-year period, due primarily to higher 2010 operating companies income (OCI) from cigarettes, smokeless products and wine, and higher 2010 earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller plc (SABMiller), due primarily to gains resulting from issuances of common stock by SABMiller, as well as 2009 first-quarter transaction costs and financing fees related to the acquisition of UST. These factors were partially offset by lower OCI from financial services and cigars. Altria's 2010 first-quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 7.7% to $0.42 versus $0.39 in the prior-year period as shown in Table 1 below.
"Altria delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7% in a challenging environment, behind strong income growth in our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses,"
 
said Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria. "We continue to be pleased with the performance of our tobacco companies' brands, particularly and . achieved record retail share results in the first quarter, and regained its position as the largest smokeless tobacco brand, as measured by retail share."

"In addition to this strong income performance, Altria increased its dividend by 2.9% to an annualized rate of $1.40 per share, reflecting our new dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share, which demonstrates our commitment to return a large amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends," said Mr. Szymanczyk.
 
 
Dividend Increase
In February 2010, Altria announced that its Board of Directors had voted to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 2.9% to $0.35 per common share versus the previous rate of $0.34 per common share. This dividend increase was consistent with the previously announced change in the dividend payout ratio target from approximately 75% to approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted earnings per share. The new annualized dividend rate is $1.40 per common share. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board of Directors.
Cost Management
Altria and its companies achieved $43 million in cost savings in the first quarter of 2010. Altria expects to achieve approximately $419 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011 for total anticipated cost reductions of $1.5 billion versus 2006, as shown in Table 2 below.
 
Philip Morris USA's (PM USA) Manufacturing Optimization Program delivered $37 million in cost savings in the first quarter of 2010. PM USA expects to achieve approximately $151 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011 in connection with this program, for total anticipated cost reductions of $188 million. Altria incurred pre-tax charges of $29 million in the first quarter of 2010 for exit and implementation costs primarily related to this initiative. Altria expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $70 million later this year primarily related to this initiative.
 
Note: Altria expects to generate an estimated $300 million in UST integration cost savings by the end of 2011. UST integration costs savings are included primarily in the general corporate expense and SG&A line item beginning in 2009.
UST Restructuring and Integration Charges
In January 2009, Altria completed the acquisition of UST LLC (UST) and its subsidiaries, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (USSTC) and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (Ste. Michelle). Altria incurred pre-tax charges of $15 million in the first quarter of 2010 for acquisition-related charges as well as restructuring and integration costs. Altria expects to incur charges of approximately $35 million later this year related to this initiative. Altria expects the UST acquisition to be accretive to its adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2010.
2010 Full-Year Guidance
The business environment for 2010 is likely to remain challenging, as adult consumers remain under economic pressure and face high unemployment. Altria reaffirms that its 2010 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.82. This forecast includes estimated charges of $0.07 per share related to exit, integration and implementation costs, UST acquisition-related costs and SABMiller special items. Altria
 
reaffirms that its 2010 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.89, representing a forecasted growth rate of 6% to 8% from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009. Due to different trade inventory dynamics for tobacco products in 2009 versus 2010, Altria expects the second quarter of 2010 to be more challenging for income growth comparison purposes versus the same year-ago period. Altria anticipates that adjusted diluted earnings per share growth will build in the second half of 2010.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. A reconciliation of Altria's full-year forecasted reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share is shown in Table 3 below.
 
 
Conference Call
A conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on April 21, 2010 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.Access to the webcast is available at www.altria.com.
Altria's management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Altria's management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations because such items can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures to help investors analyze
 
underlying business performance and trends. Such adjusted measures are regularly provided to management for use in the evaluation of segment performance and allocation of resources. For a reconciliation of OCI to operating income, see the Consolidated Statements of Earnings contained in this release. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are also provided in the release.
Altria's reporting segments are Cigarettes, manufactured by PM USA; Smokeless Products, manufactured by USSTC and PM USA; Cigars, manufactured by John Middleton Co. (Middleton); Wine, produced and distributed by Ste. Michelle; and Financial Services, provided by Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC).
Altria's net revenues increased 27.3% to $5.8 billion, due primarily to higher pricing related to last year's federal excise tax (FET) increase on tobacco products. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 3.6% to $4.0 billion. Operating income increased 20.1% versus the prior-year period to $1.4 billion, due primarily to higher OCI from cigarettes and smokeless products, and the 2009 UST acquisition-related transaction costs, partially offset by lower OCI from financial services. Altria's net earnings increased 38.0% versus the prior-year period to $813 million, due primarily to higher operating income and higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller in the first quarter of 2010, and lower interest and other debt expense, net as a result of 2009 first-quarter financing fees related to the acquisition of UST.
The cigarettes segment's financial and volume comparisons for the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period were impacted by events related to last year's FET increase on tobacco products.
Net revenues for the cigarettes segment increased 31.5% versus the prior-year period to $5.1 billion, due primarily to higher pricing related to the FET increase. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 5.5% versus the prior-year period, due primarily to higher list prices. Reported OCI for the cigarettes segment increased 7.6% versus the prior-year period to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices, and lower implementation and exit costs, partially offset by FDA user fees and lower volume. Excluding implementation and exit costs related to the previously announced closure of PM USA's Cabarrus manufacturing facility, adjusted OCI increased 6.7% versus the prior-year period to $1.3 billion. Revenues and OCI for the cigarettes segment are summarized in Table 4 below.
 
PM USA has revised its cigarettes segment reporting of volume and retail share results to reflect how management evaluates segment performance. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, PM USA is reporting the volume and retail share performance as follows: ; Other Premium brands, such as , and ; and Discount brands, which includes and as well as other discount brands.

PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume for the first quarter of 2010 was 0.7% lower than the prior-year period, due primarily to different inventory dynamics in the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period. In March 2009, PM USA's shipment volume was negatively impacted as wholesalers and retailers depleted their inventories of PM USA's brands in anticipation of the FET increase, which occurred on April 1, 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, the trade rebuilt their inventories of PM USA's brands. In the first quarter of 2010, the trade increased inventory levels on PM USA's brands from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
After adjusting for changes in trade inventories, PM USA's 2010 first-quarter domestic shipment cigarette volume was estimated to be down approximately 11% versus the prior-year period. Total cigarette category volume was down an estimated 10% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period when adjusted for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's cigarette volume performance is summarized in Table 5 below.
 
Note: Volume includes units sold as well as promotional units, but excludes Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, Overseas Military, and Philip Morris Duty Free Inc.; percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest million.
achieved record retail share results in the first quarter of 2010. 's first-quarter retail share increased 0.3 share points versus the prior-year period to 42.7%, driven primarily by Menthol and the introduction of Special Blend products. PM USA's retail share performance is summarized in Table 6 below.

Altria acquired UST and its smokeless tobacco business, USSTC, on January 6, 2009. As a result, USSTC's financial results from January 6 through March 31, 2009 are included in Altria's consolidated and segment results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. In addition, the smokeless products segment includes PM USA's smokeless products.
The smokeless products segment's financial and volume comparisons for the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period were impacted by events related to last year's FET increase on tobacco products.
 
Net revenues for the smokeless products segment increased 27.9% versus the prior-year period to $381 million, due primarily to higher volume. Reported OCI for the smokeless products segment was $178 million, an increase of $180 million versus the prior-year period, due primarily to lower exit, integration and UST acquisition-related costs, higher volume and cost savings. Excluding exit, integration and UST acquisition-related costs, adjusted OCI increased 49.2% versus the prior-year period to $188 million. Revenues and OCI for the smokeless products segment are summarized in Table 7 below.
 
USSTC and PM USA's combined reported domestic smokeless products shipment volume was 21.9% higher versus the prior-year period, due primarily to product initiatives in the first quarter of 2010 and trade inventory changes in the prior-year period. Shipments of Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural, as well as the national expansion of Snus, all occurred at the end of the first quarter of 2010. also expanded the distribution of its Slim Can pouch initiative in the first quarter of 2010. In addition, in the first quarter of 2009 the trade depleted inventories prior to the FET increase. Reported 2010 first-quarter volume increases were partially offset by the discontinuation of USSTC's multi-can promotional deals and its brand in the first quarter of 2009.

USSTC and PM USA's combined domestic smokeless products shipment volume for the first quarter of 2010 was estimated to be up approximately 5%. and 's combined first-quarter adjusted shipment volume increased an estimated 11% when adjusted for new product pipeline volume and trade inventory changes, as well as other factors. USSTC believes that the smokeless category's volume grew at an estimated rate of approximately 7% in the first quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM USA's combined volume performance for smokeless products is summarized in Table 8 below.

Note: Other includes PM USA smokeless products. Volume includes cans and packs sold, as well as promotional units but excludes international volume. Additionally, 2009 volume includes 10.9 million cans of domestic volume shipped by USSTC prior to the UST acquisition. Percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest thousand. New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing moist smokeless tobacco (MST) products on a can for can basis. USSTC and PM USA have assumed the following equivalent ratios to calculate volumes of cans and packs shipped. One pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is equivalent to one can of MST. One can of

Slim Can pouches is equivalent to a 0.53 can of MST. All other products are considered to be equivalent on a can for can basis. If our assumptions regarding these equivalent ratios change, it may result in a change to these reported results.
USSTC and PM USA's combined retail share of smokeless products decreased 0.8 share points versus the prior-year period; however, the combined retail share increased 0.8 share points versus the fourth-quarter of 2009. and 's combined retail share grew 1.0 share point versus the prior-year period, and 0.8 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2009. 's retail share grew 1.9 share points versus the prior-year period to 25.6%, and 1.0 share point versus the fourth quarter of 2009, as the brand benefited from the launch of Long Cut Wintergreen in the fourth quarter of 2009. 's retail share declined 0.9 share points versus the prior-year period to 23.1%, and 0.2 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2009. USSTC and PM USA's combined retail share performance for smokeless products is summarized in Table 9 below.

Smokeless Products is defined as moist smokeless and spit-less tobacco products. Other includes PM USA smokeless tobacco products. It is SymphonyIRI's standard practice to periodically refresh their InfoScan syndicated services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released. New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configuration of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can for can basis. USSTC and PM USA have assumed that one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is equivalent to one can of MST. All other products are considered to be equivalent on a can for can basis. If our assumptions regarding these equivalent ratios change, it may result in a change to these reported results.
The cigars segment's financial and volume comparisons for the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period were impacted by events related to last year's FET increase on tobacco products.
Net revenues for the cigars segment increased 17.4% versus the prior-year period to $135 million, reflecting higher pricing primarily related to the 2009 FET increase. Revenues net of excise taxes for the cigars segment decreased 12.1% versus the prior-year period to $87 million, due primarily to lower volume. Last year, reported OCI for the cigars segment in the first quarter increased 31.7%, largely due to trade purchases in advance of last year's FET increase. This year, reported OCI for the cigars segment in the first quarter of 2010 decreased 13.0% versus the prior-year period to $47 million, due primarily to lower volume, partially offset by higher pricing. Adjusted OCI for cigars in the first quarter of 2010, which excludes integration costs, decreased 15.8% versus the prior-year period to $48 million. Revenues and OCI for the cigars segment are summarized in Table 10 below.
 
Middleton's reported cigar volume decreased 18.3% versus the prior-year period to 282 million units due to the following factors. Middleton believes that wholesalers accumulated cigar inventory in advance of the FET increase during the first quarter of 2009 because there was no floor tax in the 2009 FET increase for machine-made large cigars. Middleton also shipped new product pipeline volume for Wood Tip in the first quarter of 2009. Finally, wholesalers reduced inventory levels on Middleton's products from the beginning to the end of the first quarter of 2010.
Black & Mild
After adjusting for changes in trade inventories, Middleton's shipment volume was estimated to be essentially flat versus the prior-year period. Middleton believes that the machine-made large cigars category's volume was essentially flat in the first quarter of 2010. Middleton's volume performance for cigars is summarized in Table 11 below.
 
Note: Percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest thousand.
Middleton's retail share increased 0.1 share point versus the prior-year period to 28.6%. In the first quarter of 2010, 's retail share increased 0.3 share points versus the prior-year period to 28.2% as it benefited from the 2009 introductions of Wood Tip and Wood Tip Wine. Middleton's retail share performance for cigars is summarized in Table 12 below.

Note: Retail share results for cigars are based on data from SymphonyIRI Group (SymphonyIRI) InfoScan Cigar Database for Food, Drug, Mass Merchandisers (excluding Wal-Mart) and Convenience trade classes, which tracks machine-made large cigars market share performance. Middleton defines machine-made large cigars as cigars made by machine that weigh greater than three pounds per thousand, except cigars sold at retail in packages of 20 cigars. This service was developed to provide a representation of retail business performance in key trade channels. It is SymphonyIRI's standard practice to periodically refresh their InfoScan syndicated services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released.
Altria acquired UST and its premium wine business, Ste. Michelle, on January 6, 2009. As a result, Ste. Michelle's financial results from January 6 through March 31, 2009 are included in Altria's consolidated and segment results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Net revenues for the wine segment increased 26.7% versus the prior-year period to $95 million and revenues net of excise taxes increased 26.4% to $91 million, due primarily to higher volume. Reported OCI for the wine segment increased $6 million versus the prior-year period to $7 million, due primarily to higher volume and lower pre-tax charges for exit, integration and acquisition-related costs. Excluding those pre-tax charges, adjusted OCI for the wine segment increased 33.3% versus the prior-year period to $12 million as shown in Table 13 below.
 
 
Ste. Michelle's first quarter of 2010 wine shipment volume increased 22% versus the prior-year period to 1.4 million cases, due primarily to the strength of its wines, higher trade inventory levels as wholesalers rebuilt inventory levels from last year, higher on-premise channel volume that includes restaurants and bars, and calendar differences.
Chateau Ste. Michelle
After adjusting for calendar differences, Ste. Michelle's wine shipment volume was estimated to be up 16% versus the prior-year period. Ste. Michelle's volume performance for wine is summarized in Table 14 below.
 
Note: Percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest hundred.
Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume, as measured by Nielsen Total Wine Database  U.S. Food, Drug & Liquor (Nielsen), increased 6.1% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period. The total wine industry's retail unit volume, as measured by Nielsen, increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the prior-year period.
Reported OCI for the financial services segment was $21 million, a decrease of $99 million versus the prior-year period, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales in 2010. The allowance for losses at the end of the first quarter of 2010 was $202 million, which reflects a decrease of $64 million during the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to write-offs related to leases with General Motors LLC, the successor to General Motors Corporation's North American automobile business. PMCC remains focused on managing its portfolio of leased assets in order to maximize financial contributions to Altria. PMCC is not making new investments and expects that its OCI will vary over time as investments mature or are sold.
Altria directly or indirectly owns 100% of each of PM USA, USSTC, Middleton, Ste. Michelle, and PMCC. Altria holds a continuing economic and voting interest in SABMiller.
