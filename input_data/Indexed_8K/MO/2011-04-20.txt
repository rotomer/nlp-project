Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va. April 20, 2011  Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced that its 2011 first-quarter reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 15.4% to $0.45. Reported results increased due primarily to higher operating companies income (OCI) from cigarettes, smokeless products and wine, which included lower asset impairment, exit, integration and implementation costs, higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller plc (SABMiller), due primarily to special items, as well as lower interest and other debt expense, net. These factors were partially offset by lower OCI from cigars. Altria's 2011 first-quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 4.8% to $0.44, as shown in Table 1 below.
"Altria delivered solid financial results in the first quarter as our businesses navigated through high unemployment, low consumer confidence and a competitive business environment," said Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria. "As we anticipated, adjusted EPS growth comparisons for the first quarter were challenging, but our results exceeded our initial expectations and give us confidence in our belief that we can achieve adjusted diluted EPS growth within our forecasted range for the year."
 
Restructuring Charges
Altria incurred pre-tax charges of $6 million and $45 million in the first quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, for asset impairment, exit, integration and implementation costs, as well as costs related to the UST LLC (UST) acquisition. These charges are reflected in the reconciliation section of Schedule 2, and the EPS impact is shown in Table 1 below.
SABMiller Special Items
Altria's earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller were impacted by special items in the first quarters of 2011 and 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, SABMiller special items included pre-tax gains resulting from SABMiller's hotel and gaming transaction, partially offset by pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme." In the first quarter of 2010, SABMiller special items included pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme." These costs and gains after-tax are reflected in Schedule 4, "2011 SABMiller special items" and "2010 SABMiller special items," and the EPS impact is shown in Table 1 below.
Tax Items
Altria recognized a one-time $12 million non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2010 due to the elimination of tax deductions for retiree prescription drug subsidies under the 2010 healthcare legislation. This tax charge is reflected in Schedule 1, "Provision for income taxes," and the EPS impact is shown in Table 1 below.
Altria anticipates that its 2011 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.3%.

Cost Management
Altria and its companies achieved cost savings of $35 million in the first quarter of 2011. Altria expects to achieve approximately $110 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011 for total anticipated cost reductions of $1.5 billion versus 2006.
Pension Plans Contribution
Altria's pension plans were 81% funded on a Projected Benefit Obligation basis at the end of 2010. As previously announced, Altria made a voluntary $200 million pre-tax contribution to its pension plans in January 2011.
Share Repurchase Program
As previously announced, Altria's Board of Directors (Board) authorized a $1 billion one-year share repurchase program in January 2011. No shares were repurchased as part of this program in the first quarter of 2011. Stock repurchases under this program depend upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board.
2011 Full-Year Guidance
The business environment for 2011 is likely to remain challenging, as adult consumers remain under economic pressure and face high unemployment. Altria's tobacco operating companies face a number of uncertainties in 2011. In the cigarettes segment, Philip Morris USA (PM USA) is continuing to see significant competitive activity and remains cautious about the outlook for state excise tax increases. In the smokeless products segment, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (USSTC) began executing its plans for during the first quarter of 2011. In the cigars segment, John Middleton Co. (Middleton) faces an especially challenging business environment.

Altria reaffirms its 2011 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.06. This forecast includes estimated net charges of $0.01 per share related to SABMiller special items.
Altria reaffirms its 2011 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes these special items, to be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07, representing a growth rate of 6% to 9%
 
from an adjusted base of $1.90 in 2010. Altria's 2011 first-quarter adjusted diluted EPS results exceeded management's expectations, due in part to trade inventory dynamics. The trade inventory build in the first quarter of 2011 could negatively impact the cigarettes segment's future income and volume results if it is depleted. As a result, Altria expects unevenness in its 2011 adjusted diluted EPS growth on a quarterly basis, with more growth towards the back half of the year.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. Reconciliations of full-year reported and adjusted diluted EPS guidance are shown in Table 2 below.

Conference Call
A conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on April 20, 2011 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.Access to the webcast is available at www.altria.com.
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Altria's management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Altria's management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations because such items can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures to help investors analyze underlying business performance and trends. Such adjusted measures are regularly provided to
 
and used by management in the evaluation of segment performance and allocation of resources. For a reconciliation of OCI to operating income, see the Consolidated Statements of Earnings contained in this release. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are also provided in the release. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
Altria's reporting segments are Cigarettes, manufactured by PM USA; Smokeless Products, manufactured by or on behalf of USSTC and PM USA; Cigars, manufactured by Middleton; Wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (Ste. Michelle); and Financial Services, provided by Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC).
In the first quarter of 2011, Altria's net revenues decreased 2.0% to $5.6 billion due primarily to lower net revenues from cigarettes and cigars, and revenues net of excise taxes were essentially flat. Operating income increased 7.6% to $1.5 billion due primarily to higher OCI from cigarettes, smokeless products and wine, which included lower asset impairment, exit, integration and implementation costs. Net earnings attributable to Altria increased 15.3% to $0.9 billion due primarily to higher operating income, higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller, due primarily to the special items discussed above, as well as lower interest and other debt expense, net, as a result of debt refinancing activities in 2010.
The cigarettes segment's 2011 first-quarter financial, shipment volume and retail share results were impacted by several factors. OCI and shipment volume results for the first quarter of 2011 benefited from trade inventory movements, and retail share was impacted by the timing of new product launches. PM USA believes that the trade built inventory levels in both the first quarters of 2011 and 2010; however, the estimated 2011 trade inventory build was lower compared to 2010. Additionally, the cigarettes segment's 2010 first-quarter retail share results benefited from the January 2010 introduction of two Special Blend products. PM USA began shipping two additional new Special Blend products in late February 2011, which minimally impacted retail share results for the first quarter of this year.

In the first quarter of 2011, the cigarettes segment's net revenues declined 1.9% due primarily to lower volume, partially offset by higher list prices. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 0.4%. Reported OCI for the cigarettes segment increased 9.5% due primarily to higher list prices and lower asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, partially offset by lower
 
shipment volume and higher U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fees. Excluding restructuring costs, which were primarily related to the previously announced closure of PM USA's Cabarrus manufacturing facility, adjusted OCI increased 7.1%. Revenues and OCI for the cigarettes segment are summarized in Table 3 below.

In the first quarter of 2011, PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 6.4%. After adjusting primarily for changes in trade inventories, PM USA's domestic shipment cigarette volume was estimated to be down approximately 5%. Total cigarette category volume for the first quarter of 2011 was down an estimated 4%, when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's cigarette volume performance is summarized in Table 4 below.

Special Blend products, which began shipping at the end of February 2011, had a minimal impact on the brand's retail share in the first quarter of 2011. PM USA's retail share for the three-month period decreased 1.2 share points due primarily to share losses on and some of PM USA's portfolio brands. PM USA's cigarette retail share performance is summarized in Table 5 below.

The panel was not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the Internet and direct mail.
The smokeless products segment's 2011 first-quarter financial, shipment volume and retail share comparisons were impacted primarily by new product launches and promotional product introductions. The smokeless products segment's 2010 first-quarter results benefited from the launch of new products, the national introduction of Snus and a Slim Can pouch promotion. The smokeless products segment's 2011 first-quarter results did not benefit to the same degree from new product activity due to the timing and size of the launches on several and smokeless products in the quarter.

In the first quarter of 2011, the smokeless products segment's net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes decreased 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively, due primarily to lower shipment volume and costs for brand-building initiatives, partially offset by higher pricing. Reported OCI for the smokeless products segment increased 8.4% due primarily to higher pricing, and lower asset impairment, exit and integration costs, partially offset by increased costs for brand-building initiatives. Excluding restructuring and UST acquisition-related costs, adjusted OCI for the smokeless products segment increased 3.2%. Revenues and OCI for the smokeless products segment are summarized in Table 6 below.

In the first quarter of 2011, USSTC and PM USA's combined reported domestic smokeless products shipment volume declined 1.3% due primarily to negative comparisons on and Snus, partially offset by 's volume growth. Both and Snus volume in the year-ago period benefited from product introductions, while 's volume in this year's first quarter benefited from its X-tra and Snus new product introductions. After adjusting for these factors, USSTC and PM USA's combined domestic smokeless products shipment volume was estimated to be up approximately 6%. USSTC and PM USA believe that the smokeless category's volume grew at an estimated rate of 7%. USSTC and PM USA's combined volume performance for domestic smokeless products is summarized in Table 7 below.

USSTC and PM USA's combined retail share of smokeless products for the first quarter of 2011 declined 0.6 share points to 54.7%. The retail share decline was due primarily to share losses on , partially offset by share gains on .

Note: Retail share performance is based on data from the SymphonyIRI Group (SymphonyIRI) InfoScan Smokeless Tobacco Database for Food, Drug, Mass Merchandisers (excluding Wal-Mart) and Convenience trade classes, which tracks smokeless products market share performance based on the number of cans and packs sold. Smokeless Products is defined as moist smokeless and spit-less tobacco products. Other includes USSTC and PM USA smokeless tobacco products. New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configuration of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can for can basis. USSTC and PM USA have assumed that one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is equivalent to one can of MST.

The cigars segment's 2011 first-quarter financial results were negatively impacted by events following the 2009 federal excise tax (FET) increase on tobacco products. Middleton observed increased competitive activity, including significantly higher levels of imported, low-priced machine-made large cigars. Middleton responded with promotional investments to defend its position in the marketplace.
In the first quarter of 2011, the cigars segment's net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes decreased 13.3% and 24.1%, respectively, due primarily to increased promotional investments. The cigars segment's reported OCI decreased 53.2% due to these promotional investments. Excluding integration costs, the cigars segment's adjusted OCI decreased 54.2%. Revenues and OCI for the cigars segment are summarized in Table 9 below.
Table 9 - Cigars: Revenues and OCI ($ in Millions)
 
 
Middleton's 2011 first-quarter reported cigar shipment volume increased 1.9% due primarily to 's retail share performance. Increases in imported machine-made large cigars have made trade inventory volumes difficult to determine accurately in the short-term. As a result, Middleton is only providing its reported company shipments. Middleton's volume performance for cigars is summarized in Table 10 below.

The wine segment's 2011 first-quarter net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes increased 6.3% and 6.6%, respectively, due primarily to higher premium shipment volume. The wine segment's 2011 first-quarter reported OCI increased 71.4% due primarily to higher premium shipment volume, as well as lower integration and UST acquisition-related costs. Excluding those restructuring costs, the wine segment's 2011 first-quarter adjusted OCI increased 25.0%. Revenues and OCI for the wine segment are summarized in Table 12 below.
 
Table 12 - Wine: Revenues and OCI ($ in Millions)
 
 
In the first quarter of 2011, Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume increased 0.4%, benefiting from higher off- and on-premise channel volume, partially offset by changes in trade inventories. Ste. Michelle believes that in the first quarter of 2011 wholesalers depleted inventories that were built in the fourth quarter of 2010. In the comparable year-ago quarter, wholesalers increased inventory levels, creating a difficult first-quarter shipment comparison. Ste. Michelle's reported volume performance for wine is summarized in Table 13 below.

Note: Percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest hundred.
Ste. Michelle's 2011 first-quarter retail unit volume increased 2.3%, while the total wine industry's retail unit volume for the three-month period increased 3.2%. Ste. Michelle and total wine industry retail unit volume change is summarized in Table 14 below.
 
Table 14 - Wine Retail Unit Volume Change (Percent)
 
Note: Retail unit volume percentage change is based on data from The Nielsen Company (Nielsen) and its Nielsen Total Wine Database  U.S. Food, Drug & Liquor, which tracks retail metrics in the wine space. It is Nielsen's standard practice to periodically refresh its syndicated databases, which could restate retail metrics that were previously released.
Reported 2011 first-quarter OCI for the financial services segment was unchanged at $21 million. The allowance for losses at the end of the first quarter of 2011 was $202 million, unchanged versus the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. PMCC remains focused on managing its portfolio of leased assets in order to maximize financial contributions to Altria. PMCC is not making new investments and expects that its OCI will vary over time as investments mature or are sold.
The previously disclosed litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to tax benefits claimed for certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions, referred to by the IRS as lease-in/lease-out (LILO) and sale-in/lease-out (SILO) transactions, that PMCC entered into from 1996 through 2003 is still ongoing. For the period January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2011, the disallowance of federal and state income tax benefits and associated interest related to PMCC's LILO and SILO transactions would be approximately $1.1 billion, taking into account federal and state income taxes paid or payable on gains associated with sales of leased assets during that period and excluding potential penalties. The payment, if any, of this amount would depend upon the timing and outcome of future IRS audits and any related administrative challenges or litigation.
Should Altria not prevail in these matters, Altria may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal and state income taxes, pay associated interest costs and penalties, if imposed, and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases, which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. A recalculation of income for all the affected leases, if required, would result in a one-time charge against reported earnings of approximately $650 million (excluding potential penalties) in the quarter in which the recalculation occurred. Approximately 50% of this charge would represent a reduction in
 
cumulative lease earnings booked to date that would be recaptured over the remainder of the affected lease terms. The remaining portion of the earnings charge would represent a permanent charge for interest on tax underpayments.
Altria directly or indirectly owns 100% of each of PM USA, USSTC, Middleton, Ste. Michelle, and PMCC. Altria holds a continuing economic and voting interest in SABMiller.
The brand portfolios of Altria's tobacco operating companies include such well-known names as , , and. Ste.

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release and today's remarks are described in Altria's publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
These factors include the following: Altria's tobacco businesses (PM USA, USSTC and Middleton) are subject to price competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and cost; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; legislation, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases and concluded tobacco litigation settlements on trade inventories, consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to
 
environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and, from time to time, governmental and grand jury investigations.
Furthermore, the results of Altria's tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to government regulation, including broad-based regulation of PM USA and USSTC by the FDA. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies' understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.
Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make other than in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
