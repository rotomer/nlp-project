"Altria continued to reward its shareholders through dividends and its share repurchase program. Altria repurchased 22.8 million shares in the second-quarter and paid almost $1.6
 
billion in dividends in the first half of 2011. We believe that our business results through June put us on track to achieve the 2011 full-year reported and adjusted diluted EPS guidance."
Conference Call
A conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on July 20, 2011 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Access to the webcast is available at altria.com.
Cost Management
Altria and its companies achieved cost savings of $80 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $115 million in the first half of 2011. Altria expects to achieve at least $30 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011 and is on track to exceed its goal of $1.5 billion in cost reductions versus 2006.
Share Repurchase Program
Altria began repurchasing shares of its common stock in the second quarter of 2011 as part of its previously announced $1 billion 2011 one-year share repurchase program. Altria repurchased 22.8 million shares at an average price of $27.07 for a total cost of $616 million. Share repurchases under this program depend upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of Altria's Board of Directors.
Debt and Revolving Credit Agreement
In the second quarter of 2011, Altria issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.75%. The notes mature in May 2021.
Altria also entered into a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion and expires on June 30, 2016. The credit agreement replaced Altria's $600 million senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit agreement, which was to expire on November 16, 2011, and Altria's $2.4 billion senior unsecured three-year revolving credit agreement, which was to expire on November 20, 2012.
2011 Full-Year Guidance
Altria reaffirms its 2011 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS, which was previously revised in June 2011 in connection with a Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) leveraged lease charge, to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.76. This forecast includes estimated net charges of $0.31 per share related to a PMCC leveraged lease charge and SABMiller plc (SABMiller) special items.
 
Altria reaffirms its 2011 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes special items, to be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07, representing a growth rate of 6% to 9% from an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Altria's 2011 first-half adjusted diluted EPS results exceeded management's expectations, due in part to trade inventory dynamics and higher equity earnings from Altria's investment in SABMiller. Philip Morris USA (PM USA) believes that the trade has begun to deplete cigarette inventories built in the second quarter and first half of 2011, and expects this depletion to negatively impact PM USA's 2011 third-quarter cigarette shipment volume and income. As a result, Altria expects its quarterly adjusted diluted EPS growth to be stronger in the fourth quarter of 2011 than in the third quarter of 2011. Altria anticipates that 2011 second-half adjusted diluted EPS growth will be higher than the first half of 2011.
The business environment for 2011 is likely to remain challenging, as adult consumers remain under economic pressure and face high unemployment. Altria's tobacco operating companies continue to face significant competitive activity. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. Reconciliations of full-year reported to adjusted diluted EPS guidance are shown in Table 1 below.

* Excludes exit and integration costs; ** Excludes the tax impact included in the 2011 PMCC leveraged lease charge
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Altria's management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Altria's management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are
 
not part of underlying operations because such items can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures to help investors analyze underlying business performance and trends. Such adjusted measures are regularly provided to and used by management in the evaluation of segment performance and allocation of resources. For a reconciliation of OCI to operating income, see the Consolidated Statements of Earnings contained in this release. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are also provided in the release. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
Altria's reporting segments are Cigarettes, manufactured and sold by PM USA; Smokeless Products, manufactured and sold by or on behalf of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (USSTC) and PM USA; Cigars, manufactured and sold by John Middleton Co. (Middleton); Wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (Ste. Michelle); and Financial Services, provided by PMCC.
Altria's net revenues in the second quarter and first half of 2011 decreased 5.6% to $5.9 billion and 3.9% to $11.6 billion, respectively, primarily due to lower net revenues from financial services as a result of the previously announced one-time charge related to certain leveraged lease transactions. Revenues net of excise taxes in the second quarter and first half of 2011 decreased 7.8% to $4.0 billion and 4.2% to $7.9 billion, respectively.
Altria's reported diluted EPS in the second quarter and first half of 2011 decreased 58.0% and 25.8%, respectively, primarily due to the one-time leveraged lease charge, partially offset by higher OCI from cigarettes, smokeless products and wine, which included lower asset impairment, exit, integration and implementation costs, and higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller.
Altria's 2011 second-quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 6.0% to $0.53, and increased 5.4% to $0.97 in the first half of 2011 as shown in Table 3 below.
Restructuring Charges
Altria's EPS comparisons of the second quarter and first half were impacted by restructuring charges. Altria's operating companies incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $3 million and $54 million in the second quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $9 million and $99 million in the first half of 2011 and 2010, respectively, for asset impairment, exit, integration and implementation costs, as well as costs related to the UST LLC (UST) acquisition. These
 
charges are reflected in the reconciliation sections of Schedules 2 and 4. The EPS impact of these charges is shown in Table 3 below.
SABMiller Special Items
Comparisons of Altria's earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller in the second quarter and first half of 2011 and 2010 were impacted by special items. SABMiller special items in the second quarter and first half of 2011 included pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme" and asset impairment charges. The 2011 first-half costs and charges were partially offset by pre-tax gains resulting from SABMiller's hotel and gaming transaction. SABMiller's special items in the second quarter and first half of 2010 included pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme" and its transaction to promote sustainable economic and social development in South Africa. These special items after-tax are reflected in Schedules 6 and 7, "2011 SABMiller special items" and "2010 SABMiller special items," and the EPS impact of these special items is shown in Table 3 below.
PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge
As previously announced in June 2011, Altria's 2011 second-quarter and first-half EPS were impacted by a one-time charge of $627 million related to the tax treatment of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by Altria's subsidiary, PMCC. Approximately 50% of the charge ($315 million), which does not include potential penalties, represents a reduction in cumulative lease earnings booked to date that will be recaptured over the remainder of the affected lease terms. The remaining portion of the charge ($312 million) primarily represents a permanent charge for interest on tax underpayments. This one-time charge was recorded as shown in Table 2 below, and the EPS impact is shown below in Table 3.
 
The reduction to cumulative lease earnings was recorded as a pre-tax charge of $490 million against PMCC's net revenues, which is reflected in the reconciliation sections of Schedules 2 and 4.
 
A net increase of $137 million was recorded to the provision for income taxes, and included in Schedules 1 and 3, "Provision for income taxes." This portion of the charge primarily represents net interest on tax underpayments, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with the reduction in cumulative lease earnings.
Tax Items
As a result of the interest on tax underpayments related to the PMCC leveraged lease charge discussed above, Altria's reported income tax rate was 61.6% in the second quarter of 2011, and 47.0% in the first half of 2011. Excluding 2011 second-quarter and first-half tax items, Altria's income tax rates for the second quarter and first half of 2011 are consistent with its forecasted full-year effective tax rate on operations of approximately 35%.
In addition to the 2011 tax impact of the PMCC leveraged lease charge, provision for income taxes and EPS comparisons of the second-quarter and first-half periods were impacted by 2010 tax events. In the second quarter and first half of 2010, Altria recorded net tax benefits of $58 million and $46 million, respectively, primarily from the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest related to the closure of various federal and state audits. These 2010 net tax benefits are reflected in Schedules 1 and 3, "Provision for income taxes," and the EPS impact of these net tax benefits is shown in Table 3 below. Comparisons of the second-quarter and first-half periods also reflect a 2010 tax event consisting of the reversal of tax reserves and interest of $169 million related to Altria's former subsidiaries, Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI), which are reflected in Schedules 1 and 3, "Provision for income taxes." This $169 million tax benefit was fully offset by reductions of corresponding receivables from Kraft and PMI, which are also reflected in Schedules 1 and 3, "Reduction of Kraft and PMI tax-related receivables." Although there was no impact on Altria's net earnings associated with the resolution of the Kraft and PMI tax matters, the resolution had a favorable impact on 2010 income tax rates.

The cigarettes segment delivered solid adjusted OCI growth with strong adjusted OCI margins in the second quarter and first half of 2011 behind 's performance. grew its 2011 second-quarter retail share sequentially as the brand benefited from recent new product introductions and the strength of its menthol business. Reported shipment volume in the second quarter and first half of 2011 benefited from trade inventory movements.

The cigarettes segment's net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes in the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased primarily due to higher list prices, partially offset by lower shipment volume. Net revenues in the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased 2.1% and 0.2%, respectively, and revenues net of excise taxes in the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased 3.6% and 2.1%, respectively.
Reported OCI for the cigarettes segment in the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased 5.9% and 7.6%, respectively, primarily due to higher list prices and lower asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fees and a $36 million charge for the case. Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs that were primarily related to the previously announced closure of PM USA's Cabarrus manufacturing facility, increased 2.8% in the second quarter of 2011 and grew 4.8% in the first half of 2011.

Adjusted OCI margins for the cigarettes segment, which include the impact of a $36 million charge for the case, declined 0.3 percentage points to 39.7% in the second quarter of 2011, and increased 1.0 percentage point to 39.6% in the first half of 2011. Revenues and OCI for the cigarettes segment are summarized in Table 4 below.

PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume in the second quarter and first half of 2011 declined 0.7% and 3.5%, respectively, primarily due to different trade inventory dynamics compared to the year-ago periods. PM USA believes that the trade built inventory levels in both the second quarter and first half of 2011, which benefited PM USA's shipment volume. In 2010, PM USA believes the trade increased inventories in the first quarter, and following PM USA's list price increases in the second quarter of 2010, decreased inventory levels on PM USA's brands. After adjusting primarily for changes in trade inventories, PM USA's domestic shipment cigarette volume in the second quarter and first half of 2011 was estimated to be down approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Total cigarette category volume in both the second quarter and first half of 2011 was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's cigarette volume performance is summarized in Table 5 below.
 
Note: Volume includes units sold as well as promotional units, but excludes Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, Overseas Military, and Philip Morris Duty Free Inc.; percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest million.
 
On a sequential basis, 's 2011 second-quarter retail share grew 0.4 share points versus the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to retail share growth on Menthol, and its new Special Blend products. On a year-over-year basis, 's retail share in the second quarter and first half of 2011 decreased 0.2 and 0.3 share points, respectively, versus its record retail share results in the prior-year periods.

In the first half of 2010, wholesalers increased inventory levels, creating a difficult shipment comparison. Ste. Michelle's reported shipment volume performance for wine is summarized in Table 16 below.
 
Note: Percent volume change calculation is based on units to the nearest hundred.
Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume in the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased 1.6% and 2.0%, respectively. The total wine industry's retail unit volume in both the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased 3.2%. Ste. Michelle and total wine industry retail unit volume change is summarized in Table 17 below.
 
Note: Retail unit volume percentage change is based on data from The Nielsen Company (Nielsen) and its Nielsen Total Wine Database  U.S. Food, Drug & Liquor, which tracks retail metrics in the wine space. It is Nielsen's standard practice to periodically refresh its syndicated databases, which could restate retail metrics that were previously released.
Reported OCI for the financial services segment in the second quarter and first half of 2011 decreased primarily due to a 2011 second-quarter charge of $490 million related to certain leveraged lease transactions and lower gains on asset sales. Financial services reported an operating companies loss in the second quarter and first half of 2011 of $463 million and $442 million, respectively, a decrease in income of $502 million for each period. Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding the leveraged lease charge, was $27 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $48 million in the first half of 2011. OCI for the financial services segment is summarized in Table 18 below.
 
The allowance for losses at the end of the second quarter of 2011 was $202 million, unchanged versus the end of the first quarter of 2011. PMCC remains focused on managing its portfolio of leased assets in order to maximize financial contributions to Altria. PMCC is not making new investments and expects that its OCI will vary over time as investments mature or are sold.

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release are described in Altria's publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011.
These factors include the following: Altria's tobacco businesses (PM USA, USSTC and Middleton) are subject to price competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and cost; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; legislation, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases and concluded tobacco litigation settlements on trade inventories, consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and, from time to time, governmental and grand jury investigations.
 
Furthermore, the results of Altria's tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to government regulation, including broad-based regulation of PM USA and USSTC by the FDA. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies' understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.
Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make other than in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
