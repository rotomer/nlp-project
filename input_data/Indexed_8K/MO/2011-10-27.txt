Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
RICHMOND, Va.  October 27, 2011  Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced its results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, and its plans for new share repurchase and cost reduction programs.
"Altria made significant progress in the third quarter on its plans to continue delivering strong returns to shareholders," said Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria. "The company increased its dividend 7.9% and grew third-quarter adjusted diluted EPS 3.7%, and our consumer products businesses continued to expand their adjusted operating margins."
"Yesterday, Altria's Board of Directors (Board) approved two new initiatives that build on this year's progress and support our goal of delivering average annual adjusted diluted EPS
 
growth of 7% to 9% over time," said Mr. Szymanczyk. "The Board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which we plan to complete by the end of 2012, as part of Altria's ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders."
"We have also announced a new cost reduction program that is primarily focused on cigarette-related infrastructure costs," said Mr. Szymanczyk. "Cigarette industry volume has declined significantly following the 158% increase in the federal excise tax in April 2009, resulting in our need to continue reducing cigarette-related infrastructure. This new cost reduction program is expected to deliver $400 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2013."
"Altria grew its adjusted diluted EPS 6.1% in 2009 and 8.6% in 2010, and expects to grow its 2011 full-year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 6% to 9%. Altria believes that the ongoing performance of its businesses, along with its new share repurchase and cost reduction initiatives, will allow it to deliver 2012 adjusted diluted EPS growth consistent with this past performance."
Conference Call
A conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on October 27, 2011 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Access to the webcast is available at altria.com.
Cost Management
Altria completed its 2007 to 2011 cost reduction program in the third quarter as the company exceeded its $1.5 billion goal versus its 2006 cost base.
Altria announced today that it is initiating a new cost reduction program for its tobacco and service company subsidiaries, reflecting Altria's objective to reduce cigarette-related infrastructure ahead of Philip Morris USA Inc.'s (PM USA) cigarette volume declines. The program is expected to deliver $400 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2013. Altria estimates total pre-tax restructuring charges in connection with this new program of approximately $375 million, with approximately $340 million or $0.11 per share to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the balance in 2012. The estimated charges, substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures, relate primarily to employee separation costs of approximately $300 million, and other associated costs of approximately $75 million including lease termination and asset impairment. These estimated charges do not reflect the non-cash impact which may result from pension settlement and curtailment accounting.
 
Cash Returns to Shareholders - Share Repurchase Program
Altria completed its previously announced $1 billion 2011 share repurchase program in the third quarter. During this program Altria repurchased 37.6 million shares at an average price of $26.62. In the third quarter of 2011, Altria repurchased 14.8 million shares at an average price of $25.93 for a total cost of $384 million.
On October 26, 2011, Altria's Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which Altria intends to complete by the end of 2012. Share repurchases under this new program depend upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board.
Cash Returns to Shareholders - Dividends
In August 2011, Altria announced that its Board voted to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 7.9% to $0.41 per common share versus the previous rate of $0.38 per common share. The current annualized dividend rate is $1.64 per common share, and as of October 21, 2011, Altria's annualized dividend yield was 6.0%. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of the Board.
2011 Full-Year Guidance
Altria revises its 2011 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS from a range of $1.70 to $1.76 to a range of $1.60 to $1.66, primarily due to estimated 2011 fourth-quarter charges associated with the new cost reduction program. This forecast includes estimated total net charges of $0.41 per share related to the previously disclosed Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) leveraged lease charge, the new cost reduction program, SABMiller plc (SABMiller) special items and tax items.
Altria reaffirms its 2011 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes special items, to be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07, representing a growth rate of 6% to 9% from an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. Reconciliations of full-year reported to adjusted diluted EPS guidance are shown in Table 1 below.
 
Table 1 - Altria's Full-Year Earnings Per Share Guidance Excluding Special Items
 
 
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Altria's management reviews operating companies income (OCI), which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Altria's management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations because such items can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures to help investors analyze underlying business performance and trends. Such adjusted measures are regularly provided to and used by management in the evaluation of segment performance and allocation of resources. For a reconciliation of OCI to operating income, see the Consolidated Statements of Earnings contained in this release. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are also provided in the release. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
Altria's reporting segments are Cigarettes, manufactured and sold by PM USA; Smokeless Products, manufactured and sold by or on behalf of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (USSTC) and PM USA; Cigars, manufactured and sold by John Middleton Co. (Middleton); Wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (Ste. Michelle); and Financial Services, provided by PMCC.
Altria's 2011 third-quarter net revenues decreased 4.6% to $6.1 billion due to lower net revenues from cigarettes, partially offset by higher net revenues from smokeless products,
 
cigars, wine and financial services. Revenues net of excise taxes in the third quarter decreased 3.0% to $4.3 billion.
For the first nine months of 2011, Altria's net revenues declined 4.1% to $17.7 billion, primarily due to lower net revenues from financial services, as a result of the second-quarter charge related to certain leveraged lease transactions, and cigarettes, partially offset by higher net revenues from smokeless products and wine. Revenues net of excise taxes for the first nine months of 2011 decreased 3.8% to $12.3 billion. Revenues net of excise taxes for Altria's combined tobacco and wine businesses for the first nine months of 2011 were essentially unchanged.
Altria's reported 2011 third-quarter diluted EPS increased 5.6%, primarily due to higher OCI from financial services, smokeless products, cigars and wine, higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller and fewer shares outstanding. These factors were partially offset by lower OCI from cigarettes, higher general corporate expenses and higher interest and other debt expense, net. Altria's 2011 third-quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 3.7% to $0.56 as shown in Table 2 below.
For the first nine months of 2011, Altria's reported diluted EPS declined 14.0%, primarily due to the second-quarter charge related to certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions, higher general corporate expenses and lower OCI from cigars, partially offset by higher OCI from cigarettes, smokeless products and wine, and higher earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller. Altria's adjusted diluted EPS for the first nine months of 2011 grew 4.8% to $1.53 as shown in Table 2 below. Both reported and adjusted diluted EPS for the first nine months of 2011 include a $0.01 per share charge related to the case.

Restructuring Charges
Altria's EPS comparisons of the third quarter and first nine months were impacted by restructuring charges. Altria's operating companies incurred pre-tax charges of $2 million and $32 million in the third quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $11 million and $131 million for the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively, for asset impairment, exit, integration and implementation costs, as well as costs related to the UST LLC (UST) acquisition. These charges are reflected in the reconciliation sections of Schedules 2 and 4. The EPS impact of these charges is shown in Table 2 below.
 
SABMiller Special Items
Comparisons of Altria's earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller in the third quarter and first nine months were impacted by special items. SABMiller special items in the third quarters of 2011 and 2010 included pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme." For the first nine months of 2011, SABMiller special items included pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme" and asset impairment charges, partially offset by pre-tax gains resulting from its hotel and gaming transaction. SABMiller special items in the first nine months of 2010 included pre-tax costs for its "business capability programme" and its transaction to promote sustainable economic and social development in South Africa. These special items after-tax are reflected in Schedules 6 and 7, "2011 SABMiller special items" and "2010 SABMiller special items," and the EPS impact of these special items is shown in Table 2 below.
PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge
Altria's EPS comparisons of the first nine months were impacted by a one-time charge of $627 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to the tax treatment of certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions. The EPS impact of the charge is shown in Table 2 below. A reduction to cumulative lease earnings was recorded as a pre-tax charge of $490 million against PMCC's net revenues, which is reflected in the reconciliation section of Schedule 4. A net increase of $137 million was recorded to the provision for income taxes and included in Schedule 3, "Provision for income taxes," which primarily represents interest on tax underpayments, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with the reduction in cumulative lease earnings.
Tax Items
In the third quarter of 2011 and 2010, Altria recorded net tax benefits of $24 million and $33 million, respectively, and excluding the tax impact of the PMCC leveraged lease charge discussed above, for the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, Altria recorded net tax benefits of $24 million and $79 million, respectively. These net tax benefits resulted primarily from the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest related to the expiration of statutes of limitations, closure of tax audits and reversal of tax accruals no longer required. These net tax benefits are reflected in Schedules 1 and 3, "Provision for income taxes," and the EPS impact of these net benefits is shown in Table 2 below.
 
Tax comparisons of the third quarter and first nine months also include the impact of tax matters related to Altria's former subsidiaries, Kraft Foods Inc. (Kraft) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI), which are reflected in Schedules 1 and 3, "Provision for income taxes." In the third quarter of 2011, Altria recorded a tax provision of $19 million related to various Kraft tax matters. In the second quarter of 2010, Altria recorded a tax benefit of $169 million consisting of the reversal of tax reserves and interest related to Kraft and PMI tax matters. These amounts were fully offset by changes to the corresponding receivables from Kraft and PMI, which are also reflected in Schedules 1 and 3, "Changes to Kraft and PMI tax-related receivables." Although there was no impact on Altria's net earnings associated with the Kraft and PMI tax matters, these items impacted the income tax rate for the third quarter of 2011 and the first nine months of 2011 and 2010.
Excluding the tax items discussed above, Altria's income tax rates in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 were consistent with its forecasted full-year effective tax rate on operations of approximately 35%.

PM USA delivered strong adjusted OCI margin growth in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. Trade inventory dynamics impacted PM USA's third-quarter net revenues, income and volume results. PM USA's 2011 first-half results benefited from the trade building cigarette inventory levels, and PM USA believes that the trade depleted these inventories in the third quarter, which negatively impacted PM USA's third-quarter revenues, OCI and volume comparisons. Relative changes in manufacturers' promotional activities in the third quarter
 
impacted 's retail share performance, as PM USA focused on adjusted OCI margin expansion.

The cigarettes segment's net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 decreased, primarily due to lower shipment volume, partially offset by higher list prices. Net revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 decreased 7.0% and 2.3%, respectively, and revenues net of excise taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 declined 6.0% and 0.8%, respectively.
Reported OCI for the cigarettes segment in the third quarter of 2011 decreased 0.8% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to lower shipment volume, which includes the impact of trade inventory depletions discussed above, and higher U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fees, partially offset by higher list prices and lower asset impairment, exit and implementation costs. Reported OCI for the cigarettes segment for the first nine months of 2011 grew 4.5% to $4.4 billion, primarily due to higher list prices and lower asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher FDA user fees and the $36 million charge for the case. Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding restructuring costs but including the impact of the charge, declined 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011, but grew 2.2% for the first nine months of 2011.

Adjusted OCI margins for the cigarettes segment increased 1.5 percentage points to 41.7% in the third quarter of 2011. For the first nine months of 2011, adjusted OCI margins, which include the impact of the $36 million charge for the case, increased 1.1 percentage points to 40.3%. Revenues and OCI for the cigarettes segment are summarized in Table 3 below.

PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume in the third quarter of 2011 declined 9.0%, primarily due to trade inventory dynamics and retail share losses. PM USA believes that third-quarter volume comparisons were negatively impacted because the trade depleted cigarette inventories in the third-quarter that had been built in the first half of 2011. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume for the first nine months of 2011 declined 5.4%.
After adjusting for changes in trade inventories, PM USA's domestic cigarette shipment volume in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 was estimated to be down approximately 5%. Total cigarette category volume was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's cigarette volume performance is summarized in Table 4 below.

'sretail share in the third quarter decreased 0.9 share points from last year's strong retail share results, primarily due to relative changes in manufacturers' promotional activities. Following PM USA's July 2011 list price increase, 'sthird-quarter retail price increased more than major competitive premium and discount brands as PM USA focused on growing its adjusted OCI margins. PM USA's retail share in the third quarter declined 0.9 share points primarily due to share losses on . For the first nine months of 2011, PM USA and 'sretail share declined 1.0 and 0.6 share points, respectively, as had delivered record retail share results in the first nine months of 2010 that were achieved at lower adjusted OCI margin levels.

The smokeless products segment's net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 increased primarily due to higher pricing. Net revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 increased 9.5% and 4.2%, respectively, and revenues net of excise taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 increased 9.6% and 4.3%, respectively.
 
Reported OCI for the smokeless products segment in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 increased 16.7% and 12.6%, respectively, primarily due to higher pricing and lower selling, general & administrative costs (SG&A). Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding restructuring and UST acquisition-related costs, increased 15.5% in the third quarter of 2011 and grew 10.1% in the first nine months of 2011.
Adjusted OCI margins for the smokeless products segment increased primarily due to higher pricing, improving volume mix into and , and lower SG&A costs.

The financial services segment's 2011 third-quarter reported OCI was $83 million, an increase of $56 million, primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for losses and higher gains on asset sales. In the third quarter of 2011, PMCC decreased its allowance for losses based on management's assessment of the credit quality of its leasing portfolio, resulting in a $35 million increase in OCI in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The allowance for losses at the end of the third quarter of 2011 was $167 million versus $202 million at the end of the second quarter of 2011.
For the first nine months of 2011, the financial services segment reported an operating companies loss of $359 million primarily due to the 2011 second-quarter charge of $490 million related to certain leveraged lease transactions. Adjusted OCI for the first nine months of 2011, which is calculated excluding the PMCC leveraged lease charge, was $131 million, an increase of $44 million, primarily due to higher gains on asset sales and the decrease in the allowance for losses. OCI for the financial services segment is summarized in Table 14 below.

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release are described in Altria's publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011.
These factors include the following: Altria's tobacco businesses (PM USA, USSTC and Middleton) are subject to price competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and cost; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; legislation, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases and concluded tobacco litigation settlements on trade inventories, consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and, from time to time, governmental investigations.
Furthermore, the results of Altria's tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to federal, state and local government regulation, including broad-based regulation of PM USA and USSTC by the FDA. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and
 
judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies' understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.
Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make except as required by applicable law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
