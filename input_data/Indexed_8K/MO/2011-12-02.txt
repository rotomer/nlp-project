On December 2, 2011, Altria Group, Inc. ("Altria") issued a press release (the "Press Release"), in which Altria announced, among other things, that it will record a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of $62 million related to tobacco and health judgments in the and cases as well as incurring approximately $57 million in interest costs related to those two cases. The and cases were described in detail in Altria's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2011 that Altria filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Altria revises its 2011 full-year guidance for reported diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from a range of $1.60 to $1.66 to a range of $1.58 to $1.64, primarily due to 2011 fourth-quarter charges of four cents per share associated with the tobacco and health judgments related to the and cases, partially offset by favorability related to tax items.

Altria reports its diluted EPS in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Previously, Altria also disclosed adjusted diluted EPS, which measured Altria's diluted EPS, excluding among other items, certain Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC") leveraged lease charges, SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") special items, restructuring charges, and certain tax items. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, Altria will redefine its adjusted diluted EPS to also exclude charges for tobacco and health judgments. Altria's management does not view these items to be part of our sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management believes that the redefined adjusted diluted EPS measure will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS. Altria's management uses adjusted measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of Altria's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.
In connection with its decision to redefine adjusted diluted EPS as described above, Altria forecasts that 2011 full-year adjusted diluted EPS, as redefined to exclude special items listed in Table 1 of the Press Release, will be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07. This represents a growth rate of 6% to 9% from a 2010 adjusted base of $1.90 per share, which was not impacted by tobacco and health judgment charges.
Altria also announced that it expects this week's American Airlines bankruptcy filing to have a negative impact on PMCC's fourth-quarter financial results. Altria's preliminary estimate of the potential impact of this event is reflected in its 2011 EPS guidance above.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of the Press Release represent continuing risks to this forecast.
A copy of the Press Release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference in its entirety to this Item 7.01.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
As discussed under Item 7.01, on December 2, 2011, Altria Group, Inc. ("Altria") issued a Press Release, in which it announced, among other things, that it will record a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of $62 million related to tobacco and health judgments in the and cases as well as incurring approximately $57 million in interest costs related to those two cases.

The text of the Press Release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report or Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference to this Item 8.01 except for the sections entitled "2011 Full-Year Guidance" and "Restated Adjusted Results." Altria's 2011 Full-Year Guidance is presented below.
2011 Full-Year Guidance
Altria revises its 2011 full-year guidance for reported diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from a range of $1.60 to $1.66 to a range of $1.58 to $1.64, primarily due to 2011 fourth-quarter charges of four cents per share associated with the tobacco and health judgments related to the and cases, partially offset by favorability related to tax items.

This forecast includes estimated net charges of $0.43 per share as detailed in the table below, as compared with 2010 full-year reported diluted EPS of $1.87, which included $0.03 per share of net charges, as detailed in the table below.
Altria reports its diluted EPS in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Previously, Altria also disclosed adjusted diluted EPS, which measured Altria's diluted EPS, excluding among other items, certain Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC") leveraged lease charges, SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") special items, restructuring charges, and certain tax items. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, Altria will redefine its adjusted diluted EPS to also exclude charges for tobacco and health judgments. Altria's management does not view these items to be part of our sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management believes that the redefined adjusted diluted EPS measure will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS. Altria's management uses adjusted measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of Altria's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. Adjusted diluted EPS is a financial measure that is not consistent with U.S. GAAP. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
In connection with its decision to redefine adjusted diluted EPS as described above, Altria forecasts that 2011 full-year adjusted diluted EPS, as redefined, will represent a growth rate of 6% to 9% over the 2010 full-year adjusted diluted EPS, which was not impacted by tobacco and health judgment charges. As set forth in the Press Release, had Altria not redefined its adjusted diluted EPS, it would have revised its 2011 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to 3% to 6% over the 2010 full-year adjusted diluted EPS.
Previously disclosed reported and adjusted diluted EPS results for the four quarters of 2010 as well as the first and third quarters of 2011 were not impacted by tobacco and health judgment charges.
Altria also announced that it expects this week's American Airlines bankruptcy filing to have a negative impact on PMCC's fourth-quarter financial results. Altria's preliminary estimate of the potential impact of this event is reflected in its 2011 EPS guidance above.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of the Press Release represent continuing risks to this forecast.

Disclosure of Financial Results  Redefined Adjusted Diluted EPS
Altria reports its diluted EPS in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Previously, Altria also disclosed adjusted diluted EPS, which measured Altria's diluted EPS, excluding among other items, certain Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) leveraged lease charges, SABMiller plc (SABMiller) special items, restructuring charges, and certain tax items. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, Altria will redefine its adjusted diluted EPS to also exclude charges for tobacco and health judgments. Altria's management does not view these items to be part of our sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management believes that the redefined adjusted diluted EPS measure will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS. Altria's management uses adjusted measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of Altria's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.
2011 Full-Year Guidance
Altria revises its 2011 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS from a range of $1.60 to $1.66 to a range of $1.58 to $1.64, primarily due to 2011 fourth-quarter charges of four cents per share associated with the tobacco and health judgments related to the cases, partially offset by favorability related to tax items.
Williams and Bullock
In connection with its decision to redefine adjusted diluted EPS as described above, Altria forecasts that 2011 full-year adjusted diluted EPS, as redefined to exclude special items listed below in Table 1, will be in the range of $2.01 to $2.07. This represents a growth rate of 6% to 9% from a 2010 adjusted base of $1.90 per share, which was not impacted by tobacco and health judgment charges.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. Reconciliations of full-year reported to original adjusted diluted EPS and to redefined adjusted diluted EPS are shown in Table 1 below.

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release are described in Altria's publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2011.
These factors include the following: Altria's tobacco businesses (PM USA, USSTC and Middleton) are subject to price competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and cost; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; legislation, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases and concluded tobacco litigation settlements on trade inventories, consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and, from time to time, governmental investigations.
Furthermore, the results of Altria's tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to federal, state and local government regulation, including broad-based regulation of PM USA and USSTC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies' understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.
Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make except as required by applicable law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
