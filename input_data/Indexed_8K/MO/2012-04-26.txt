Conference Call
A conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on April 26, 2012 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.Access to the webcast is available at altria.com.
Cost Management
Altria's current cost reduction program for its tobacco and service company subsidiaries remains on track. The program, which was announced in October 2011, is expected to deliver $400 million in annualized savings against previously planned spending by the end of 2013.
 
Altria estimates total net pre-tax restructuring charges in connection with this program of approximately $300 million, substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures, related primarily to employee separation costs of approximately $220 million, and other associated net costs of $80 million. These other associated net costs include lease termination and asset impairment charges, partially offset by a curtailment gain related to a postretirement benefit plan.
Altria recorded net pre-tax charges totaling $228 million over the past two quarters, reflecting restructuring charges of $224 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $4 million in the first quarter of 2012. Altria expects to incur the balance of the pre-tax restructuring charges later in 2012.
Cash Returns to Shareholders  Dividends
In March 2012, Altria's Board of Directors (Board) declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per common share. The current annualized dividend rate is $1.64 per common share. As of April 20, 2012, Altria's annualized dividend yield was 5.1%.
Altria expects to continue to return a large amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends by maintaining a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted EPS. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of the Board.
Cash Returns to ShareholdersShare Repurchase Program
Altria repurchased 9.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $29.71 for a total cost of approximately $294 million during the first quarter of 2012 as part of its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. Altria has $378 million remaining in this program and intends to complete it by the end of 2012. The timing of share repurchases under this program depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board.
Pension Plans Contribution
As previously announced, Altria made a voluntary $500 million contribution to its pension plans in January 2012.
2012 Full-Year Guidance
Altria reaffirms its 2012 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.20. The forecast includes estimated charges of $0.03 per share related to asset impairment, exit and implementation costs related to the cost reduction program announced in October 2011 and estimated charges related to SABMiller plc (SABMiller) special items.
 
Altria reaffirms its 2012 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes special items shown in Table 1 below, to be in the range of $2.17 to $2.23, representing a growth rate of 6% to 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.05 per share in 2011. Altria anticipates more modest adjusted diluted EPS growth through the middle quarters of this year.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. Reconciliations of full-year adjusted to reported diluted EPS are shown in Table 1 below.
Table 1 - Altria's Full-Year Earnings Per Share Guidance Excluding Special Items
 
Altria anticipates that its 2012 full-year reported effective tax rate and effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36%.
2012 Reporting Segments
As previously announced, on January 1, 2012, Altria combined the former cigarettes and cigars segments into a single smokeable products segment. The combination of these two formerly separate segments reflects management's goal to achieve efficiencies in the management of these businesses as part of Altria's cost reduction program. Effective with the first quarter of 2012, Altria's reportable segments are Smokeable Products, manufactured and sold by PM USA and Middleton; Smokeless Products, manufactured and sold by or on behalf of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (USSTC) and PM USA; Wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (Ste. Michelle); and Financial Services, provided by Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC). Prior-period segment data have been recast to conform with the current-period segment presentation.
 
Altria reports its financial results, including diluted EPS, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Altria's management reviews operating companies income (OCI), which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Altria's management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items include restructuring charges, SABMiller special items, certain PMCC leveraged lease charges, certain tax items, and tobacco and health judgments. Altria's management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria's sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria's effective tax rate on operations may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. Altria's management believes that adjusted measures for OCI, operating margins and EPS, as well as the effective tax rate on operations, provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Altria's management uses adjusted measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of Altria's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, and should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are provided in the release. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
In the first quarter of 2012, Altria's net revenues were essentially unchanged at $5.6 billion primarily due to higher net revenues from financial services and wine, mostly offset by lower net revenues from smokeable products. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 1.3% to $4.0 billion.
Altria's 2012 first-quarter reported diluted EPS increased 6.7% primarily due to higher OCI from smokeable products and financial services, and fewer shares outstanding. These factors were partially offset by higher interest and other debt expense, net, and lower earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller. Altria's 2012 first-quarter adjusted diluted
 
EPS, which excludes special items that are discussed below, increased 11.4% to $0.49 as shown in Table 2 below.
Table 2 - Altria's Adjusted Results Excluding Special Items
 
SABMiller Special Items
Comparisons of Altria's first-quarter earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller were impacted by special items. SABMiller's 2012 first-quarter special items included costs for its "business capability programme," costs for SABMiller's acquisition of Foster's Group Limited and costs related to its transaction to promote sustainable economic and social development in South Africa, partially offset by a gain related to SABMiller's Australian joint venture. SABMiller's 2011 first-quarter special items included gains resulting from its hotel and gaming transaction, partially offset by costs for its "business capability programme." These special items after-tax are reflected in Schedule 4, "2012 SABMiller special items" and "2011 SABMiller special items," and the EPS impact of these special items is shown above in Table 2.
The smokeable products segment delivered solid 2012 first-quarter adjusted OCI and strong adjusted OCI margin growth through higher pricing and effective cost management. PM USA supported 's new brand architecture with brand-building initiatives behind Black, which helped drive 's solid first-quarter performance. Middleton reported strong machine-made large cigars volume and retail share growth.

The smokeable products segment's 2012 first-quarter net revenues decreased 0.8% primarily due to lower reported shipment volume and higher promotional investments to support 's growth, partially offset by higher list prices. Revenues net of excise taxes were essentially unchanged at $3.5 billion. For the first quarter of 2012, reported OCI for the smokeable products segment increased 5.1% to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher list prices and effective cost management, partially offset by lower reported shipment volume and higher promotional investments. Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding the special items identified in Table 3 below, increased 3.9% for the first quarter of 2012.

PM USA's reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for the first quarter of 2012 decreased 2.6% primarily due to trade inventory dynamics, partially offset by retail share gains and one additional shipping day. Trade inventories were lower in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first and fourth quarters of 2011. After adjusting for changes in trade inventories and one additional shipping day, PM USA's 2012 first-quarter domestic cigarettes shipment volume was estimated to be essentially unchanged versus the first quarter of 2011. Total cigarette category volume was estimated to be down approximately 2.5% for the first quarter, when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and one additional shipping day. PM USA's cigarettes volume performance is summarized in Table 4 and Schedule 6.
Middleton's 2012 first-quarter reported cigars shipment volume increased 14.3% primarily due to retail share gains, changes in wholesale trade inventories and one additional shipping day. Middleton's volume performance for machine-made large cigars is summarized in Table 4 and Schedule 6.

Note: Cigarettes volume includes units sold as well as promotional units, but excludes Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, Overseas Military, and Philip Morris Duty Free Inc.
In the cigarette category,'s 2012 first-quarter retail share performance benefited from the launch of Black. 's 2012 first-quarter retail share increased 0.1 share point versus the prior-year period to 42.3%. On a sequential basis, 's 2012 first-quarter retail share grew 0.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2011. PM USA believes that some of Black's 2012 retail share gains were driven by trial generating activities that are likely to moderate in 2013.

Note: Cigarettes retail share results are based on data from SymphonyIRI Group/Capstone, which is a retail tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share performance in retail stores selling cigarettes. The panel was not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the Internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets. Retail share results for cigars are based on data from the SymphonyIRI Group (SymphonyIRI) InfoScan Cigar Database for Food, Drug, Mass Merchandisers (excluding Wal-Mart) and Convenience trade classes, which tracks machine-made large cigars market share performance. Middleton defines machine-made large cigars as cigars made by machine that weigh greater than three pounds per thousand, except cigars sold at retail in packages of 20 cigars. This service was developed to provide a representation of retail business performance in key trade channels. It is SymphonyIRI's standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan syndicated services, which could restate retail share results that were released previously.

The smokeless products segment's 2012 first-quarter net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes were essentially unchanged primarily due to higher pricing, offset by lower reported volume. The smokeless products segment's 2012 first-quarter reported OCI decreased 0.5% primarily due to higher restructuring charges related to the cost reduction program announced in October 2011 and lower volume, mostly offset by higher pricing and lower costs. Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding the special items identified in Table 6
 
below, increased 8.8% for the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted OCI margins increased 4.8 percentage points to 59.8% for the first quarter. Revenues and OCI for the smokeless products segment are summarized in Table 6 below.

USSTC and PM USA's 2012 first-quarter combined reported domestic smokeless products shipment volume decreased 7.5% primarily due to changes in trade inventories and the timing of new products. 's 2012 first-quarter volume grew 5.5% as the brand continued to benefit from momentum from products introduced in recent years. 's 2012 first-quarter volume declined 15.0% due to the timing of new product introductions, which included the national launch of X-TRA and Snus in the first quarter of 2011, as well as the impact of seven SKUs that were de-listed in the second quarter of 2011. Other portfolio brands' volume declined 26.2% primarily due to Snus, which had lower levels of promotional support and was also impacted by the mix shift to tins with fifteen pouches.

While adjusted smokeless products volume is difficult to estimate on a quarterly basis, USSTC and PM USA believe that their combined 2012 first-quarter adjusted domestic smokeless products shipment volume grew ahead of recent category volume trends due to strong 2012 first-quarter retail share gains. USSTC and PM USA believe that the smokeless category's volume grew at an estimated rate of approximately 5% over the twelve months ending March 31, 2012. USSTC and PM USA's combined volume performance for smokeless products is summarized in Table 7 below.

New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing moist smokeless tobacco (MST) products on a can for can basis. To calculate volumes of cans and packs shipped, USSTC and PM USA have assumed that one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is equivalent to one can of MST.
USSTC and PM USA's 2012 first-quarter combined retail share increased 1.0 share point as 's share gains were partially offset by share losses on Other portfolio brands, and . and 's 2012 first-quarter combined retail share increased 2.3 share points.

Ste. Michelle delivered strong 2012 first-quarter revenue and volume results as it continued to focus on improving its premium product mix.
The wine segment's 2012 first-quarter net revenues and revenues net of excise taxes increased primarily due to higher premium volume. 2012 first-quarter net revenues increased 11.9% and revenues net of excise taxes grew 12.4%. The wine segment's 2012 first-quarter reported OCI increased 25.0% due to lower restructuring charges. Adjusted OCI, which is calculated excluding the special items identified in Table 9 below, was unchanged for the first quarter of 2012 as higher volume was offset primarily by higher costs for select vintages and costs related to an expansion of the sales force. Adjusted OCI margins decreased 1.7 percentage points to 13.8% for the first quarter of 2012. Revenues and OCI for the wine segment are summarized in Table 9 below.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release are described in Altria's publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
These factors include the following: Altria's tobacco businesses (PM USA, USSTC and Middleton) are subject to significant competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and cost; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; reliance on critical information systems, many of which are managed by third party services providers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; legislation, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases

Furthermore, the results of Altria's tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop new products and markets within and potentially outside the United States; to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to federal, state and local government regulation, including broad-based regulation of PM USA and USSTC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies' understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.
Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make except as required by applicable law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
