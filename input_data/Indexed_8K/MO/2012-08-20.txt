Other Events.
Preliminary Tender Offer Results
On August 20, 2012, Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) issued a press release announcing the preliminary results, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2012 (the Early Tender Deadline), for its previously announced cash tender offer (the Tender Offer) for up to $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes identified in the press release (the Notes). The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference to this Item 8.01.
Pricing of Tender Offer
On August 20, 2012, Altria issued a press release announcing the reference yields, total consideration and tender offer consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference to this Item 8.01, except for the section entitled 2012 Full-Year EPS Guidance.
This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of offers to buy any securities. The Tender Offer is being made only pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal. The Tender Offer is not being made to holders of Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction.
2012 Full-Year EPS Guidance
Altria has revised its estimate of the previously announced one-time pre-tax charge against 2012 third-quarter reported earnings, reflecting the estimated loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the Tender Offer (the Estimated Charge). Based on the total consideration for the Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer and the amount of Notes validly tendered by the Early Tender Deadline, Altria now expects the Estimated Charge to be approximately $875 million, or $0.28 per share. The final charge may vary to the extent that the amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date differs from the amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline.
Altria has revised its 2012 full-year guidance for reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) from a range of $1.96 to $2.00 to a range of $2.01 to $2.05, reflecting the Estimated Charge. The revised forecast reflects estimated total net expenses of $0.18 per share, as detailed in the table below, as compared with 2011 full-year reported diluted EPS of $1.64, which included $0.41 per share of net expenses, as detailed in the table below. Expected 2012 full-year adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the net expenses in the table below, represents a growth rate of 7% to 9% over 2011 full-year adjusted diluted EPS.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of the press release attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K represent continuing risks to this forecast.
2
Adjusted diluted EPS is a financial measure that is not consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Altria's management reviews diluted EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items include loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, SABMiller plc (SABMiller) special items, certain Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) leveraged lease items, certain tax items, and tobacco and health judgments. Altria's management does not view any of these special items to be part of its sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management believes it is appropriate to disclose this non-GAAP financial measure to provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and to provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Adjusted measures are used by management and regularly provided to Altria's chief operating decision maker for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of Altria's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

ALTRIA ANNOUNCES EARLY TENDER RESULTS OF DEBT TENDER OFFER
RICHMOND, Va. - August 20, 2012 - Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced the preliminary results for its previously announced cash tender offer for up to $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount (the "Tender Cap") of its senior unsecured notes identified in the table below (the Notes). The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated August 6, 2012, and the related Letter of Transmittal.
According to information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the Depositary and Information Agent for the tender offer, $1,734,101,000 aggregate principal amount of the 9.700% Notes due 2018, $1,282,485,000 aggregate principal amount of the 9.250% Notes due 2019, $283,917,000 aggregate principal amount of the 9.950% Notes due 2038 and $404,998,000 aggregate principal amount of the 10.200% Notes due 2039 were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2012 (the Early Tender Deadline). Tendered Notes may not be withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline.
The total aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline was $3,705,501,000, which amount exceeds the Tender Cap. Since Altria will accept for payment only such portion of the tendered Notes that does not result in it purchasing Notes with an aggregate principal amount above the Tender Cap, Altria will purchase a portion of the validly tendered Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 1 and will not purchase any Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 2, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Assuming that the conditions to the tender offer are satisfied or waived, tendered Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 1 will be accepted for purchase on a prorated basis as described in the Offer to Purchase, such that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes accepted in the tender offer equals the Tender Cap.
The tender offer for the Notes will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, August 31, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated by Altria.
6601 West Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23230
*Applies to the aggregate principal amount of Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 2.
**Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase.
For Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender
Deadline and accepted for purchase, the applicable total consideration per $1,000 principal amount of each series of Notes (for each series, the Total Consideration) will be a price determined as described in the Offer to Purchase intended to result in a yield to maturity (calculated in accordance with standard market practice) equal to the sum of (i) the yield to maturity for the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above, calculated based on the bid-side price of such U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, today, August 20, 2012 (being the first business day following the Early Tender Deadline), plus (ii) the applicable Fixed Spread specified in the table above. The Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment specified in the table above. Holders tendering their Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive only the applicable tender offer consideration, namely the applicable Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment specified in the table above.
In addition, holders whose Notes are purchased in the tender offer will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the payment date for such purchased Notes.

Exhibit 99.2
ALTRIA ANNOUNCES CONSIDERATION FOR DEBT TENDER OFFER
RICHMOND, Va. - August 20, 2012 - Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced the reference yields, total consideration and tender offer consideration for its previously announced cash tender offer for up to $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount (the Tender Cap) of its senior unsecured notes identified in the table below (the Notes). The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated August 6, 2012, and the related Letter of Transmittal.

In addition, holders whose Notes are purchased in the tender offer will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the payment date for such purchased Notes. The payment for Notes accepted for purchase is expected to occur on the first business day after the Expiration Date. Assuming that the tender offer expires on August 31, 2012, and the conditions to the tender offer are satisfied or waived, Altria expects the payment for the purchased Notes to be made on September 4, 2012.
Earlier today, Altria announced that the total aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline was $3,705,501,000, which amount exceeds the Tender Cap. Since Altria will accept for payment only such portion of the tendered Notes that does not result in it purchasing Notes with an aggregate principal amount above the Tender Cap, Altria will purchase a portion of the validly tendered 9.700% Notes due 2018 and 9.250% Notes due 2019 and will not purchase any 9.950% Notes due 2038 or 10.200% Notes due 2039, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Assuming that the conditions to the tender offer are satisfied or waived, tendered 9.700% Notes due 2018 and 9.250% Notes due 2019 will be accepted for purchase on a prorated basis as described in the Offer to Purchase, such that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes accepted in the tender offer equals the Tender Cap. Altria has directed Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary for the tender offer, to promptly return to holders all 9.950% Notes due 2038 and 10.200% Notes due 2039 that were tendered. All 9.700% Notes due 2018 and 9.250% Notes due 2019 tendered and not accepted for purchase will be returned to holders following the Expiration Date in accordance with the terms of the tender offer.
The tender offer for the Notes will expire on the Expiration Date, unless extended or earlier terminated by Altria.

The tender offer is not being made to holders of Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. None of Altria, the Dealer Managers, the Depositary, the Information Agent, or the trustee for the Notes makes any recommendation in connection with the tender offer.

2012 Full-Year EPS Guidance
Based on the Total Consideration described above and the amount of Notes validly tendered by the Early Tender Deadline, Altria is revising its estimate of the previously announced one-time pre-tax charge against 2012 third-quarter reported earnings, reflecting the estimated loss on early extinguishment of debt related to this debt tender offer (the Estimated Charge). Altria now expects the Estimated Charge to be approximately $875 million, or $0.28 per share. The final charge may vary to the extent that the amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date differs from the amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline.
Altria revises its 2012 full-year guidance for reported diluted EPS from a range of $1.96 to $2.00 to a range of $2.01 to $2.05, reflecting the Estimated Charge. The revised forecast reflects estimated total net expenses of $0.18 per share, consisting of the Estimated Charge and asset impairment, exit and implementation costs related to the current cost reduction program, partially offset by SABMiller plc (SABMiller) special items and a Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) leveraged lease benefit.
Altria reaffirms its 2012 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes special items shown in Table 1 below, to be in the range of $2.19 to $2.23, representing a growth rate of 7% to 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.05 per share in 2011.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to this forecast. Reconciliations of full-year adjusted to reported diluted EPS are shown in Table 1 below.
* Excludes the tax impact of the PMCC leveraged lease (benefit) charge.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release are described in Altria's publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012.
These factors include the following: Altria's tobacco businesses (PM USA, USSTC and Middleton) being subject to significant competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and cost; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; reliance on critical information systems, many of which are managed by third party service providers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; legislation, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases and concluded tobacco litigation settlements on trade inventories, consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and, from time to time, governmental investigations.
Furthermore, the results of Altria's tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop new products and markets within and potentially outside the United States; to broaden brand
4
portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to federal, state and local government regulation, including broad-based regulation of PM USA and USSTC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies' understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.
Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make except as required by applicable law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
