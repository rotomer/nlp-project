ALTRIA ANNOUNCES EXPIRATION OF DEBT TENDER OFFER AND FINAL RESULTS
RICHMOND, Va. - September 4, 2012 - Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced the expiration of and final results for its previously announced cash tender offer for up to $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount (the Tender Cap) of certain of its senior unsecured notes (the Notes). The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated August 6, 2012, and the related Letter of Transmittal.
The tender offer for the Notes expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, August 31, 2012 (the Expiration Date).
The total aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date and not validly withdrawn was $3,735,444,000, which exceeds the Tender Cap.  In accordance with the terms of the tender offer set forth in the Offer to Purchase, Altria accepted for purchase a portion of the validly tendered 9.700% Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and 9.250% Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Tender Cap.  Altria did not accept for purchase any 9.950% Notes due 2038 (the 2038 Notes) or 10.200% Notes due 2039 (the 2039 Notes).
According to information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the Depositary and Information Agent for the tender offer, $1,738,893,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes and $1,285,087,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes were validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date and not validly withdrawn. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, Notes have been accepted for purchase by the Company on a prorated basis using a single proration factor applicable equally to both series of Notes
.
As a result, the Company has accepted for purchase Notes using a proration factor of approximately 0.66, resulting in the purchase of approximately $1,150 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes and approximately $850 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes. All 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes that were not accepted for purchase will be returned to holders in accordance with the Offer to Purchase. The 2038 Notes and 2039 Notes that were tendered will be returned to the holders in accordance with the Offer to Purchase.

*Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase.
**Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes.
For the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase, the applicable total consideration per $1,000 principal amount of each series of Notes (for each series, the Total Consideration) is as specified in the table above. The Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment. Holders of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase will receive only the applicable Tender Offer Consideration, namely the applicable Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment.
In addition, holders whose Notes are purchased in the tender offer will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the payment date for such purchased Notes.
