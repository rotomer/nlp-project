Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Altria Group, Inc.s wholly-owned subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc. (PM USA), is a party to the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (the MSA) among various states and territories (the MSA States) and a number of tobacco product manufacturers (the participating manufacturers). PM USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) and Lorillard Tobacco Company (Lorillard) are collectively referred to as the original participating manufacturers (the OPMs). The MSA settled various asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery claims and requires PM USA and the other participating manufacturers to make significant annual payments. The MSA provides for downward adjustments to the participating manufacturers payment obligations under certain conditions, including a provision related to the loss of market share by the participating manufacturers, collectively, to the manufacturers who are not party to the MSA (the Non-Participating Manufacturers). This provision, known as the Non-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment (the NPM Adjustment), allocates a greater share of any such downward adjustment to any OPM that lost relative market share during the relevant period. For a more detailed description of the MSA and the NPM Adjustment, see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Altria Group, Inc. for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. The MSA States and the OPMs and certain other participating manufacturers are currently in arbitration regarding the NPM Adjustment for the year 2003.
Subject to certain conditions, PM USA, the other OPMs and certain other participating manufacturers have entered into a Term Sheet, effective December 17, 2012, with 17 MSA States, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, for settlement of the 2003-12 NPM Adjustments with those States (the signatory States). PM USA continues to reserve all rights regarding the NPM Adjustments with respect to the MSA States that have not joined the Term Sheet. It is possible that additional MSA States will subsequently join the Term Sheet.
The signatory States and the OPMs have agreed that the OPMs will receive reductions to future MSA payments to reflect a percentage of the signatory States aggregate share of the OPMs aggregate 2003-2012 NPM Adjustments. The amount of such percentage is dependent on the number of MSA States that join the Term Sheet. The OPMs have agreed that, subject to certain conditions, PM USA will receive approximately 28% of such reduction (which is the maximum allocation of the total 2003-2012 NPM Adjustments to which PM USA was entitled under the MSA); RJR will receive approximately 60% of such reduction; and Lorillard will receive approximately 12% of such reduction. The amount of PM USAs reduction cannot yet be determined but, based on the current signatory States, PM USA would receive an estimated reduction in its MSA payment obligation of approximately $450 million. This estimated amount is subject to change depending on a variety of factors related to the calculation of the reduction. Upon final determination of the amount and approval of the arbitration panel, as described below, PM USA is expected to record a corresponding increase in its reported pre-tax earnings.
Subject to certain conditions, PM USA will receive all of its reduction through a credit against its April 2013 MSA payment. RJR and Lorillard will receive part of their reduction through credits against their April 2013 payments and part through reductions in their MSA payments in April 2014-April 2017.
As part of the settlement, each of the signatory States will receive its portion of over $4 billion from the so-called Disputed Payment Account (the DPA). In this context, PM USA will authorize release to the signatory States of their share of the $458 million that PM USA has paid into the DPA, approximately $190 million.
The Term Sheet also provides that the NPM Adjustment provision will be revised and streamlined as to the signatory States for years after 2012. In connection with the settlement, the formula for allocating among the OPMs the revised NPM Adjustments applicable in the future to the signatory States will be
2
modified in a manner favorable to PM USA, although the extent to which it is favorable to PM USA will be dependent upon certain future events, including the future relative market shares of the OPMs.
The Term Sheet is subject to approval by the panel in the pending NPM Adjustment arbitration. It is possible that non-signatory States will attempt to object to approval of the Term Sheet or otherwise attempt to block it from proceeding. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of any such attempt.
The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Term Sheet, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 10.1
TERM SHEET
Accrued claims relating to the NPM Adjustment disputes for 2003 to 2011 and the 2012 NPM Adjustment would be handled as follows:
Appendix A sets forth the reference date for determining the aggregate Allocable Share and the increased settlement value applicable to States that sign this Term Sheet after December 14, 2012 (or, in the case of States with December hearing dates, after the start of their hearing).
1
________________________
1
SET includes state cigarette excise tax or other state tax on the distribution or sale of cigarettes (other than a state or local sales tax that is applicable to consumer products generally and is not in lieu of an excise tax), and, for NPM cigarettes sold after 2014, an excise or other tax imposed by a state- or federally-recognized tribe on the distribution or sale of cigarettes. Except if otherwise indicated, references to NPM sales, NPM cigarettes and NPM volume in this Term Sheet refer to NPM Cigarettes, with the term Cigarette having the meaning given in the MSA.
2
state, so long as such state did not release or refund any part of the deposit so recovered, unless released pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Statute, as amended by Allocable Share Repeal;

Subject to any limitation arising from Rule 11 or similar state ethical rules.
3
requirements, and (vi) the State has amended its Escrow Statute to remove the NPM's right to reversion and interest as to (but only as to) the escrow to be released in conformity with the above requirements.
3
Provided, however, that (i) a signatory Settling State may not release more than $1 million in escrow as described in this paragraph in any year to all tribes collectively; and (ii) in the event a court strikes down a signatory Settling State's removal of the NPMs' right to reversion and interest described in (vi) above, such State may pay to tribes the amounts authorized under the remainder of this paragraph out of its general fund (subject to all other conditions and limits set forth above). A State that releases escrow as described in this paragraph has the responsibility of ensuring that (i)-(vi) and the terms of the preceding sentence are met.
  
 
______________________________
3
This paragraph applies only with respect to cigarettes of NPMs that existed in the U.S. market as of June 1, 2012 and does not apply with respect to cigarettes of NPMs that entered the U.S. market after that date. In addition, this paragraph does not apply where any NPM involved in the production, distribution or sale of the cigarettes at issue is one (or an affiliate or successor of one) affiliated with the tribe (or any members of the tribe) to which the escrow would be released. For purposes of this paragraph, a tribe with reservation land located in more than one State is considered to have a reservation in, and to be eligible for release of escrow from, only the State in which the largest portion of its reservation land is located.

_______________________
4
The total SET-paid NPM volume in the MSA States will be calculated as follows. SET-paid NPM volume in a signatory Settling State will be the number of SET-paid NPM sales in that State in that year as determined through the process described in Section III.B.5. SET-paid NPM volume in a non-signatory Settling State will be NPM sales in that State in that year on which the State's cigarette excise tax was paid (or on which another state tax on the distribution or sale of cigarettes or an excise or other tax imposed by a tribe was paid if that State in that year treated NPM sales on which such tax was paid as fully subject to the escrow requirement under that State's Escrow Statute). For a non-signatory Settling State, such volume will be as reported by that State under the Significant Factor procedures agreement (or other agreement among the parties as to the Significant Factor issue for that year), provided that any signatory PM or signatory Settling State may challenge that reported volume in the arbitration referenced in Sections III.C.4 and IV.J.1 as an inaccurate measure of the volume described in the preceding sentence. In the event of such a challenge, the arbitration panel's determination of the volume will be final and binding on all signatory PMs and signatory Settling States. References to FET include arbitrios de cigarillos in Puerto Rico.
5
The final settlement agreement will include provisions addressing how the information for calculating the total equity-fee-paid NPM sales in each such PSS will be obtained. The current fee laws in MS and MN will be deemed to meet the requirements of clause (x) even though they otherwise would not so long as the per pack amount in effect under them remains at least as large as it is now. The signatory PMs further agree to the following: (i) the signatory OPMs agree to support the enactment in FL and TX of legislation meeting the requirements of clause (x) provided that such legislation is not in conjunction with any other legislative proposal and does not contain any provision that applies to the OPMs or their products or businesses; (ii) if the PSS amendment has become effective, the signatory SPMs agree not to oppose the enactment in FL and TX of legislation meeting the requirements of clause (x) provided that such legislation is not in conjunction with any other legislative proposal; and (iii) if a signatory PM supports the enactment in FL or TX of an equity fee law that does not meet the requirements of clause (x) and such law is enacted, the law will be deemed to meet the requirements of clause (x) as to that signatory PM (and, if enactment of the law was supported by signatory PMs with more than 60% Market Share, the law will be deemed to meet the requirements of clause (x) as to all signatory PMs).
5
such sales made via the Internet, (ii) all such tribal sales or sales on tribal lands, and (iii) all such sales that may otherwise constitute contraband.
 
6
______________________
6
The following are exempt from the Diligent Enforcement standard: (i) NPM cigarette sales on a federal installation in a transaction that is exempt from state taxation under federal law, and (ii) NPM cigarette sales on a tribe's reservation by an entity owned and operated by that tribe or member of that tribe to a consumer who is an adult member of that tribe in a transaction that is exempt from state taxation under federal law.
7
A finding referenced in (ii) will not increase the adjustment applicable to the State under Section III.B or the reduction under Section III.C.1(a)(i).
6
  
______________________
8
This Section does not affect the calculation of the amount of the NPM Adjustment under the MSA or this Term Sheet applicable to the signatory Settling States for any year in which NPM Market Share is greater than 3%.
7
Section B(ii) of Exhibit E arising from payments under Sections I-II being concentrated or recognized in less than 10 years.
  
8
will be relevant to the Diligent Enforcement determination.
9
In addition, if the difference between NPM and PM cigarettes with respect to taxes or stamping is material, the reduction in liability described in Section III.C.1(a)(i) will not be applied with respect to that State (if found non-exempt from the NPM Adjustment) for a year in which the difference is in effect.
______________________
9
This does not include (i) taxes or stamping requirements that differ for reservation sales and non-reservation sales provided that the taxes and stamping requirements applicable to reservation and non-reservation sales respectively are the same for both PM and NPM sales, or (ii) requirements that NPM cigarettes bear a stamp of a different color solely for purposes of identification.
9
Participating Manufacturers (including quarterly payments and de-listing); and (v) the NPM agrees that substantial non-compliance with its MSA obligations during the first five years after joining the MSA in the absence of a good-faith dispute would trigger the back-payment obligations that would otherwise have been required of it. The PMs do not waive rights under Section XVIII(b) of the MSA as to a new Participating Manufacturer's performance of its MSA obligations going forward. This section is conditioned upon the delivery to the PMs within 60 days of the execution of the final settlement agreement a binding agreement executed by all Settling States and the Foundation that NPMs that sign the MSA pursuant to this provision without making full back-payments will not be considered Participating Manufacturers for purposes of Section IX(e) of the MSA.
10
________________________
10
This provision does not apply to any entity that had previously agreed to sign the MSA and to make any back-payments. The PMs retain their rights under Section XVIII(b) of the MSA as to any such entity.
10
APPENDIX A:
Except as provided below, the initial sign-on date is December 14, 2012. For Settling States whose individual State diligent enforcement hearing in the 2003 Arbitration is scheduled to begin in December 2012 (WA, AZ and CO), the initial sign-on date is the day preceding the beginning of its hearing unless the beginning of its hearing is deferred until after December 14, 2012. At the present time, WA and AZ have agreed to such deferral, and their initial sign-on date will be December 14, 2012 so long as the Panel approves the deferral.
(B)
    
For Settling States that sign this Term Sheet (or, in the case of Settling States that do not sign this Term Sheet, the final settlement agreement) after the initial sign-on date, the applicable settlement value percentage is 59%. The signatory PMs, in their sole discretion, may waive all or part of the increase above the applicable settlement value percentage under subparagraph (A) as to such a State without triggering the MFN clause in this Term Sheet and without any obligation to provide a similar waiver to any other State.
12
(C)
    
The Reference Date is December 21, 2012. A Settling State that signs this
 
_________________________________________________
11
References to a State's Allocable Share percentage in this Term Sheet are to the percentage set forth for that State as listed in Exhibit A of the MSA.
12
Approval by signatory PMs representing at least 85% Market Share in 2011 will be sufficient for this waiver and will bind the remaining signatory PMs.
11
Term Sheet after the initial sign-on date but by the Reference Date will be counted as part of the aggregate Allocable Share under subparagraph (A) whether or not the signatory PMs waived the increased percentage applicable to such State under subparagraph (B).
(B)
    
The amount of the percentage in subparagraph (A)(ii) will be the percentage that, when applied to the OPMs' estimated MSA annual payments due in April 2014-2017 (the estimate being after the Inflation Adjustment, Volume Adjustment and Previously Settled States Reduction, but before the remaining adjustments, reductions and offsets under the MSA), yields a total reduction equal to 50% of the Total OPM Amount. (For example, if 50% of the Total OPM Amount were $1 billion and the OPMs' estimated MSA annual payments for 2014-2017 (as adjusted as specified above) were $5 billion per year, the percentage in subparagraph (A)(ii) would be 5%.) The percentage will be filled in with respect to the MSA annual payment due in April 2014 pursuant to these specifications as of the Reference Date (once the Total OPM Amount is known), subject to change in the event additional Settling States sign this Term Sheet or the final settlement agreement after the Reference Date. With respect to each of the reductions to the MSA annual payments due in April 2015-2017, the percentage will be recalculated annually on October 15 of the year prior to the year the payment is due (for example, on October 15, 2014 for the MSA annual payment due in April 2015) to reflect the percentage that, when applied to an estimate of the OPMs' next annual payment based upon inflation and volume in the first 9 months of the year prior to the year the payment is due, yields a reduction equal to 12.5% of the Total OPM Amount.
14
(C)
    
The final settlement agreement will include provisions that will apply in the event the Total OPM Amount increases after the Auditor's Final Calculation of the MSA annual payment due on April 15, 2013 as a result of increased State
 
____________________________________
13
Interest will only be paid on the portion of each reduction that exceeds 20% of the signatory Settling States' aggregate Allocable Share of amounts previously withheld by an OPM and paid into the DPA pursuant to Paragraph 5.
14
The reductions to be applied in 2014-2017 do not count in calculating the NPM Adjustment or toward the cap in Section IV.K (the final settlement agreement will include provisions addressing how the OPMs will receive the funds at issue if such a State does not have a sufficient MSA payment remaining in any such year to apply the reductions due that year). In addition, the final settlement agreement will include provisions regarding the accrual of the reductions.
12
participation after that date and that specify how the increased part of that Amount will be provided to the OPMs. Unless the parties agree otherwise, those provisions will be consistent with the principles of this Appendix, including providing for payment of 50% of the increased part of that Amount by first-available credit and of the remaining 50% by reduction.
(D)
    
Each credit and reduction will be allocated among the OPMs as directed by the OPMs.
______________________
15
Subject to the limits specified below, a signatory Settling State that signs this Term Sheet by the Reference Date may elect, by notice to the parties no later than the Reference Date, for its Share of the Total OPM Amount to be applied entirely as a credit against the OPMs' MSA annual payment due in April 2013. In that event, the overall amounts of the respective credit and reductions under Paragraph 3 will not change, but the credit and reductions will be allocated among the signatory Settling States differently so that (i) each electing State is allocated a portion of the April 2013 credit equal to its Share of the Total OPM Amount and is allocated none of the 2014-2017 reductions, and (ii) each other signatory Settling State is allocated a lower portion of the April 2013 credit and a corresponding higher portion of each of the 2014-2017 reductions as necessary to fulfill the provisions of Paragraph 4. Unless the OPMs agree otherwise, the election right will not be available if it would result in a profit adjustment under Section B(ii) of Exhibit E of the MSA or if it is not possible to apply the preceding sentence because too many signatory Settling States have already sought to make that election.
13
and solely among the signatory Settling States as described in Paragraph 4; and (ii) to allocate the amount released from the DPA under Paragraph 5 solely among the signatory Settling States in proportion to their respective Allocable Shares, except for those amounts allocated to the Data Clearinghouse.

Dear Counsel:
I am authorized by the Original Participating Manufacturers to agree: (1) pursuant to Section IV.E of the Term Sheet, that the PMs that have joined the November 14, 2012 Term Sheet to date constitute a critical mass of PMs and that the Settling States that have signed that Term Sheet to date, with an aggregate Allocable Share of approximately 42%, constitute a critical mass of Settling States; and (2) for purposes of Section I.A.2 of the Term Sheet and Appendix A, Paragraph 2(A) of the Term Sheet, joinder by those signatory Settling States with that aggregate Allocable Share qualifies as joinder by Settling States with an aggregate Allocable Share of 50% and gives rise to a Settlement Value Percentage of 46%.

Exhibit 99.1
Philip Morris USA Reaches Agreement with Nineteen States
to Resolve MSA Payment Adjustment Disputes
RICHMOND, Va. (December 18, 2012)
- Philip Morris USA Inc. (PM USA) and other cigarette manufacturers have reached an agreement with nineteen states to resolve long-standing disputes related to the Non-Participating Manufacturer (NPM) adjustment provisions of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA).
The jurisdictions that have agreed to join are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming (collectively, the states).
This agreement resolves disputes with a large group of states on financial terms that are fair to the parties and in a way that we believe will lead to a better method for resolving these issues in the future, said Denise Keane, Altria Group, Inc.s executive vice president and general counsel, speaking on behalf of PM USA. The agreement includes a mechanism that under certain conditions allows additional states to join, and we hope other states take advantage of that option.
The agreement includes a release to the joining states of their portion of more than $4 billion from disputed payment accounts. In return, the manufacturers will receive credits against the joining states' portion of future MSA payments. For the joining states, the settlement is net cash positive and also removes the risk of substantial reductions of MSA revenues for the years in dispute, 2003-2012.
Based on current assumptions, PM USA will receive approximately 28% of the credits to the companies that were original participants in the MSA. This percentage mirrors the maximum percentage of NPM adjustments that would be allocated to PM USA if the disputes were arbitrated to conclusion, as the MSA allocates a greater share of recovery to those original participating manufacturers that lost relative market share during the relevant period.
PM USAs credit is estimated to total approximately $450 million, based on the current roster of states. This estimate is subject to change depending on a variety of factors related to the calculation of the credit. The agreement is also subject to approval by an arbitration panel. Upon final determination of the amount and approval of the arbitration panel, PM USA is expected to record a corresponding increase in its reported pre-tax earnings.
The agreement also puts into place revised and streamlined NPM adjustments for future years.
The NPM adjustment disputes arose out of the MSA, which PM USA and the other leading cigarette manufacturers entered into with 46 states to resolve the states' health care cost recovery litigation against the manufacturers. The MSA imposed significant restrictions on how cigarettes are advertised, marketed and sold in the United States and required participating manufacturers to make annual payments to the states in perpetuity. So far, states participating in the MSA have received more than $85 billion.
The NPM adjustment disputes relate to the state escrow statutes, under which non-participating cigarette manufacturers are required to make escrow payments for volume sold in each MSA state. The MSA allows participating manufacturers to receive downward adjustments in MSA payments if the MSA is a significant factor in market share loss for the participating manufacturers. States that demonstrate that they diligently enforced state escrow statutes during a disputed year can avoid the downward payment adjustment for that year.
PM USA is prepared to continue the current arbitration with states that did not join the agreement.
A more detailed description of the agreement is included in Altria Group, Inc.s 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
