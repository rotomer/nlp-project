EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS 2004 FISCAL FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Lisle, IL, USA -- October 15, 2003 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. Fiscal 1st Quarter Results - --------------------------- Revenues of $496.8 million increased 6 percent from last year's first quarter of $469.2 million. Revenues in local currencies increased 4 percent, as currency translation increased net revenues by $10.3 million when compared with last year's first quarter. Net income was $32.1 million compared with last year's first quarter of $30.0 million, an increase of 7 percent. While currency translation had a positive effect on revenue, it had a negative impact on net income. Earnings per share were $0.17 compared with $0.15 reported for the first quarter a year ago. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenues exceeded our forecast and increased sequentially by 4 percent, a respectable result in this seasonally challenging quarter. Compared with last year's fiscal first quarter, revenues increased 6 percent, and although the revenue was helped by currency translation, we were pleased to see this growth and the improvement in earnings per share. The level of new orders during the quarter, especially in the month of September, was also very encouraging. "Looking at our regional results compared with last year's fiscal first quarter, in the Far East South region, revenues exceeded forecast and increased 25 percent in dollars, primarily driven by the digital consumer, PC, and mobile telephone markets. In this region, we are the largest supplier and continue to gain market share, based on our many new products and increased penetration of our global customers who continue to transfer production to the region. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenues increased by 14 percent in both dollars and local currencies, primarily driven by new products for the digital consumer market. In the Americas region, revenues were flat with last year. "In the European region, revenues in local currency declined 10 percent, reflecting Europe's recession and production transfers by our customers primarily to the Far East South. Revenues in dollars increased 4 percent, due to the gain in the Euro." Operating Results and Factors Impacting Profit Leverage - -------------------------------------------------------- King continued, "Gross profit margin increased slightly to 34.1 percent versus last year's first quarter, and sequentially from 33.7 percent when compared with the June quarter prior to the restructuring charge. We believe this to be a reasonable result, considering that our manufacturing plants continue to operate below optimum capacity utilization. Pretax return on sales was 8.9 percent, an increase of 11.3 percent compared with last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate was 27 percent compared with 24 percent in last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to a larger mix of pretax income being earned in higher tax locations. Net return on sales was 6.5 percent compared with 6.4 percent in last year's first quarter. Cash flow remains strong and our ending cash balance stood at $320.6 million." King continued, "We were pleased with our overall results and believe that global business conditions continue to improve. Although revenue and earnings per share were stronger than expected, several factors limited expansion of net return on sales for the quarter. They are: - The absence of profit leverage from the $10.3 million favorable currency translation benefit to revenue. Currency translation actually lowered net income by $0.3 million, due to the translation occurring primarily in the European region where current profitability is below average. - Costs for the transition of fiber optic manufacturing announced in the 2003 fiscal fourth quarter earnings release were somewhat higher than anticipated. - The substantial increase in demand in both Far East regions exceeded existing capacity in several new product areas. This resulted in higher manufacturing costs which should gradually decrease as planned capacity additions become available." The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2003 stood at $208.0 million, compared with $196.4 million a year ago and $185.6 million at fiscal year end 2003. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the backlog in this current quarter would have been $196.0 million - virtually flat with last year in local currencies. Bookings for the first quarter increased 9.8 percent sequentially from the June quarter, and 10.5 percent when compared with last year's first quarter. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ------------------------------------------------------------ Research and development expenditures for the first quarter were $26.9 million, compared with $30.1 million for the same period last year. This reduction was due to the adoption of a more narrow definition of research and development for FY04, resulting in a reclassification of expenditures to other expense categories, as well as lower expenditures due to exiting the active fiber business that the Company announced in the June 30, 2003 earnings release. Capital expenditures were $45.3 million for the quarter versus $38.1 million last year. Fiscal 2nd Quarter Outlook and Stock Buyback Actions - ------------------------------------------------------ King continued, "The overall level of new orders during the September quarter was encouraging, and we believe that a majority of our global markets are now in an initial phase of cautious expansion. Our operations in the Far East continue to drive our results. We believe that inventory in the majority of our worldwide sales channels remains below normal levels, and when combined with expanding demand should lead to continued improvement in our financial results." Based on these facts, the Company expects that revenues for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2003, will be in a range of $500 - $510 million. This represents an increase of 10 -12 percent over the second quarter last fiscal year. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.18 - $0.19, an increase of 20 - 26 percent over the second quarter last fiscal year. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 795,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $20 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004.
