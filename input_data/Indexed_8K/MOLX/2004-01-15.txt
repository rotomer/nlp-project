Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS STRONG 2004 FISCAL SECOND QUARTER RESULTS; EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 40%; REVENUE UP 20% Lisle, IL, USA - January 15, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003. Second Quarter and Six Month Results - ------------------------------------ Revenues of $548.9 million increased 20.8 percent from last year's second quarter of $454.6 million. Revenues in local currencies increased 14.6 percent, as currency translation increased net revenues by $28.0 million when compared with last year's second quarter. Net income was $41.2 million compared with last year's second quarter of $28.2 million, an increase of 46.3 percent. Currency translation increased net income by $1.0 million. Earnings per share of $0.21 increased 40.0 percent compared with $0.15 reported for the second quarter a year ago. Revenue in the Far East South increased 34 percent in dollars and 32 percent in local currency, primarily driven by the digital consumer, PC, and mobile phone markets. Revenue in the Far East North (Japan and Korea) increased by 30 percent in dollars and by 18 percent in local currencies. This growth was driven by our new products, especially for the digital, mobile and personal electronics markets including flat panel displays, DVD recorders, digital still cameras and mobile phones. Revenues were also strong in the industrial market, where the Company further expanded market share, especially for semiconductor inspection equipment. In the Americas, revenue increased 6 percent from last year, the strongest result in several years, based on a broad improvement in end markets. In Europe, revenue in local currency increased 3 percent while revenue in dollars increased 22 percent, helped by the strong Euro. Gross profit margin increased to 32.9 percent versus last year's second quarter margin of 32.2 percent. Pretax return on sales was 10.3 percent, versus last year's second quarter margin of 8.2 percent. The effective tax rate was 27.0 percent compared with 24.0 percent in last year's second quarter. This increase was primarily due to a larger mix of pretax income being earned in higher tax locations. Net return on sales was 7.5 percent compared with 6.2 percent in last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations remains strong and our quarter ending cash balance stood at $327.6 million. Several factors impacted results for the quarter: - "Other income" included a $5.0 million pretax gain on a stock sale and a $5.4 million pretax positive equity adjustment, both arising from an IPO completed by a company in which Molex retains a 20 percent ownership. These were partially offset by $5.0 million in negative adjustments to exit other investments. - There was a $3.4 million pretax negative impact to cost of sales due to additional tariff costs arising from prior years, plus the conversion in Japan to mandated lead-free plating, as well as severance costs resulting from the closure of manufacturing in Puerto Rico. - There was a $2.1 million pretax negative impact to selling and administrative expense arising from the disposal of certain assets, as well as a settlement with a customer. The Company's order backlog on December 31, 2003 stood at $226.6 million, a 30.5 percent increase compared with $173.7 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the current backlog would have been $212.6 million, an increase in local currency of 22.4 percent. Bookings for the second quarter increased 9.6 percent sequentially from the first quarter, and 28.2 percent compared with last year's second quarter. Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2003 were $1,045.7 million, compared with $923.8 million in the prior fiscal year period, a 13.2 percent increase. Net income of $73.3 million increased 26.0 percent when compared with last year's net income of $58.2 million. Earnings per share were $0.38, compared with $0.30 reported for the prior fiscal year. For the six-month period, currency translation increased net revenues by $38.4 million, but increased net income by only $0.7 million. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ---------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the second quarter were $27.5 million, compared with $29.2 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenditures for the six-month period were $54.3 million, versus $59.3 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $38.6 million, versus $41.6 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the six-month period were $83.9 million, versus $79.7 million for the same period last year. Fiscal 3rd Quarter Outlook and Stock Buyback Actions - ---------------------------------------------------- The level of new orders remains encouraging, especially in the Far East and the Americas. Although visibility remains difficult beyond the March quarter, we believe that a majority of our global markets continue to improve and that inventory in the majority of our worldwide sales channels remains below normal levels. The Company expects that revenues for the third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2004 will be in a range of $550 - $560 million. This represents an increase of 24 - 26 percent over the third quarter last fiscal year. The Company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.21 - $0.23, an increase of 60 - 75 percent over the third quarter last fiscal year. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 200,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $5.4 million. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, the Company has repurchased 995,000 shares for a total of $25.4 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Purchases for the December quarter were below previous quarters in anticipation of the closing of a previously announced acquisition. The Company will continue its quarterly stock buyback program for the remainder of FY04.
