EXHIBIT 99 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX MAKES STRONG START TO FISCAL 2005 YEAR; RECORD REVENUE ACHIEVED, UP 29 PERCENT; EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 71 PERCENT Lisle, IL, USA - October 20, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported record revenue results for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. Fiscal First Quarter Results Revenue of $640.2 million increased 29 percent from last year's first quarter of $496.8 million. Revenue in local currencies increased 25 percent, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $19 million when compared with last year's first quarter. Revenue for the first quarter included $18 million from the automotive acquisition in Europe that was completed on April 2, 2004. Excluding the acquisition, revenue increased 25 percent from last year's first quarter. Net income was $55.6 million compared with last year's first quarter of $32.1 million, an increase of 74 percent. Earnings per share of $0.29 increased 71 percent, compared with $0.17 reported for the first quarter a year ago. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenue growth compared with last year's first quarter revenue was very strong. Revenue also increased sequentially, an excellent result in this seasonally challenging quarter. We believe we are growing significantly faster than the overall connector market, primarily due to our ongoing investment in new products and our global capabilities. We were also pleased with the strong growth in earnings after absorbing higher costs for many of our raw materials." Regional Results Revenue in the Far East South region was $190 million, an increase of 33 percent, primarily driven by the digital consumer, PC, and mobile communication markets. In this region, we continue to gain market share, based on our many new products and increased penetration into our global customers who continue to transfer production to the region. Revenue in the Far East North region (Japan and Korea) was $132 million, an increase of 13 percent in dollars and 6 percent in local currencies. This growth was primarily due to new products for the digital consumer and communication markets. Revenue in the Americas region was $177 million, an increase of 17 percent, due to stronger demand for high-speed, industrial and medical electronics products, which more than offset lower demand in automotive. Revenue in Europe was $128 million, an increase of 73 percent in dollars and 61 percent in local currencies. Excluding the previously mentioned automotive acquisition, revenue increased 49 percent in dollars, as the region recovers from recession. Operating Results Gross profit margin was 35.7 percent compared with last year's first quarter margin of 33.8 percent. Pretax return on sales was 12 percent compared with 8.9 percent in the year ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27 percent, the same rate as last year's first quarter. The Company now anticipates an effective tax rate of 27 percent for the 2005 fiscal year, compared with previous guidance of 27.5 percent and a 2004 fiscal year rate of 26.5 percent. Net return on sales was 8.7 percent compared with 6.5 percent in last year's first quarter. Cash and marketable securities were $331.4 million at September 30, 2004. The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2004 stood at $313.6 million, a 51 percent increase compared with $208 million for the same period last year. Without the impact of changes in currency rates, the order backlog would have increased 48 percent. New orders for the first quarter were $622.4 million, an increase of 21 percent compared with last year's first quarter. This was a reasonable result, considering an estimated $25 million in orders were advanced by customers into the June quarter, as discussed in the June 30, 2004 earnings release. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending Research and development expenditures for the first quarter were $33.4 million, an increase of 24 percent when compared with the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $48.4 million for the quarter versus $45.3 million last year. Fiscal Second Quarter Outlook King continued, "Our operations in the Far East continue to drive our results. We expect this trend to continue, based on the magnitude of production transferred by our global customers to the region and supported by our technical capabilities and long term history of working in the region." "It is apparent that many of our customers in the Americas are in the process of adjusting their finished goods inventory to more conservative levels. However, we believe that the amount of actual connector inventory within these channels is reasonable, and therefore the outlook in the majority of our markets remains encouraging. In addition, we expect to gain market share based on our positions within key market segments - such as digital consumer, mobile communication and mobile computing - that are growing faster than the overall connector market, as well as our focus on the emerging medical electronics market." Based on these facts, the Company expects that revenue for the fiscal second quarter ending December 31, 2004, will be in a range of $635 - $650 million. This represents an increase of 16 - - 18 percent over last year's fiscal second quarter. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.29 - $0.31, an increase of 38 - 48 percent over last year's fiscal second quarter earnings per share. Stock Buyback Actions During the quarter, the Company purchased 875,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $21.9 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2005.
