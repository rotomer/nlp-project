As previously disclosed, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), Molex's former independent registered public accounting firm, resigned on November 13, 2004. During the two most recent fiscal years and through December 9, 2004, the Company has not consulted with E&Y regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided that E&Y concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a reportable event required to be reported under paragraph 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. In connection with the potential engagement of E&Y, Molex and E&Y discussed the nature of the matters described in Item 4.01 of Molex's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 18, 2004 and in the Amendment to such Form 8-K (including the letter of Deloitte filed as an exhibit thereto) filed with the Commission on December 1, 2004, including the reportable event disclosed therein and the matter that was the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with Deloitte. Molex has determined to adopt a number of measures designed to strengthen Molex's accounting and financial reporting infrastructure and processes, including Molex's intention to add a new director to the Board who would serve on the Audit Committee and qualify as a "financial expert," to hire a Chief Financial Officer to replace the Company's Acting Chief Financial Officer, who would continue to serve as an Executive Vice President and President, Far East South of Molex, and to conduct management and Audit Committee training on accounting, financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, Molex has taken other actions in connection with the transition to E&Y, including those described in the fifth paragraph under Item 5.02 herein. Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers. _________ _________________________________________________________ The Molex Board of Directors named Frederick A. Krehbiel, Co- Chairman of the Board of Directors, as Chief Executive Officer of Molex effective December 9, 2004.

The members of the Krehbiel Family may be considered "control persons" of Molex. Reference is made to Molex's proxy statement filed with the SEC on September 15, 2004 for information regarding Frederick A. Krehbiel's employment arrangements with Molex. Martin P.
