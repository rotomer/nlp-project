Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. __________ __________________________________________________ As part of its ongoing business practices, Molex evaluates its operations in accordance with business needs. On April 22, 2005, the Company adopted a plan to realign part of its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize its plant utilization and to reduce SG&A. As disclosed in the Company's April 25, 2005 press release, Molex expects to take an estimated pretax charge of $25 to $30 million in the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and an additional estimated pretax charge of $20 to $30 million during fiscal 2006. The expected pre-tax charge for the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter includes estimated cash expenditures of approximately $27 million, including estimated severance and other employee-related costs of approximately $19 million and estimated equipment relocation and other facility transition costs of approximately $8 million. The expected pre-tax charge for fiscal 2006 includes estimated cash expenditures of approximately $23 million, including estimated severance and other employee- related costs of approximately $13 million and estimated equipment relocation and other facility transition costs of approximately $10 million. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors including the Company's efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. The facility closures involve the Company's operations in the Americas and Europe Regions. In the Americas, the Company will close an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and cease manufacturing in its Detroit area automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in the Detroit area will continue in operation. Production from these facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, the Company will close manufacturing facilities in Ireland and Portugal, and reduce the size of a development center in Germany. Production from these manufacturing facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. Included in the charge is an amount to expense certain product related tooling in the Far East South and Europe Regions. Also included in the charge will be costs to reduce the Company's selling, general and administrative costs in the Americas, Europe, and at the corporate office. The Company estimates that it will reduce headcount by approximately 1,200 people partially offset by additions at the facilities where production is being transferred. Total savings from the restructuring have not yet been finalized; and the Company expects to provide additional information in the future. Statements in this Form 8-K that are not historical, including statements regarding the Company's cost reduction plans and the anticipated costs and timing of such plans, are forward-looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. These risks and uncertainties include the effectiveness, timing and cost of the Company's plant realignment efforts and other general economic and market factors. Other risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molex's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2004, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Molex disclaims any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
