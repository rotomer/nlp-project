The promotion of Liam McCarthy to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer of Molex effective July 1, 2005 and of Graham C.

In addition, in recognition of the increase in Mr. McCarthy's responsibilities, the Compensation Committee authorized the grant of a stock option with respect to 150,000 shares and a restricted stock award of 25,000 shares to Mr. McCarthy under The 2000 Molex Incorporated Long-Term Stock Plan.

On June 1, 2005, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved a form of Consultancy Agreement. The Consultancy Agreement, which is expected to be entered into on or before July 1, 2005, has a three year term and provides, among other things, for payments to the consulting firm with which Mr. Fichtner will be affiliated of EUR 214,260 (approximately $279,138 based on current exchange rates) for each of the first two years and of EUR 107,130 (approximately $139,569 based on current exchange rates) the last year. The agreement includes obligations of consulting services, confidentiality and a covenant not to compete against Molex in Europe for a period ending one year after the termination or expiration of the Consultancy Agreement.
