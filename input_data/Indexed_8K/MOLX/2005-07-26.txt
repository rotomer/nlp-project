EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX ANNOUNCES OUTLOOK FOR FULL YEAR FISCAL 2006 AND FIRST QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 Lisle, Ill., USA -- July 26, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today announced its outlook for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, and for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005. Outlook ------- Fiscal Year 2006 outlook ------------------------ The Company anticipates that its growth in fiscal 2006 will be led by the Far East North and Far East South regions, while business in the Americas and Europe is expected to increase modestly. The Company expects strong demand for digital consumer products, including high definition televisions and digital audio players, hand-held devices and data storage products. In the industrial and distribution markets the Company expects solid growth, but with below average growth rates expected in telecom infrastructure and automotive markets. The Company also expects to continue to increase sales in the medical and commercial military markets. Based on these conditions, the Company estimates that net revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 will be in a range of $2.675 billion to $2.750 billion. Based on these net revenue expectations, earnings per share including a pre-tax restructuring charge expected to be between $15.0 million and $25.0 million, are estimated to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.12. The reduction in earnings per share from this restructuring charge is estimated to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.09. Two items included in these estimates are expected to reduce fiscal 2006 earnings per share in total by approximately $0.08. These are: - Adoption of FASB 123(R) requiring the expensing of stock option costs. This non-cash accounting charge is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2006 earnings per share by approximately $0.05, and is expected to reduce first fiscal quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.01. - An increase in the effective tax rate to 28.5 percent, compared with 27.0 percent reported for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005, primarily due to anticipated changes in the mix of earnings by country. This is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2006 earnings per share by approximately $0.03, and is expected to reduce first fiscal quarter earnings per share by less than $0.01. Update on cost reduction plan and expected annual savings --------------------------------------------------------- The Company has made substantial progress in its plan to realign part of its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize its plant utilization. At the time the cost reduction plan was announced in April 2005, the Company expected a pre-tax charge for restructuring in the range of $25 million to $30 million for fiscal 2005 and $20 million to $30 million for fiscal 2006. The Company now anticipates that the fiscal 2005 pre-tax charge will be in the range of $30 million to $35 million and that the fiscal 2006 charge will be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions are dependent upon a number of factors, including the Company's efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. Though it is difficult to precisely forecast the timing of the plant closures and the amount of realizable cost savings, the Company expects that the pre-tax savings from the restructuring activities will be in the range of $10 million to $15 million for fiscal 2006. These savings are expected to be heavily weighted toward the end of the fiscal year, by which time the plant relocations are expected to be substantially completed. The full-year pre-tax impact for fiscal 2007 of these expected savings is estimated to be in the range of $32 million to $40 million. FY06 capital spending and research and development -------------------------------------------------- The Company estimates capital spending in fiscal 2006 to be in a range of $220 million to $240 million, primarily for investment in revenue producing assets, and for expanding our manufacturing in lower cost locations. The Company estimates spending for research and development in fiscal 2006 to be in a range of $145 million to $155 million. Fiscal first quarter outlook ---------------------------- For the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005, the Company estimates that net revenue will be in a range of $640 million to $660 million. Based on these net revenue expectations, earnings per share including a pre-tax restructuring charge expected to be between $4 million to $6 million, are estimated to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23. The reduction in earnings per share from this restructuring charge is estimated to be in a range of $0.01 to $0.03. Martin Slark, Chief Executive Officer, concluded, "Molex is well positioned for profitable growth from an increasing number of global market opportunities. As one of the first in the industry to manufacture in the Far East, we have important customer relationships and significant technical resources. Molex currently has six factories in China and expects to soon begin construction of a seventh. During fiscal 2006 we intend to continue the process of transitioning to a lower cost basis." Future corporate activities --------------------------- Molex has scheduled a conference call to discuss the above topics for 4:00 p.m. CDT on Tuesday, July 26, and is available live and in replay to all investors through the Internet by accessing the "Investors" section of the Company's website at www.molex.com.
