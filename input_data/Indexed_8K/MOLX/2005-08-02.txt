The Compensation Committee reviewed and determined fiscal 2006 salary levels for the officers listed on Exhibit 99.1 hereto. Such salary determinations, along with the effective dates thereof, are set forth in the schedule attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. (b) Reviewed and approved Cash Merit Bonus Plan for Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the fiscal year 2006 cash merit bonus plan. This plan provides that cash bonuses will be paid to executive officers based on the achievement of certain profit before tax and individual performance objectives. The cash bonus opportunity for executive officers under such plan ranges from 0% to 150% of base salary. Payments to executive officers under the plan may be more or less than a target bonus as a function of the Company's results or individual performance. The cash bonus opportunity is 30% of base salary based on achievement of minimum performance goals, 60% of base salary based on achievement of target performance goals and 150% of base salary based on achievement of maximum performance goals. If minimum performance goals are not achieved, no bonus is payable under this plan. In addition, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may downwardly adjust the potential bonus award to a lesser percentage, including 0%, to take into consideration unusual events. An overview of the cash merit bonus plan is attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. (c) Reviewed and approved a revision to retirement arrangement with Goro Tokuyama. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved a revision to the previously disclosed retirement arrangement with Goro Tokuyama, Regional President of Molex's Far East North Region. The revisions reflect Mr. Tokuyama's previously announced resignation as an executive officer of the Company and take into account changes in Mr. Tokuyama's compensation due to a merit pay increase. An overview of the revised arrangement is attached as Exhibit 99.3 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. On July 28, 2005, the Molex Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, took the following actions regarding supplemental executive retirement benefits. Molex maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") that provides senior executives, including executive officers, with certain benefits upon retirement. All amounts payable under the SERP are payable in cash. In response to federal income tax law changes governing non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, the Board approved freezing Molex's existing SERP in order to ensure that SERP benefits that are not subject to the new tax law continue to be provided under the terms of the SERP, without adverse tax consequences for the participants. At the same time, the Board approved a new Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that provides for supplemental retirement benefits that are subject to the new tax law, on terms and conditions intended to comply with the new tax law. A copy of such Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan is attached as Exhibit 99.4 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. On July 28, 2005, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, met and approved the adoption of the 2005 Molex Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which non-employee directors of the Company may defer their compensation for board service. The Plan provides that any non-employee director may elect to defer all or a portion of his or her director fees, including annual retainer, board meeting fees, and board committee meeting fees, paid by the Company to a deferred compensation account. A participant may elect to have the amount deferred (1) accrue interest during each calendar quarter at a rate equal to the six month Treasury Bill rate in effect at the beginning of each calendar quarter, or (2) credited as stock "units" whereby each unit is equal to one share of Molex common stock. If the participant elects to receive a stock-based rate of return, the number of deferred stock units credited to a participating director's account equals the amount of the deferred cash compensation divided by the fair market value of Molex common stock on the date the deferred fees would otherwise be paid. Dividend equivalents are earned on deferred stock units based upon the fair market value of a share of Molex Common Stock on the dividend payment date. At the time of distribution, any stock units are converted into cash by multiplying the number of units by the fair market value of the stock as of the payment date. The Plan provides that distribution of the aggregate value of the participant's account is to commence within 30 days of the earliest of the following events: (1) termination of service with Molex after age 59 1/2; or (2) age 59 1/2 if termination with Molex occurs before age 59 1/2; or (3) disability; or (4) death; or (5) an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in the Plan). The cumulative amount that is deferred for each participating director is subject to the claims of the general creditors of Molex. A copy of the Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan is attached as Exhibit 99.5 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such Plan. Item 8.01 Other Events. _________ ______________ On July 28, 2005, Molex issued a press release announcing an increase in the Company's cash dividend. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.6 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. Molex also announced that its Board of Directors has set the time and date for its 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on October 28, 2005. The record date for determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting was set as the close of business on September 2, 2005.

Upon a Participant's death, the Committee shall pay to the Participant's Beneficiary a benefit equal to the remaining balance in the Participant's Account in a single lump sum payment. Payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the Participant's death. 6.6 Payment Forms. (a) Unless a Participant otherwise elects in accordance with paragraph (b) below, a Participant's Account shall be paid in a single lump sum. (b) In lieu of a lump sum form of payment, a Participant may elect to receive distribution of any Deferred Amount in the form of substantially equal annual installment payments. A Participant may select the number of years over which the aggregate amount of any Deferred Amount is to be paid, up to a maximum of five years. Such election shall be made in the form required by the Committee and shall be filed with the Committee with each Deferral Form. During the payout period, earnings shall accrue on a Participant's Account in the manner provided in Section 7.3. The amount of each installment payment shall be equal to the balance remaining in the Participant's Account immediately prior to each such payment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of installment payments remaining, with the last installment consisting of the balance of the Participant's vested Account, as liquidated to close the Account. A Participant may change his or her benefit payment election only as described in Section 6.7. If no valid installment payment election is in effect when distribution is to be made, then payment of the Participant's Account shall be made in a single lump sum. 6.7 Changes to Time and Form of Payment. (a) A Participant may extend an existing Early Benefit Distribution election for any Expatriate Deferral and/or Participant Deferral under the Plan, provided the distribution shall be deferred to a date that is at least five years after the date the distribution would otherwise have commenced. (b) A Participant who has elected a lump sum distribution may later change such election to installment payments, selecting a payment period from one to five years, provided the first installment payment shall be deferred to a date that is at least five years after the date the lump sum distribution would otherwise have been made. (c) A Participant who has an installment payment election in effect may change such election so as to delay the start of the installment period (or extend the installment period to a maximum of five years), provided the first installment payment shall be deferred to a date that is at least five years after the date the initial installment payment would otherwise have commenced. A Participant, however, shall not be permitted to change an installment election to a lump sum payment. (d) Any such election changes shall be completed in accordance with Committee rules, and shall not be effective unless made more than twelve (12) months before the date payment would otherwise be made or begin to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, election changes that have the effect of accelerating the time for payment shall be prohibited. 6.8 Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant may request that all or a portion of his or her Account balance be distributed at any time by submitting a written request to the Committee demonstrating that he or she has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, and that the distribution is necessary to alleviate the financial hardship created by the Unforeseeable Emergency. The Committee shall have the sole discretionary authority to determine whether a Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency. Upon the finding that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee shall distribute to the Participant in a lump sum that portion of his or her Account necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency, plus taxes attributable thereto, provided that the Committee has taken into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, or by liquidation of the Participant's assets, unless such liquidation itself would cause a severe financial hardship. Distributions made pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee has reviewed and approved the request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions due to Unforeseeable Emergencies shall only be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Treasury under Code Section 409A. 6.9 Source of Assets for Benefits. All Vested Benefits shall be paid first from the Trust, to the extent assets exist in the Trust and then, as necessary, by the Employer from other general assets. 6.10 Forfeitures. Any Forfeitures shall be allocated to all Participants who received a Company Contributed Deferred Amount for that Plan Year in the same manner as the Profit Sharing Plan. 6.11 Withholding of Taxes. The Employer shall have the right to require Participants to remit to the Employer an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, and local tax withholding requirements, or to deduct from all payments made pursuant to the Plan amounts sufficient to satisfy such withholding requirements. Article 7. Individual Accounts 7.1 Participants' Accounts. The Employer shall establish and maintain individual Accounts for the Deferred Amounts made by each Participant hereunder. Each Account may be further subdivided into subaccounts for the purpose of tracking the funds associated with each different form of payment and each Expatriate Deferral, if any. The establishment and maintenance of Participants' Accounts, however, shall not be construed as entitling any Participant to any specific assets of an Employer. 7.2 Deferred Amounts. Deferred Amounts shall be credited to a Participant's Account on the date of funding pursuant to Section 8.6. 7.3 Earnings and Losses. Each Participant's Account shall be credited with earnings (or losses) thereon daily or some less frequent time period as agreed upon by the Committee and the Trustee. Such earnings (or losses) shall be based upon the actual returns achieved pursuant to the Investment Elections of each Participant. 7.4 Distributions. There shall be charged against each Participant's Account any payments of Vested Benefits made to the Participant or to a Participant's Beneficiary and any Forfeitures associated therewith. 7.5 Participant Statements. Statements that identify the Participant's Account balance shall be provided to Participants on a basis no less frequent than quarterly. Article 8. The Trust 8.1 Establishment of Irrevocable Trust. The Company shall establish an Irrevocable Trust, governed by the Trust Agreement, (which shall be a grantor trust within the meaning of Code Sections 671-678) with the Company as the grantor, for the benefit of Plan Participants and Beneficiaries of Participants, as appropriate. The Trust shall receive and hold the Deferred Amounts, and earnings (or losses) thereon, and shall make the payments provided by the Plan. The Trust fund shall be held and invested by the Trustee at the direction of the Committee and in accordance with the Trust Agreement. 8.2 Trustee. The Trust shall have an independent Trustee (such Trustee to have a fiduciary duty to carry out the terms and conditions of this Plan) as selected by the Company, and shall have restrictions as to the Company's ability to amend the Trust or to cancel benefits provided thereunder. Except to the extent that investments of the Trust fund are subject to the direction of the Committee pursuant to Section 8.3, or to the direction of investment managers appointed pursuant to Section 8.4, the Trustee shall have the sole and exclusive responsibility for investing the Trust fund. 8.3 Investment Funds. Except as provided in Section 8.4, the Trust shall consist of two or more separate investment funds as selected from time to time by the Committee among which Participants may elect to have their respective Deferred Amounts invested. Subject to the provision of Section 8.4, the Committee shall have the authority to select and change the number of investment funds available and to set the investment guidelines of each investment fund and to otherwise set policy and establish the funding strategies utilized by the Trust as the Committee may deem appropriate. All or any portion of any investment fund may, on a temporary basis, be retained in cash or invested in property other than that specified as the primary type of investment for such investment fund. Any investment fund may be partially or entirely invested in any common or commingled fund which is invested in property of the kind specified for such investment fund. 8.4 Investment Managers. The Committee may designate one or more investment managers to control and manage (including the power to direct the acquisition and disposition of) the investment funds and to make professional investment decisions or recommendations. The Committee shall not be liable for any act or omission of such investment managers, except as required by law. 8.5 Assets. Assets contained in the Trust shall at all times be specifically subject to the claims of the Employer's general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency; such terms shall be specifically defined within the provisions of the Trust, along with a required procedure for notifying the Trustee of any such bankruptcy or insolvency. (See Section 11.5) 8.6 Funding. The Employer shall contribute cash or cash equivalents to the Trust for the benefit of Participants as soon as practicable after the amount of each component comprising the Deferred Amounts is known for each respective Participant. The aggregate amount to be so contributed by the Employer on a periodic basis to the Trust shall be equal to the aggregate Deferred Amounts of all Participants pursuant to Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. Article 9. Investment Elections and Allocations 9.1 Investment Election. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.4, each Participant shall make an Investment Election to invest his or her Account among the investment funds provided for in Section 8.3 in any combination in multiples of one percent (1%). To the extent that a Participant shall have made no election hereunder, such Participant's Account shall be allocated to the investment fund having investment guidelines that contemplate the least risk of loss of principal as determined by the Committee. To the extent that a Participant makes no new election provided for hereunder in accordance with Section 5.6, the allocation of his or her Account among the investment funds shall remain unchanged. 9.2 Change of Prior Election. Subject to rules and procedures as the Committee may establish, each Participant may change the allocation of his Account among the investment funds provided for in Section 8.3 by making a new Investment Election. The Committee shall have the authority and discretion to limit reallocation or trading practices that the Committee or an Investment Manager determines to be abusive or adverse to the investment fund or to the interests of other Plan participants. 9.3 Form of Election. The Investment Elections shall be made in such form and in such manner as the Committee shall prescribe. 9.4 Transfer of Funds. When an amount or amounts must be transferred between investment funds by reason of a Participant's election hereunder, such amount shall be transferred to one or more of the other investment funds pursuant to such election as soon as practical. 9.5 Allocating Distributions. Any time a distribution (as defined in Section 7.4) of part or all of the amount allocated to the Account of a Participant is made pursuant to this Plan, a pro rata share of such distribution shall be made from each investment fund in which said Account is invested. Article 10. Beneficiary Designation 10.1 Designation of Beneficiary. Each Participant shall be entitled to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries who, upon the Participant's death, shall receive the amounts that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant under the Plan. All designations shall be signed by the Participant, and shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee. The Participant may change his or her designation of Beneficiary at any time, on a form prescribed by the Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form by a Participant shall automatically revoke all prior designations by that Participant. 10.2 Death of Beneficiary. In the event that all the Beneficiaries named by a Participant, pursuant to Section 10.1 herein, predecease the Participant, the Deferred Amounts that would have been paid to the Participant shall be paid to the Participant's estate. 10.3 Ineffective Designation. In the event the Participant does not designate a Beneficiary, or for any reason such designation is ineffective in whole or in part, the ineffectively designated amounts shall be paid to the Participant's estate. Article 11. Amendment and Termination 11.1 Right to Terminate and Amend. The Company hereby reserves the right to amend, modify, and/or terminate the Plan at any time. While the Company contemplates carrying out the provisions of the Plan indefinitely, the Company shall be under no obligation or liability to maintain the Plan for any minimum or other amount of time. 11.2 Notice of Termination. Upon any termination of the Plan in its entirety, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the members of the Committee, the Trustee, and to each Participant. 11.3 Effect of Termination. Except as provided by law, upon any termination of the Plan, the Company shall thereafter be under no obligation, liability, or responsibility to make any future Contribution or other payment to the Trustee on behalf of any Participant or any other person, trust, or fund for any purpose under or in connection with the Plan except as provided in Section 13.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all other provisions of the Plan concerning the investment of Accounts and distribution of benefits shall continue. No distributions of any Deferred Amounts shall be made or accelerated on account of the termination of the Plan except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A of the Code or regulations issued thereunder. 11.4 Limitations on Amendments. The provisions of this Article 11 are subject to and limited by the following restrictions: (a) No such amendment or termination shall in any manner adversely affect any Participant's rights to Contributions previously made, or to Pay previously deferred, or earnings thereon, without the consent of the Participant. (b) The provisions of the Trust may not be amended or modified except by the written consent of both the Company and the Trustee. 11.5 Merger, Consolidation, Reorganization, or Transfer. The merger, consolidation, or reorganization of the Company, or the sale or transfer by it of all or substantially all of its assets shall not terminate the Plan if there is delivery to the Company by the Company's successor or by the purchaser of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, of a written instrument requesting that the successor or purchaser be substituted for the Company and agreeing to perform all the provisions hereof which the Company is required to perform. Upon the receipt of said instrument, with the approval of the Company, the successor or the purchaser shall be substituted for the Company herein, and the Company shall be relieved and released from any obligations of any kind, character, or description herein or in any trust agreement imposed upon it. Article 12. Participation In And Withdrawal from the Plan By An Employer 12.1 Affiliate Participation in the Plan.

The adoption resolution may contain such specific changes and variations in Plan or Trust Agreement terms and provisions applicable to such adopting Employer and its employees as may be acceptable to the Company and the Trustee. However, the sole, exclusive right of any other amendment of whatever kind or extent to the Plan or Trust Agreement is reserved by the Company. The Company may not amend specific changes and variations in the Plan or Trust Agreement terms and provisions as adopted by the Employer in its adoption resolution without the consent of such Employer. The adoption resolution shall become, as to such adopting organization and its employees, a part of this Plan as then amended or thereafter amended and the related Trust Agreement. It shall not be necessary for the adopting organization to sign or execute the original or then amended Plan and Trust Agreement documents. The coverage date of the Plan for any such adopting organization shall be that stated in the resolution or decision of adoption, and from and after such effective date, such adopting organization shall assume all the rights, obligations, and liabilities of an individual employer entity hereunder and under the Trust Agreement. The administrative powers and control of the Company, as provided in the Plan and Trust Agreement, including the sole right to amendment, and of appointment and removal of the Committee, the Trustee, and their successors, shall not be diminished by reason of the participation of any such adopting organization in the Plan and Trust Agreement. 12.2 Withdrawal from the Plan. Any Employer, by action of its board of directors or other governing authority, may withdraw from the Plan and Trust Agreement after giving 90 days' notice to the Company, provided the Company consents to such withdrawal. The Company shall thereafter be under no obligation, liability or responsibility to make any future contribution or other payment to the Trustee on behalf of any employee or any other person with respect to such Employer under the Plan.

In no event shall the Employer make any payment under the Plan to any assignee or creditor of a Participant or to any assignee or creditor of a Participant's Beneficiary. 13.3 Successors. All obligations of the Employer under the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor to the Employer, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Employer. 13.4 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 13.5 Applicable Law.

GENERAL 1.1 Name of Plan - The name of this plan shall be the MOLEX DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (hereinafter the "PLAN"). 1.2 Purpose - The purpose of the PLAN is to extend to outside directors of MOLEX INCORPORATED (hereinafter referred to as "MOLEX") a vehicle under which they may elect in advance to defer and invest future earnings in order to provide a settlement source of funds at retirement. 1.3 Effective Date - The effective date of the PLAN is January 1, 2005. 1.4 Plan Year - The PLAN YEAR shall be a year commencing July 1 and ending the following June 30 until December 31, 2004.

ARTICLE II. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT 2.1 Establishment of Account - A separate deferred compensation account (hereinafter "ACCOUNT") will be established and maintained for each PARTICIPANT. 2.2 Aggregate Value of Account - The AGGREGATE VALUE of a PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT will be determined by the amount of compensation that the PARTICIPANT elects to defer ("DEFERRED COMP") plus the value added (or subtracted) from interest on cash equivalents, dividends and stock appreciation on stock equivalents depending on the growth pattern as more fully set forth in ARTICLE IV hereof. 2.3 Allocation of Deferred Compensation - DEFERRED COMP will be credited to the PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT as of the date such compensation would otherwise have been payable. ARTICLE III. INCOME TO BE DEFERRED 3.1 Type of Income - For each PLAN YEAR, a PARTICIPANT may defer any portion of his or her directors' fees. 3.2 Minimum Deferral - Any DEFERRED COMP for each PLAN YEAR must be at least $1,000.00 on an annual basis. ARTICLE IV.

The PARTICIPANT will be able to select an alternate growth pattern for future deferrals in other PLAN YEARS. 4.2 Interest Bearing Account - If an Interest Bearing Account is elected, the DEFERRED COMP for a particular PLAN YEAR will be treated as a cash ACCOUNT with interest compounded quarterly.

The resulting number of UNITS shall be credited to the PARTICIPANT and said UNITS shall be increased by imputing dividends (either cash or stock) on each UNIT or fraction thereof which is credited to the PARTICIPANT under the PLAN on each dividend payable date. Such dividend UNITS will be converted into additional UNITS on the basis of current market value of the STOCK on the applicable payable date. At the time of payment of any portion of the ACCOUNT, the UNITS will be converted into cash by multiplying the number of UNITS to be paid at the payment date by the current fair market value of the STOCK as of the payment date.
