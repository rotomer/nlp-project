On September 6, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved revisions to the fiscal year 2006 cash merit bonus plan for executive officers. An overview of the amended and restated fiscal 2006 cash merit bonus plan (the "cash merit bonus plan") is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary of the cash merit bonus plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. The cash merit bonus plan covers all executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer. This plan provides that cash bonuses, calculated as a percentage of base salary, will be paid to executive officers based on the achievement of two components: a certain profit before tax goal and individual performance objectives. The cash bonus opportunity for executive officers under such plan ranges from 0% to 150% of base salary. Payments to executive officers under the plan may be more or less than a target bonus as a function of the Company's results and individual performance. The cash bonus opportunity is 30% of base salary based on achievement of minimum performance goals, 60% of base salary based on achievement of target performance goals (the "Target" referenced in Exhibit 99.1) and 120% of base salary based on achievement of maximum performance goals. If the minimum performance goals are not achieved, no bonus is payable under this plan. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may downwardly adjust the potential bonus award to a lesser percentage, if any, to take into consideration unusual events. In addition, the Committee, in its discretion, may award an additional percentage not to exceed 30% of base salary to reflect unusual contributions to Molex.

Exhibit 99.2 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS RECORD REVENUE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 Reaffirms September quarter and fiscal year 2006 outlook Completes Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 compliance Investor meetings to be held in Chicago, San Francisco and New York Lisle, IL, USA - September 8, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended June 30, 2005, including record revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The Company also announced that the audit of its financial statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 has been completed, and that the financial results for those fiscal years remain as previously reported. FY2005 Fourth Quarter Results - ----------------------------- Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was $643.8 million, an increase of $11.9 million, or 1.9% over the prior year quarter. Revenue in local currencies decreased 1.0%, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $16.9 million over the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen and euro. Revenue in the Far East South region was $192.0 million, an increase of 9.0% over the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by demand from the digital consumer, PC, and mobile phone markets. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $131.0 million, an increase of 1.4% in dollars and a decrease of 2.3% in local currencies. In the Americas, revenue of $187.8 million increased 1.2%. In Europe, revenue of $125.3 million remained flat in dollars and declined 6.3% in local currencies. Net Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was $4.9 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with $57.2 million, or $0.30 per share in the prior year quarter. The Company continues to realign its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and optimize plant utilization. As a result, the Company recorded a previously announced restructuring charge of $27.9 million ($21.6 million after- tax) in the fourth fiscal quarter. The Company also recorded previously announced charges that included a non-cash goodwill impairment of $22.9 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), and building impairment of $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax). The reduction per share from these charges was $0.24. In addition, other non-operating items primarily related to tax adjustments increased net income by $5.4 million, or $0.03 per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 60.4%, principally impacted by the goodwill impairment charge for which no tax benefit was provided, and by a reduction of tax reserves. In addition, during the fourth fiscal quarter the Company adjusted the full fiscal year tax rate to 28.8%, compared with 27.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Full FY2005 Results - ------------------- Revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 was a record $2.549 billion compared with $2.247 billion in the prior fiscal year, a 13.4% increase. Revenue in local currencies increased 10.2%, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $72.1 million over the prior fiscal year. Net income was $154.4 million, or $0.81 per share, compared with $176.0 million, or $0.92 per share in the prior fiscal year. These results for fiscal 2005 include a $0.24 per share reduction due to the charges mentioned above. The Company's order backlog on June 30, 2005 was $259.5 million, compared with $332.6 million on June 30, 2004. This decrease was partially attributable to significantly higher distribution orders recorded in the June fiscal 2004 quarter in advance of a price increase. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company provided additional vendor-managed inventory to customers. Under this method, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. New orders for the fourth quarter were $651.6 million, up 7.2% sequentially, and have continued at an encouraging pace in the current September quarter. Cash and marketable securities were $497.6 million at June 30, 2005, compared with $447.2 million at March 31, 2005 and $338.7 million at June 30, 2004. Research and Development and Capital Spending - --------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32.9 million, compared with $34.8 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenditures for the twelve-month period were $133.6 million, compared with $119.0 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $75.7 million, up 36.5% compared with the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the twelve-month period were $230.9 million, up 21.7% compared with $189.7 million for the same period last year. Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was $55.2 million, compared with $57.6 million for the same period last year. Depreciation expense for the twelve-month period was $227.7 million, compared with $225.2 million for fiscal 2004. Stock Buyback Actions - --------------------- During the June quarter, the Company repurchased 1,030,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 425,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $34.6 million. These purchases were completed under a $250 million Board authorization for the period ending December 30, 2006. The Company has approximately $215 million remaining under the current authorization. September Quarter and FY2006 Outlook - ------------------------------------ Based on a current review of its forecast operating results, the Company remains comfortable with its guidance for operating results for the first quarter ending September 30, 2005, and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, as provided in its July 26, 2005 press release. FY2003 and FY2004 Audit - ----------------------- As previously announced on July 19, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors requested Ernst & Young LLP to audit the Company's financial statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 in addition to its fiscal 2005 audit. This has now been completed and the financial results for those fiscal years remain as previously reported. Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 Compliance - ------------------------------------- The Company completed its assessment of internal control as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005.
