MOLEX REPORTS RECORD REVENUE FOR 2006 FISCAL FIRST QUARTER
New Orders Up 11 Percent Compared to Prior Year Quarter
Provides December Fiscal Second Quarter Outlook
Lisle, IL, USA  October 20, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported record revenue for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005.
First Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $659.8 million, an increase of 3% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies rose 2%, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $9.4 million compared with last years first quarter. Revenue for the September quarter increased 3% sequentially from the quarter ended June 30, 2005.
Revenue in the Far East South region, the Companys largest region, was $218.1 million, an increase of 15% over last years first quarter in dollars and 13% in local currencies. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $127.5 million, a decrease of 3% in dollars and 5% in local currencies. In the Americas region, revenue of $185.2 million increased by 5%. In Europe, revenue of $114.5 million decreased 11% in dollars and 11% in local currencies compared with last years first quarter.
Net income for the September quarter was $46.7 million, or $0.25 per share, compared with $52.5 million, or $0.28 per share in the prior year quarter. Included in these results was a restructuring charge of $4.9 million ($3.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.02 per share), relating to previously announced restructuring activity.
Selling, general and administrative expense was $161.4 million for the September quarter compared with $155.3 million for the prior year quarter and $155.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. Selling, general and administrative expense included a provision of $5.7 million ($3.6 million after-tax or approximately $0.02 per share) for a potentially uncollectible account receivable from an automotive customer that filed for bankruptcy. Selling, general and administrative expense also included the effect of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.123(R), Share-Based Payment, which increased expense by $3.1 million ($2.2 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share).
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, consistent with prior guidance, but higher than the 27.0% rate in the prior year quarter.
Cash and marketable securities were $423.2 million at September 30, 2005, compared with $497.6 million at June 30, 2005 and $331.4 million at September 30, 2004. As described below, during the September quarter the Company spent $50.1 million to repurchase its common stock.
New Orders and Backlog
New orders for the first quarter of $693.2 million were encouraging, an increase of 11% over the prior year September quarter, and an increase of 6% sequentially from the quarter ended June 30, 2005. New orders for the first quarter reached their highest level since the June 2000 quarter. The Companys order backlog on September 30, 2005 was $288.0 million, compared with $313.6 million on September 30, 2004. A portion of this decline is due to the increased prevalence of providing vendor-managed inventory to customers. Under this method, the receipt of the new order and the shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. The September quarter backlog increased 11% from $259.5 million on June 30, 2005.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the September quarter were $34.6 million, compared with $33.4 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $64.1 million, compared with $48.4 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the September quarter included approximately $10 million for buildings, primarily for expansion in China and facility consolidation within the Americas due to the restructuring. Depreciation expense was $53.4 million, compared with $56.5 million for the same period last fiscal year.
December 2005 Second Quarter Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005, will improve sequentially to a range of $670 to $690 million. This represents an increase of 3 to 6 percent compared with last years second fiscal quarter. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.26 to $0.29. This forecast includes an estimated restructuring charge of $3.5 million ($2.5 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share) related to the previously announced restructuring activity.
Restructuring Charge Update for Fiscal 2006
The Company now expects that the total pretax restructuring charge for fiscal 2006 will be in a range of $15 to $20 million, compared with a previous estimate of $15 to $25 million.
Stock Buyback Actions
During the September quarter, the Company repurchased 1,430,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 543,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $50.1 million.
