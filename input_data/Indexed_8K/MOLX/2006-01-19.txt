Lisle, IL, USA  January 19, 2006 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported record revenue and orders for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.  In addition, the Company raised guidance for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2006.  
Second Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, was a record $697.3 million, an increase of 7.0% over the same period last fiscal year.  Revenue in local currencies rose 8.5%, as currency translation lowered net revenue by approximately $9.9 million, compared with last years second quarter.  Revenue for the December quarter increased 5.7% sequentially from the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
Net income for the December quarter was $58.5 million, or $0.31 per share, compared with $52.2 million, or $0.27 per share in the prior year quarter.  Included in the current quarter results was a restructuring charge of $6.5 million ($5.0 million after-tax or approximately $0.03 per share), relating to a previously announced restructuring program.
Revenue in the mobile phone market was very strong and increased 20% over last years second quarter, and 10% sequentially.  Revenue in the consumer market was also strong, increasing 12% over last year, and 11% sequentially.  Revenue in the automotive market increased 13% over last year, and was flat sequentially.  Revenue in the data products and industrial markets was flat, versus both the prior year and sequentially.
Revenue in the Far East South region, the Companys largest region, was $235 million, an increase of 15% over last years second quarter in dollars, and a similar increase in local currencies.  In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $130 million, a decline of 3% in dollars and an increase of 2% in local currencies.  In the Americas region, revenue of $198 million rose 16%, the highest growth rate in several years.  In Europe, revenue of $117 million declined 9% in dollars and 3% in local currencies compared with last years second quarter.  
Selling, general and administrative expense was $159.8 million for the December quarter, compared with $153.8 million for the prior year quarter and $161.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.  SG&A expense included a reduction of $2.7 million ($1.9 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share), due to factoring an account receivable that the Company had provided for in the September 2005 quarter.  SG&A expense also included the effect of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.123(R), Share-Based Payment, which increased expense by $2.9 million ($2.1 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share).
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%.  This tax rate is consistent with prior guidance, but higher than the 27.0% rate in the prior year quarter, primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings by country.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented, We were very pleased with our financial results for the December quarter.  The mobile phone and consumer markets were very strong and had a significant impact on our revenue growth and profit improvement.  In these markets, our growth was partially driven by our new products and design wins at the leading manufacturers.   In the Americas, we were pleased with our growth in the distribution and medical electronics markets.  Our growth in automotive was primarily due to the introduction of new products.
Slark continued, Our restructuring efforts are moving forward.  We were pleased with the 40 basis point sequential improvement in gross profit margin, despite a difficult raw material cost environment.  A considerable number of our management initiatives are devoted to reducing manufacturing overhead and improving margins on an individual product basis.  While a portion of the gross margin improvement was due to increased revenue, especially in our higher profit markets, we believe our internal efforts are working and contributed to this improvement.
Cash and marketable securities were $419.8 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $423.2 million at September 30, 2005 and $412.0 million at December 31, 2004.  As described below, during the December quarter the Company spent $45.0 million to repurchase its common stock.
Orders and Backlog

The December quarter backlog increased 3.3%, from $288.0 million on September 30, 2005.

March 2006 Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006, will be in a range of $690 to $710 million.  This represents an increase of 12% to 15% compared with last years third fiscal quarter.  The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.28 to $0.30.  This represents an increase of 17% to 25% compared with last years third fiscal quarter.  This forecast includes an estimated restructuring charge of $4.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or approximately $0.02 per share) related to the previously announced restructuring activity.  
The Company now expects that revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 will be in a range of $2.725 to $2.800 billion, compared with previous guidance of $2.675 to $2.750 billion.  Based on these revenue expectations, earnings per share are estimated to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.19, compared with previous guidance of $1.07 to $1.12.  These earnings per share expectations include a restructuring charge of approximately $20.0 million ($15.0 million after-tax or approximately $0.08 per share).
The Company now expects that capital spending for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, will be in a range of $240 to $250 million, compared with previous guidance of $220 to $240 million.  This increase is primarily focused on capacity constrained products, such as micro-miniature board-to-board connectors and flash memory card sockets.
