Item 8.01
Other Events
     The Company has become aware of certain media articles that do not accurately describe certain aspects of the option misdating previously disclosed in the Company's August 2, 2006 press release. The executive stock options described in the press release, over the twelve fiscal years reviewed, were found to have been misdated in a number of instances to dates either before or after the date the options were approved by the Compensation Committee. Further, the option misdating was not the result of clerical error and the executive officer who was responsible for the misdating has been reassigned. Investors should rely on the Company's August 2, 2006 press release for information regarding this matter, which press release was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on August 2, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company assumes no responsibility for, and undertakes no obligation to correct or update, inaccurate media reports regarding this or other matters except to the extent required by law.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
