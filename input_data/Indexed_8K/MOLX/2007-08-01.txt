Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, IL, USA  August 1, 2007  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2007 fourth fiscal quarter and announced a 50% increase in the cash dividend.
2007 Fourth Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $791.8 million, an increase of 1.0% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies declined 0.9% as currency translation increased revenue by $14.9 million, compared with last year's June quarter. Revenue for the quarter included $54.7 million from Woodhead Industries, which the Company acquired on August 10, 2006.
Net income for the June quarter was $32.7 million, or $0.18 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a charge of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after-tax or approximately $0.16 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. Also included in the current quarter was the favorable resolution of an income tax contingency and other items amounting to approximately $0.04 per share. This compares with net income of $70.5 million, or $0.38 per share in the prior year quarter that included restructuring charges of $10.7 million ($7.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.04 per share). Currency translation increased net income by $0.3 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented, "The June quarter operating results were within our revised outlook announced on June 18, 2007. When compared with last year's June quarter, revenue increased in the industrial, automotive, medical and military portions of our business. However, the June quarter was significantly impacted by difficulties in the mobile phone market where revenue declined 15% from the March quarter, and by 30% compared to last year's June quarter. While the majority of these declines are customer specific, the overall mobile phone market is currently being driven by growth in entry level phones having lower functionality and connector content. We believe this is the result of initial demand in the developing economies, and that these large markets will eventually transition to more sophisticated higher content devices. Revenue in both the consumer and data markets declined by 5  6% compared to last year's June quarter, due in part to concerns regarding consumer spending as well as lingering inventory corrections at some larger customers."
 
Gross profit margin for the June quarter was 30.0%, compared with 31.1% in the March quarter, and 33.0% in last year's June quarter. The reduction from the March quarter was primarily due to revenue declines in several of the Company's more profitable markets, resulting in higher fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue. SG&A expense for the June quarter was 20.4% of revenue, compared with 20.1% in the March quarter, and 19.6% in last year's June quarter. The effective tax rate for the June quarter was 26.2%, reflecting a reduction in income tax expense due to the favorable resolution of an income tax contingency in the amount of $4.6 million, a change in mix of earnings in countries with tax rates that are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset by various tax adjustments.
2007 Fiscal Full Year Results
Revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007 was $3.27 billion, an increase of 14.1% compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies increased 11.8% as currency translation increased revenue by $60.2 million compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue for the year included $202.5 million from Woodhead Industries, which the Company acquired on August 10, 2006. Revenue increased 9% in the consumer market, 3% in the telecom market (including both infrastructure and mobile), and 6% in the data market. Revenue in the automotive market increased 11%. Revenue in the industrial market, including the acquisition of Woodhead Industries increased 100% and by 16% excluding Woodhead.
Net income was $240.8 million, or $1.30 per share. Included in the fiscal year results was a restructuring charge of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after-tax or approximately $0.16 per share). Also included in the fiscal year were favorable tax and other adjustments of approximately $0.04 per share. Currency translation increased net income by $1.2 million when compared to the prior year. These results compare with net income of $236.1 million, or $1.26 per share for the prior year. Included in the prior year results was a restructuring charge of $26.4 million ($19.2 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).
Orders and Backlog
Orders for the June quarter were $775.8 million, compared with $785.2 million in the prior year June quarter, and $782.8 million in the March quarter. The Company's order backlog on June 30, 2007 was $332.5 million, compared with $370.0 million in the prior year June quarter, and $345.9 million in the March quarter. Woodhead Industries contributed bookings of $58.6 million to the current quarter, and had a backlog of $24.3 million on June 30, 2007.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the June quarter were $37.4 million, compared with $35.7 million in the prior year June quarter. Capital expenditures for the June quarter were $77.4 million, compared with $82.9 million in the prior year June quarter. Depreciation expense was $59.9 million, compared with $53.7 million in the prior year June quarter.
Cash and Working Capital
During the June quarter total cash increased by $87.8 million to $460.9 million. Accounts receivable declined by $7.2 million and the level of accounts receivable outstanding improved by 2 days. Inventory declined by $22.7 million with a reduction in days outstanding of 2 days.
 
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.1125 per share, an increase of 50 percent from the previous cash dividend of $0.075 per share. The new regular quarterly cash dividend will be payable on October 25, 2007 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2007 for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board. Martin P. Slark commented, "The cash dividend has been increased by 200% since the beginning of fiscal 2006. The current increase reflects our current strong financial position, and the expected improvement in return on invested capital from our reorganization and restructuring actions."
Stock Buyback Actions
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 415,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 130,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $14.9 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of common stock through September 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, approximately $15.2 million was remaining under this authorization.
Reorganization and Restructuring Update
The Company has transitioned to a new global organization structure effective July 1, 2007. The new structure realigns the company into five product-focused global divisions and one global sales and marketing division and replaces the previous geographic based regional organization. When the Company announced this initiative on August 2, 2006, it mentioned a major benefit would be to leverage its global resources and streamline operations. As a result, significant opportunities to reduce cost and to improve return on invested capital have been identified and are now being implemented.
On June 18, 2007 the Company announced a restructuring plan that is expected to result in pre-tax charges of $100 to $125 million. The plan includes head-count reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures. As previously mentioned, the Company recorded $36.9 million of the total pretax charge in the June 2007 quarter, including $28.2 million for employee termination costs and $8.7 million for manufacturing asset impairments or write-offs.
During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the Company will focus on reducing operating costs consistent with its goal of improving return on invested capital. In a global industry with short order lead-times and an extremely diversified range in both number and complexity of products, the manufacturing component of restructuring must be approached sequentially to avoid any potential impact to delivery performance. This phased approach is reflected in the Company's financial guidance for fiscal 2008. Based on the current implementation schedule, the Company estimates that approximately $35 million of the remaining estimated pretax restructuring charge of $65 to $85 million will be recorded in fiscal 2008, with the remainder in fiscal 2009. The Company expects that when fully implemented by the close of fiscal year 2009, the annualized pretax savings from the restructuring activities will be in the range of $75 to $100 million. The Company estimates pretax savings of $20 to $25 million in fiscal 2008.
 
2008 Fiscal Year and First Fiscal Quarter Outlook
The Company believes it has a strong competitive position in its major markets which is being enhanced by the global reorganization. In addition, the Company's current financial position is strong and supportive of new product development and strategic acquisitions.
Although the direction of the global economy is uncertain, the Company believes that it is useful to provide its initial outlook for the coming year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, revenue is estimated in a range of $3.25 to $3.35 billion. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $1.25 to $1.33. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.15 per share. The Company's revenue estimate is based upon the current level of orders and the expectation of low single-digit growth in the connector market. The outlook has been tempered by signs of a potential contraction in consumer spending primarily in the developed economies. The estimate also includes a reduction of approximately $70 million in revenue compared with fiscal year 2007 from non-core businesses the Company has exited.
The Company expects that revenue for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2007, will be in a range of $770 to $800 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.25 to $0.29. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.01 per share.
The Company estimates that capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 will be in a range of $280 to $310 million. Capital expenditures were $296.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.
