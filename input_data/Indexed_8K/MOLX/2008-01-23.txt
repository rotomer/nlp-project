Lisle, IL, USA  January 23, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2008 second fiscal quarter.
2008 Second Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was $841.6 million, an increase of 0.5% over the same period last fiscal year and 6.2% over the September 2007 quarter. Revenue in local currencies declined 4.0% as currency translation increased revenue by $37.5 million compared with last year's December quarter.
When compared with the September quarter, revenue in the telecom communications market increased 12.4%, primarily due to a 14.3% increase in revenue for mobile phones. Revenue in the data and consumer markets increased 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively. Revenue in the automotive market increased 3.8%, primarily due to gains in Japan and Europe. Revenue in the industrial market declined 2.3%.
Net income for the December quarter was $59.2 million, or $0.33 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a pretax charge of $7.3 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, relating to the previously announced restructuring program. Earnings per share were $0.36 in the prior year December quarter and $0.29 in the September 2007 quarter.
Gross profit margin for the December quarter was 30.1%, compared with 29.8% in the September quarter and 30.9% in the prior year December quarter. The reduction from last year was due primarily to price erosion and the higher material purchase costs for gold. The average market price of gold for the quarter increased 28% when compared with the prior year quarter. The Company continues to benefit from a gold hedge covering close to one-half of fiscal 2008 usage.
SG&A expense for the December quarter was 19.7% of revenue, compared with 20.3% in the September quarter, and 20.0% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the December quarter was 30.0%.
 
Orders for the December quarter were $858.9 million, increasing 10.3% compared with the prior year quarter and 5.8% sequentially. Order growth in telecom was excellent, again due to the improving mobile phone market. The Company's order backlog on December 31, 2007 was $374.7 million, compared with $375.9 million in the prior year December quarter, and $353.3 million in the September quarter.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented on the quarter, "Revenue reached a record level and earnings per share was at the high end of our outlook. We were also encouraged that sequential trends remained positive with a 1.02 book to bill ratio for the quarter. Gross profit margin improved when compared with the September quarter, and our cost reduction program is on track. We have now completed two quarters under the new product division organization and the results to date are encouraging. The product divisions have already demonstrated the potential under this structure to reduce capital spending and control headcount and other resources. In addition, the global sales and marketing organization has successfully transitioned without any adverse impact to customers or our traditional order patterns. As the product divisions work to execute their new global strategies, we expect the benefits of the new organization to increasingly contribute to our financial results."
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the December quarter were $43.1 million, compared with $40.4 million in the prior year December quarter. Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $53.3 million, compared with $80.2 million in the prior year December quarter and $49.1 million in the September quarter. Capital expenditures for the first two quarters of fiscal 2008 were $102.4 million, or 6.3% of revenue, compared to $155.8 million, or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period. This reduction is consistent with the Company's goal of increasing asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth.
Depreciation expense was $60.3 million, compared with $58.3 million in the prior year December quarter and $58.6 million in the September quarter.
Cash and Working Capital
During the December quarter, total cash declined by $4.7 million to $442.6 million. This includes $51.2 million used to repurchase stock. Total accounts receivable and inventory days remained at approximately the same levels as in the September quarter.
Six-Month Results
Revenue for the six-months ended December 31, 2007 was $1.63 billion, a decrease of 2.0% compared with the prior fiscal year. During this period currency translation increased revenue by $53.3 million. Net income of $112.5 million, or $0.61 per share, declined 21.2% compared with last year's net income of $142.7 million, or $0.77 per share. Included in the current fiscal results was a pretax charge of $9.9 million, or approximately $0.04 per share, relating to the restructuring program.

Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 400,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $51.2 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2008, and approximately $88.2 million remains under this authorization.
Third Quarter Outlook
The Company entered the third quarter with a very strong balance sheet, and its cost reduction initiatives proceeding as planned. Business levels improved during the second quarter, especially outside the United States. We are benefiting from our considerable global presence both in demand and stronger currency translation. While forecasting the short-term environment is difficult given the global economic uncertainty, we believe that aggregate inventory within the supply chain is at reasonable levels. While the Company has not seen a reduction in demand, lead-times and visibility remain short term. The Company believes that its cost reduction initiatives, as well as the progress shown in lowering capital investment, are prudent steps, especially during times of economic uncertainty.
The Company expects that revenue for the third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2008, will be in a range of $820 to $860 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.31 to $0.35. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.02 per share.
