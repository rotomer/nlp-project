Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, IL, USA  April 22, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2008 third fiscal quarter.
2008 Third Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was $822.3 million, an increase of 1.9% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies declined 4.4% as currency translation increased revenue by $51.1 million compared with last year's March quarter.
When compared with the same period last fiscal year, revenue in the telecom market increased 5.7%. Revenue in the data and consumer electronics markets increased 8.7% and 1.7% respectively. Revenue in the automotive market increased 5.4%, due to gains in Japan and Europe. Revenue in the industrial market declined 18.4%, the result of divesting certain low margin businesses and a delay in shipments related to a seasonal project.
Net income for the March quarter was $50.3 million, or $0.28 per share. Included in the current quarter was an after-tax charge of $4.9 million ($0.03 per share) relating to the previously announced restructuring program and an income tax charge of $10.5 million ($0.06 per share) due to foreign tax credit adjustments resulting from the recent filing of our fiscal 2007 tax return. Without these charges, earnings per share would have been $0.37 per share. Earnings per share were $0.33 (including a restructuring charge of $0.02) in the December 2007 quarter and $0.35 in the prior year March quarter.
Gross profit margin for the March quarter was 30.9%, improving to the highest level since the prior year March quarter when gross profit margin was 31.1%. SG&A expense for the March quarter was 20.4% of revenue, compared with 19.7% in the December quarter, and 20.1% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the March quarter was 42.1%, reflecting the income tax charge mentioned previously.
 
Orders for the March quarter were $898.0 million, increasing 14.7% compared with the prior year quarter and 4.5% sequentially. Orders have increased sequentially in each of the three quarters during the current fiscal year. Year over year order growth was strong in all major markets, with the exception of the industrial market which was flat. Compared with the prior year quarter, order growth in the telecom market was very strong increasing by 35%. Order growth was strong in the data and consumer electronics markets which increased 13.0% and 11.1% respectively. Order growth in the medical electronics market was 14.1%. While the medical electronics market currently represents only 2.7% of total revenue, the Company expects significant long term growth in this market coincidental with the aging population demographics.
The Company's order backlog on March 31, 2008 increased 33.2% to $461.0 million, compared with $346.0 million in the prior year March quarter. Backlog as of December 2007 was $375.0 million.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman, commented on the third quarter, "We were very pleased with our operating results, especially the sequential improvement in gross profit margin. Since the transition to the new global product division and sales and marketing organization, we have made steady progress in improving operating efficiencies. We have also reduced capital spending as a percentage of revenue by 210 basis points during the current fiscal year. In the March quarter our restructuring activities advanced significantly with the completion of our plant expansion in China."
"Demand trends were very positive with record new orders and a 1.09 book to bill ratio. We believe this demonstrates the enhanced ability of our global sales and marketing organization to generate additional business including design wins in our customers new products."
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the March quarter were $41.7 million, compared with $40.6 million in the prior year March quarter. Capital expenditures for the March quarter were $61.0 million, compared with $63.6 million in the prior year March quarter. Capital expenditures for the first three quarters of fiscal 2008 were 6.7% of revenue, compared with 8.8% of revenue in the prior year period. This reduction is consistent with the Company's goal of increasing asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth.
Depreciation expense was $61.8 million, compared with $58.3 million in the prior year March quarter and $60.3 million in the December quarter.
Nine-Month Results
Revenue for the nine-months ended March 31, 2008 was $2.46 billion, a decrease of 0.7% compared with the prior fiscal year. During the current fiscal year, currency translation increased revenue by $104.4 million. Net income of $162.8 million, or $0.89 per share declined 21.7% compared with last year's net income of $208.0 million, or $1.12 per share. Included in the current fiscal year results is an after-tax charge of $11.1 million ($0.06 per share) relating to the restructuring program and an income tax charge of $10.5 million ($0.06 per share) as a result of foreign tax credit adjustments resulting from the recent filing of our fiscal 2007 tax return.

Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2,085,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 325,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $54.4 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2008, and approximately $33.8 million remains under this authorization.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Martin P. Slark commented, "We entered the fourth quarter with considerable momentum. New orders in the third quarter were a record. We believe we have significant competitive advantage by combining our new product technologies with our global presence, both in access to stronger overseas demand and through the diversification of a global customer base. The recently implemented product division based organization is also providing opportunities to expand both sales and profits. In addition, the restructuring initiatives are moving forward, with increases in operating margins expected in fourth quarter."
As a result, the Company anticipates a sequential improvement in revenue and earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2008. The Company expects that revenue will be in a range of $850 to $890 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.36 to $0.40. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.03 per share.
