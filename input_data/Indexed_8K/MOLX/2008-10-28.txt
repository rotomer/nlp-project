Lisle, Ill., USA  October 28, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2009 first fiscal quarter.
2009 First Fiscal Quarter Results
Operating results were similar to the revised outlook provided on October 2, 2008. Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 was $839.0 million, an increase of 5.9% over the same period last fiscal year. Currency translation increased revenue by $44.0 million. Revenue using constant exchange rates was flat compared with last year's September quarter.
When compared with last year's September quarter, revenue increased in the telecom and data markets by 28% and 5% respectively. Revenue in the consumer and medical markets both increased by 5%. Revenue in the automotive and industrial markets declined by 11% and 9% respectively, reflecting the many economic issues impacting these markets.
Gross profit margin for the September quarter was 29.7%, compared with 29.8% in the prior year September quarter. SG&A expense for the September quarter was 19.8% of revenue, compared with 20.3% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in the SG&A expense ratio reflects a lower cost structure resulting from the restructuring initiative which began in fiscal 2007. The effective tax rate for the September quarter was 32.0%, compared with 30.0% in the prior year quarter.
Net income for the September quarter was $44.3 million, or $0.25 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a pretax charge of $21.8 million ($15.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.09 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. This compares with net income of $53.3 million, or $0.29 per share in the prior year quarter that included restructuring charges of $2.6 million ($1.5 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share).
Orders and Backlog
Orders for the September quarter were $795.9 million, compared with $811.5 million in the prior year September quarter. The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2008 was $385.5 million, compared with $353.3 million in the prior year September quarter.
 
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the September quarter were $43.5 million, compared with $39.9 million in the prior year September quarter. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $45.3 million, compared with $49.1 million in the prior year September quarter. The Company has already implemented plans to reduce capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 significantly below the low end of the range of its initial estimate of $230 million, and will make further reductions should economic conditions not improve
.
Restructuring Update
On August 5, 2008, the Company announced an increase in its restructuring plan through the end of fiscal year 2010, which now includes total estimated pretax charges of $125 to $140 million, and when fully completed estimated annualized pretax savings of $100 to $120 million. Cumulative restructuring charges of $89.9 million were recorded through September 30, 2008, and the Company estimates that the remaining restructuring charges in fiscal 2009 will approximate $45.0 million, with the remaining $5 million to be recognized in fiscal 2010.
The restructuring charge of $21.8 million recorded in the September quarter was primarily focused on reducing both the automotive and industrial manufacturing footprint and cost structure. This charge includes closures of a European manufacturing plant and a European design center supplying the automotive market, and two North American manufacturing plants supplying the industrial market. Also, on October 2 we announced the closure of a manufacturing plant in Japan.
nd
Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 732,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 900,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $38.8 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009, and approximately $161.2 million remains under this authorization.
Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2008, will be in a range of $750 to $800 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.18 to $0.22. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.04 per share.
Based on current global economic conditions, the Company has limited visibility to forecast revenue beyond one fiscal quarter, and as a result, will provide guidance for one quarter only at this time. The Company currently believes that operating results for fiscal 2009 will be below the range provided in its outlook on August 5, 2008, and cautions investors not to rely on prior estimates.
