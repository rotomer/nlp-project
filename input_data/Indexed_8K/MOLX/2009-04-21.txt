Lisle, Ill., USA  April 21, 2009  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2009 third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2009.
2009 Third Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 of $505.5 million was at the lower end of the range estimated in the release dated January 27, 2009. Revenue decreased 38.5% from the same period last fiscal year, and 24.2% from the December 2008 quarter. Revenue continued to be impacted by the global slowdown, made worse by customer initiatives to reduce their inventory. Revenue in local currencies fell 37.1% as currency translation decreased revenue by $12.0 million, compared with last year's March quarter.
Gross profit margin was 18.5%, compared with 30.9% in the prior year March quarter, and 26.4% in the December 2008 quarter. The decline in gross profit margin reflected lower absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from significantly lower production volume. SG&A expense declined $28.6 million from last year's March quarter and $5.5 million from the December 2008 quarter, due to the cost reduction and restructuring programs.
Net loss was $58.6 million, or ($0.34) per share. Included in the quarter results was a pretax restructuring charge of $44.3 million ($34.0 million after-tax or approximately $0.20 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. The March quarter compares with net income of $50.3 million, or $0.28 per share in the prior year quarter that included a pretax restructuring charge of $6.4 million, or approximately $0.03 per share after-tax. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3%.
Orders for the March quarter were $475 million, down 47% compared with the prior year quarter and down 16% from the December 2008 quarter. The Company's order backlog on March 31, 2009 was $251 million, compared with $461 million at March 31, 2008 and $285 million at December 31, 2008. Orders improved each month during the quarter, and the book to bill ratio was positive for the month of March.
Capital expenditures for the March 2009 quarter were $31.1 million, compared with $61.0 million in the prior year March quarter and $51.3 million in the December 2008 quarter. Capital spending during the March quarter was primarily for production tooling related to new product development. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 were $127.7 million or 6.3% of revenue, and included expenditures related to plant construction as part of the restructuring program. This compares with $163.4 million or 6.7% of revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2008. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were significantly reduced to maximize cash flow in this difficult economy and are now estimated in a range of $165 to $185 million for the full year. This compares with fiscal 2008 spending of $234.6 million.
 
Research and development expense was $34.9 million, compared with $41.7 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to salary reductions and cost containment activities. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 the Company released 158 new products. During the March quarter new design activity improved significantly, and consistent with the company's goal of remaining a technology leader in the industry, spending for R&D is expected to increase in subsequent quarters.
Cash flow from operations was $121.3 million for the March quarter and $311.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2009. Cash and marketable securities was $505.9 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of $48.2 million from December 31, 2008.
Martin P. Slark, CEO, commented on the quarter, "We believe that the revenue and orders for the quarter were below the level of current market demand, a result of inventory reductions within the supply chain. When combined with our initiatives to reduce our own inventory, manufacturing volume was below the level required to break-even on an operating basis. We have been aggressive in our response to the business environment, including making salary reductions for officers and salaried employees in the U.S. as well as in most international operations. In addition, we have lowered headcount by 25% over the last two quarters."
Slark continued, "During the quarter we also successfully managed our cash flow. For example, inventory declined by 19.5% sequentially, while accounts receivable declined by 26.0% sequentially and returned to a normal level of 75 days sales outstanding. Capital expenditures were tightly controlled and reduced to the lowest level in several years. These initiatives improved our cash position providing us with additional security during these tough times."
Restructuring Update
The restructuring charge of $44.3 million recorded in the March quarter was primarily related to severance for headcount reductions and the costs associated with plant closures. Since the end of the quarter the Company announced the closure of a manufacturing plant in Japan.
The total estimated pretax restructuring charge through the end of fiscal year 2010 has increased to a range of $240 to $250 million. Cumulative restructuring charges were $174 million through March 31, 2009, and the Company estimates that the additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2009 will approximate $50 million, with the remaining $20 to 25 million to be recognized in fiscal 2010. The expected annualized cost savings from the restructuring program is approximately $200 million.
Nine-Month Results
Revenue for the nine-months ended March 31, 2009 was $2.0 billion, a decline of 18.1% compared with the prior fiscal year. During this period, currency translation increased revenue by $33.1 million. Net loss of $101.5 million, or ($0.58) per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $105.9 million ($79.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.45 per share), and a pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $93.1 million, or $0.53 per share.

Outlook
The improved order rate in the month of March has continued through the date of this release, and we anticipate that both revenue and orders for the June quarter will be above the March quarter. While orders appear to have bottomed in the March quarter, future visibility remains limited. As a result, the Company considers it prudent to provide a wide range in its outlook, and estimates revenue in the range of $525 to $575 million for the June quarter.
The Company's cost reduction strategy includes both permanent and short term initiatives. The permanent cost initiatives should enhance financial leverage in the recovery. The short term actions are in response to the economic downturn and lower than normal revenue levels. We believe that this approach maximizes cash flow from operations, while retaining the level of resources and skills necessary to improve our competitive position when the global economy improves.
