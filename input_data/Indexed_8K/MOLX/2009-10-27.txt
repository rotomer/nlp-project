Lisle, Ill., USA  October 27, 2009  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that exceeded previously issued guidance.
 
Revenue for the September 2009 quarter of $674.0 million exceeded the high end of the outlook provided on September 21, 2009 of $665.0 million and increased 18% from the June 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 16%. Orders for the quarter were $724.4 million, an increase of 26% from the June 2009 quarter. Recovery in the data, consumer electronics and telecom markets exceeded expectations.
Net loss for the September 2009 quarter was $11.6 million, or $0.07 per share, compared with a net loss of $219.7 million, or $1.27 per share, for the June 2009 quarter. The range for the earnings per share outlook provided on September 21, 2009 was a loss of $0.08 to $0.12 per share.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the September 2009 quarter was $31.7 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with a net loss of $16.5 million, or $0.09 per share, in the June 2009 quarter. This result exceeded the upper end of the outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.16 per share. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded a pretax restructuring charge of $55.9 million ($38.5 million after-tax or $0.22 per share) and a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share. The tax adjustment is primarily due to the reversal of a tax benefit for a significant number of employee stock options that expired unexercised during the quarter.
 
Molex Chief Executive Officer, Martin P. Slark, commented on the quarter, "We continue to see month over month improvements in revenue and orders in virtually all of our key markets. The increase in orders of 26% from the June quarter was the second consecutive quarter of increasing orders and gives us strong momentum going into the December quarter. Order rates in two key markets, consumer electronics and data, surpassed prior year levels. As in the June quarter, we saw significant operating leverage as gross margin benefited from the increase in revenue and ongoing cost containment actions. This is strong evidence that our restructuring program is yielding the intended results. Looking forward, we are assessing the sustainability of the recovery as well as the impact of rising raw material costs and the weaker dollar."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2009:
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $680 to $720 million for the December 2009 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.11 to $0.15, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $19 million or $0.07 per share after-tax. Due to the limited visibility caused by current economic conditions, the Company will not provide full year guidance at this time.

Editor's note:
 
Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We refer to Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to describe earnings and earnings per share excluding the items referenced above. We believe that Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share provide useful information to investors because both provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share may be different from similar measures used by other companies.
