Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, Ill., USA  January 26, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
 
Revenue for the December 2009 quarter of $729.6 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on October 27, 2009 of $720.0 million and increased 8.2% from the September 2009 quarter and 9.4% from the prior December quarter. The increase in local currency was 5.5% sequentially and 4.6% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $777.9 million, an increase of 7.4% from the September 2009 quarter and 38.4% from the prior year. Positive book-to-bill ratios were reported in all primary markets.
Net income for the December 2009 quarter was $19.3 million or $0.11 per share, compared with a net loss of $11.6 million or $0.07 per share, for the September 2009 quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.6%, reflecting the tax cost of a planned repatriation of dividends from certain non-US subsidiaries in fiscal 2010.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the December 2009 quarter was $41.4 million or $0.24 per share, compared with net income of $31.7 million or $0.18 per share, in the September 2009 quarter. This result exceeded the upper end of the guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.22 per share. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded a pretax restructuring charge of $25.6 million ($22.1 million after-tax or $0.13 per share).
 
"For the third consecutive quarter we saw sequential gains in sales and incoming orders," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue was well above our prior guidance and we had a 1.07 book-to-bill ratio. Margins improved due to higher revenue, cost containment and the favorable impact of restructuring. Looking forward to our third fiscal quarter, we expect to see a smaller than normal seasonal slow down over the Chinese New Year period, returning to normal seasonal patterns thereafter. Longer term, our strong presence in Asia coupled with continued demand for new consumer electronic devices and pent up demand for information technology products should provide us with opportunities for sustained growth."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2009:
Six-Month Results
Revenue for the six-months ended December 31, 2009 was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 6.8% compared with the prior fiscal year. The decrease in local currency was 8.5%. Net income of $7.7 million or $0.04 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $81.5 million ($60.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.35 per share), and a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share.
Restructuring Update
The Company now estimates a total pretax charge through the end of fiscal year 2010 of approximately $300 million, compared with a previous estimate of $280 million. The increase is due to additional non-cash impairments for buildings resulting from continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets and additional specific actions that have been initiated as we approach the end of our restructuring program. As a result, the expected cost savings from the restructuring program has increased by $5 million to approximately $205 million on an annual basis.
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $715 to $735 million for the March 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.18 to $0.22, assuming an effective tax rate of 30.0%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $10.0 million or $0.04 per share after-tax.
