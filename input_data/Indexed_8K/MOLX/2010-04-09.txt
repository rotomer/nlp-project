Lisle, Ill., USA  April 9, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, has learned that an individual working in Molex Japan's finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders in Molex Japan's name which we believe to be in the range of $175 million and to have been used to trade on margin in unauthorized accounts in Molex Japan's name. We also believe that the individual has misappropriated cash from Molex Japan which resulted in a loss in the range of $15 million. The individual has admitted to forging documentation in arranging the transactions. We have retained outside legal counsel, and they are retaining forensic accountants, to investigate the matter and the extent of our liability, if any, for the unauthorized loans.
