Lisle, Ill., USA  April 27, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
Revenue for the March 2010 quarter of $756.3 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on January 26, 2010 of $735 million and increased 3.7% from the December 2009 quarter and 49.6% from the March 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 4.9% sequentially and 45.5% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $838 million, an increase of 7.7% from the December 2009 quarter and 76.6% from the prior year quarter.
Net income for the March 2010 quarter was $23.8 million or $0.14 per share, compared with net income of $19.3 million or $0.11 per share, for the December 2009 quarter. For the March 2010 quarter, net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $9.0 million ($7.4 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) and a pretax loss of $31.0 million ($19.8 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Molex Japan. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the March 2010 quarter was $51.0 million or $0.29 per share, compared with net income of $41.4 million or $0.24 per share, in the December 2009 quarter. This result exceeded the upper end of the guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 per share. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded the restructuring charge and loss for unauthorized activities in Molex Japan previously mentioned.
 
"Business conditions in our key markets continue to improve, resulting in strong operating leverage due to our new, post-restructuring cost structure," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue benefitted from a broad based recovery in all end markets and geographies with particular strength in the Industrial market, continued growth in the Automotive market as well as better than seasonal performance in the Data and Consumer markets. We are optimistic that the recovery will continue as global economic conditions improve and as our customers introduce new products. Our operating margin, excluding special charges, was 10.5% for the quarter. With further restructuring savings to be realized and revenue growth developing, we see a clear path to achieving our target operating margin of 14%."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2010:
Nine-Month Results
Revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2010 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 7.4% compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2009. The increase in local currency was 5.1%. Net income of $31.5 million or $0.18 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $90.6 million ($67.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.39 per share), a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share and a pretax loss of $31.0 million ($19.8 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Molex Japan.
Unauthorized Activities in Molex Japan
In April 2010, Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary because it learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading activities in Molex Japan's name. This individual has admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. At this time, the total amount involved in this fraud scheme has been estimated to be approximately $193.2 million, of which Molex Japan has recognized a pretax loss in the March 2010 quarter of $31.0 million ($19.8 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) and disclosed a contingent liability of $162.2 million. The loss of $31.0 million is comprised of $20.2 million for misappropriated cash and $10.8 million for the repayment of an unauthorized loan subsequent to March 31, 2010. The contingent liability represents the current balance of unauthorized borrowings in Japan.
Restructuring Update
The Company expects to complete its restructuring program by June 2010 and estimates a total pretax charge for the entire program of approximately $300 million. The expected cost savings from the restructuring program is approximately $205 million on an annual basis.
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $810 to $830 million for the June 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.30 to $0.34, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $11.5 million or $0.06 per share after-tax. These estimates exclude any additional losses related to, or costs of the investigation into, unauthorized activities in Molex Japan.

Editor's note:
 
Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We refer to non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to describe earnings and earnings per share excluding the items referenced above. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share provide useful information to investors because both provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share may be different from similar measures used by other companies.
