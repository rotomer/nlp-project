Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
.
     On August 3, 2010, Molex Incorporated issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2010. A web cast to discuss earnings and current market conditions will be held on August 3, 2010. A copy of the press release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and a copy of the slides to be presented at the web cast is being furnished as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
     The information furnished under Item 2.02 and Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
.
     (a) As more fully set forth below, management of Molex Incorporated, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and Molex's independent accountants met on August 2, 2010 to consider the accounting for the unauthorized activities in Japan and errors in tax related accounts in prior periods. After due consideration, management and the Audit Committee concluded that the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements and the 2010 quarterly reports should be restated. Accordingly, the financial statements filed by us relating to those periods should not be relied upon. We will file 2010 consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K subsequent to this report on August 3, 2010 containing the restated periods to supersede those earlier filings.
     As we previously reported, in April 2010, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in Japan. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japan's finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japan's name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japan's name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japan's accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation is now substantially complete. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
     At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported the outstanding unauthorized loans as a contingent liability of $162.2 million. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an accrued liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters. In particular, we recorded cumulative net losses of $201.9 million, ($128.7 million after-tax) due to these unauthorized activities, which were comprised of (1) the asserted unauthorized loans outstanding as of June 30, 2010 of 15.0 billion ($169.7 million), (2) the payment of 1.0 billion ($10.8 million) of unauthorized loans on April 5, 2010, (3) misappropriated funds of 1.9 billion ($20.5 million), and (4) cumulative investigative costs through June 30, 2010 of $4.8 million, offset by (5) an unauthorized investment account with a balance of 0.4 billion ($3.9 million) as of June 30, 2010. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010, with approximately 15.4 billion ($167.4 million) occurring prior to June 30, 2007. The accrued liability for these potential net losses was 14.7 billion ($165.8 million) as of June 30, 2010.
     To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the outstanding unauthorized loans, we would recognize a gain in that amount.
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we made the following adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements.
     Based on our analysis of these adjustments, we concluded that while the adjustments were not material to the operating results of fiscal years 2008 or 2009, there was an overstatement of stockholders' equity in the amount of $101.3 million, which represented 4.9% of total stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2009. Accordingly, we are restating the fiscal 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements and restating fiscal 2010 quarterly results. The restated financial statements did not impact segment reporting.

Revenue for the June 2010 quarter of $847.3 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on April 27, 2010 and increased 12% from the March 2010 quarter and 48% from the June 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 13% compared with the March 2010 quarter and 46% compared with the prior year.

Net income for the June 2010 quarter was $39.8 million or $0.23 per share, compared with net income of $38.4 million or $0.22 per share, for the March 2010 quarter. For the June 2010 quarter, net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $26.5 million ($24.7 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) and a pretax loss of $4.8 million ($3.0 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Japan.

For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded charges for the restructuring program and losses related to unauthorized activities in Japan. The effective tax rate for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 27.0%.
 
"We achieved record bookings in the quarter and hit an all time high for revenue in the month of June," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Business activity in all of our major markets is quite strong and we expect to see further growth going forward, although at a slower pace. We ended the fiscal year with strong momentum. As expected, our restructuring program is now complete and we are seeing the benefits of our reorganization and improved cost structure through both top line growth and increased earnings power."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2010:
Full Year Results
Revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was $3.0 billion, an increase of 16.5% compared with the prior fiscal year. The increase in local currency was 14%. Net income of $76.9 million or $0.44 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $117.1 million ($92.8 million after-tax or approximately $0.53 per share), a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share and a pretax loss of $26.9 million ($17.1 million after-tax or $0.10 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Japan.

The effective tax rate for the fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis was 30.4%.
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary because it learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued liability of $165.8 million as of June 30, 2010 for the outstanding unauthorized loans pending the resolution of these matters, as more fully described below. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Restructuring Update
The Company completed the restructuring program during the June 2010 quarter. The total pretax cost of the program was $315 million which is $15 million higher than previously estimated due to additional non-cash asset impairments for redundant production capacity and further reductions in the carrying cost of real estate held for sale. The expected cost savings from the restructuring program is approximately $205 million on an annual basis. To date, we have realized annual savings of approximately $172 million with $33 million still to be realized in fiscal 2011.
 
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $850 to $880 million for the September 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.42 to $0.46, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.

Editor's note:
 
 
Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We refer to non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to describe earnings and earnings per share excluding the items referenced above. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share provide useful information to investors because both provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share may be different from similar measures used by other companies.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note A  Net Loss on Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As we previously reported, in April 2010, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in Japan. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japan's finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japan's name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japan's name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japan's accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation is now substantially complete. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported the outstanding unauthorized loans as a contingent liability of $162.2 million. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters. In particular, we recognized cumulative net losses of ($201.9 million, or $128.7 million after-tax) due to these unauthorized activities, which were comprised of (1) the asserted unauthorized loans outstanding as of June 30, 2010 of 15.0 billion ($169.7 million), (2) the payment of 1.0 billion ($10.8 million) of unauthorized loans on April 5, 2010, (3) misappropriated funds of 1.9 billion ($20.5 million), and (4) cumulative investigative costs through June 30, 2010 of $4.8 million, offset by (5) an unauthorized investment account with a balance of 0.4 billion ($3.9 million) as of June 30, 2010. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010, with approximately 15.4 billion ($167.4 million) occurring prior to June 30, 2007. The accrued liability for these potential net losses was 14.7 billion ($165.8 million) as of June 30, 2010. To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the outstanding unauthorized loans, we would recognize a gain in that amount.
Note B  Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we made the following adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements.
Based on our analysis of these adjustments, we concluded that while the adjustments were not material to the operating results of fiscal year 2009, there was an overstatement of stockholders' equity in the amount of $101.3 million, which represented 4.9% of total stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2009. Accordingly, we restated the fiscal 2009 consolidated financial statements and quarterly financial statements included in this release.
