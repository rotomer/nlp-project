Item 2.05
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
.
     On June 18, 2007, Molex Incorporated ("Molex") filed a current report on Form 8-K regarding its multi-year plan to implement restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve return on invested capital in connection with the new global organization launched on July 1, 2007. At that time, Molex was unable to make a determination of the estimated amount or ranges of amounts to be incurred for each major type of cost and the charges and future cash expenditures associated therewith. Molex is filing this Form 8-K/A to amend the June 18, 2007 Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein.
      The total pretax cost of the restructuring was $315 million. Molex completed the restructuring program during the fourth quarter of FY10.
     The restructuring and asset impairment costs related to the restructuring includes the following: $242 million for employee termination benefit costs; $8 million pension curtailment gain; and $81 million for manufacturing asset impairments or write-offs.
     The restructuring will result in total cash expenditures of approximately $242 million.
