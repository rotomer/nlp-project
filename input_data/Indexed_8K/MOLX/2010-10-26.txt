Lisle, Ill., USA  October 26, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 first quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Revenue for the September 2010 quarter of $897.7 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on August 3, 2010 and increased 6% from the June 2010 quarter and 33% from the September 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 5% compared with the June 2010 quarter and 32% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $868.4 million, a decrease of 5% from the June 2010 quarter but an increase of 20% from the prior year quarter.
Net income for the September 2010 quarter was $75.1 million or $0.43 per share, compared with net income of $39.8 million or $0.23 per share, for the June 2010 quarter. Net income for the current quarter was impacted by investigative and legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $5.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or $0.02 per share). In the June 2010 quarter, net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $26.5 million ($24.7 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) and investigative and legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $4.8 million ($3.0 million after-tax or $0.02 per share). The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 32.2%, which included a charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share for the reversal of estimated tax benefits resulting from the expiration of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock at amounts less than recorded book value.
"Revenue and earnings per share reached all-time record levels in the September quarter and customer demand continued to be strong," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Our growth has been further supported by new product launches and by our Focus Account program that continues to expand and diversify our customer base, bringing us new opportunities for growth. We have now exceeded pre-recession revenue and order levels and are seeing the benefits of our new cost structure. In view of the record revenue and profits along with a more efficient organization resulting from the restructuring, we are increasing our dividend by 14.8% effective with the payment in January, 2011."
 
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2010:
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary after it was learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. The Company retained outside legal counsel and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter and that investigation has now been completed. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex. On October 13, 2010, Molex filed a written answer requesting the court to dismiss the complaint. The Company intends to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment from Molex.
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.175 per share, an increase of 14.8% from the previous cash dividend of $0.1525 per share. The increase is effective for the cash dividend payable on January 25, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010, for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board.
Outlook
The Company has considered the modest slowing of orders in the current quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global electronics market in setting its guidance for the coming quarter. In consideration of these factors and assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $850 to $890 million for the December 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.38 to $0.44, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.
