Lisle, Ill., USA  January 25, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 second quarter ended December 31, 2010.
Revenue for the December 2010 quarter of $901.5 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on October 26, 2010, increased 24% from the December 2009 quarter and was incrementally higher than the September 2010 quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 22% compared with the prior year but decreased 2% compared with the September 2010 quarter. Orders for the quarter were $872 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year quarter and in line with the September 2010 quarter.
Net income for the December 2010 quarter was $78.3 million or $0.45 per share, exceeding the high end of guidance, compared with net income of $13.8 million, or $0.08 per share, for the December 2009 quarter and $75.1 million, or $0.43 per share, for the September 2010 quarter. Net income for the current quarter was impacted by legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share). In the December 2009 quarter, net income included restructuring costs of $25.6 million ($22.2 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) and costs from unauthorized activities in Japan of $8.5 million ($5.4 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). In the September 2010 quarter, net income included legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $5.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or $0.02 per share). The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 30.3%.
"Fiscal 2011 is off to a strong start with successive quarters of revenue and earnings per share records," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "We expect our expanded and more diversified customer base, coupled with our robust new product pipeline, to position us for a strong second half to our fiscal year. In addition to these organic growth opportunities, in January we announced the purchase of Luxtera's active optical cable business which will give us a more complete offering in our high speed cable business and offer us considerable growth potential both now and for next generation technology. With our new, low cost platform, a strong balance sheet, our extensive presence in Asia and significant growth opportunities in the expanding global electronics market, we believe we are well positioned for the future."
 
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2010:
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary after it was learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. The Company retained outside legal counsel and they retained forensic accountants to investigate the matter and that investigation has now been completed. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex Japan. Molex Japan intends to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Outlook
The Company has considered the seasonal trends and the continued uncertainty in the global electronics market in setting its guidance for the coming quarter. In consideration of these factors and assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $850 to $890 million for the March 2011 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.39 to $0.43 assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.
