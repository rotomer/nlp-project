EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  May 3, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 third quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Revenue for the March 2011 quarter of $874.5 million increased 16% from the March 2010 quarter and declined 3% from the December 2010 quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 13% compared with the prior year quarter and declined 4% compared with the December 2010 quarter. Orders for the quarter were $880 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter and 1% from the December 2010 quarter.
Net income for the March 2011 quarter was $68.1 million or $0.39 per share, compared with net income of $38.4 million, or $0.22 per share, for the March 2010 quarter and $78.3 million, or $0.45 per share, for the December 2010 quarter. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 30.4%. These periods include costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan as outlined below in our update on this matter. The March 2010 quarter also included restructuring costs of $9.1 million ($7.4 million after-tax or $0.04 per share).
 
"We were fortunate that the recent natural disasters in Japan had only a minor impact on Molex this quarter. Our employees are safe and our facilities are operational," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Financial results for the March quarter were generally in line with our guidance and expectations; however, we do expect additional impact on our results in the June quarter due to supply chain disruptions in Japan. Fortunately, we have significant new product introductions and strong new orders outside of Japan which will help to mitigate this situation."
"The rate of expansion of mobile computing, investments in data and communication infrastructure and growth of the middle class in emerging markets continues to accelerate, driving increased demand for our many products. Our new organization structure, Focus Account program and portfolio management initiatives position Molex to benefit from these strong trends."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2011:
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary after it was learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. The Company retained outside legal counsel and they retained forensic accountants to investigate the matter and that investigation has been completed. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex Japan. Molex Japan intends to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Net income for the March 2011, December 2010 and March 2010 quarters were impacted by costs related to the unauthorized activities in Japan of $2.9 million ($1.8 million after-tax or $0.01 per share), $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share), and $8.0 million ($5.1 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), respectively.
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share, an increase of 14.3% from the previous cash dividend of $0.175 per share. The increase is effective for the cash dividend payable on July 25, 2011 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2011, for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board.
 
Outlook
The Company has considered the estimated impact on revenue and earnings from the natural disasters in Japan in setting its guidance for the coming quarter. In consideration of these factors and assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $900 to $930 million for the June 2011 quarter, even after a reduction of approximately $20 million due to supply chain disruptions in Japan. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.42 to $0.48 assuming an effective tax rate of 30%. In addition, the guidance assumes unusual costs due to the events in Japan including freight, production inefficiencies and asset related charges totaling $3 to $4 million.
