For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  August 3, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fourth quarter and its full fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.
Full Year Results
Revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 19.3% compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies increased 16.5%. Net income for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was $298.8 million or $1.70 per share, compared with net income of $76.9 million or $0.44 per share in the prior fiscal year. Prior year net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $117.1 million ($92.8 million after-tax or $0.53 per share), and a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share. These periods also include costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan as outlined below in our update on this matter. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was 30.5%.
 
"Looking back, we are very pleased with our performance both for the current quarter and for the full year. We set annual records for revenue and profitability in a very difficult operating environment. Surging commodity costs, rapid increases in customer requirements and the natural disaster in Japan presented significant obstacles which we were able to overcome," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "As a result, we were able to increase our dividend twice during the fiscal year."
"Looking forward, the long term factors driving our business  increased mobility for consumer electronics, renewed enterprise spending, and a growing middle class in emerging economies  remain intact providing ample opportunities for growth. And, we have the right structure and people in place to take advantage of these opportunities and further grow both revenue and profit."
Fourth Quarter Results
Revenue for the June 2011 quarter of $913.7 million increased 7.8% from the June 2010 quarter and 4.5% from the March 2011 quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 2.5% compared with the prior year quarter and 2.9% compared with the March 2011 quarter. Orders for the quarter were $906 million, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter and an increase of 2.9% from the March 2011 quarter.
Net income for the June 2011 quarter was $77.3 million or $0.44 per share, compared with net income of $39.8 million, or $0.23 per share, for the June 2010 quarter and $68.1 million, or $0.39 per share, for the March 2011 quarter. All periods include costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan as outlined below in our update on this matter. The June 2010 quarter also included pretax restructuring costs of $26.5 million ($24.7 million after-tax or $0.14 per share).
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2011:
 
Molex Japan Litigation
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex learned that an individual had entered into unauthorized trading and obtained unauthorized loans in Molex Japan's name. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex Japan. Molex Japan is contesting the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Net income for the June 2011, March 2011 and June 2010 quarters was impacted by costs related to the unauthorized activities in Japan of $3.4 million ($2.1 million after-tax or $0.01 per share), $2.9 million ($1.8 million after-tax or $0.01 per share), and $4.8 million ($3.0 million after-tax or $0.02 per share), respectively.
Net income for the full fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010 included costs related to this matter of $14.5 million ($9.2 million after-tax or $0.05 per share) and $26.9 million ($17.1 million after-tax or $0.10 per share), respectively.
Outlook
Assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $880 to $920 million for the September 2011 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.39 to $0.45 assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.
