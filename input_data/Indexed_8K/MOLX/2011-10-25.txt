For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  October 25, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its first quarter ended September 30, 2011.
 
Revenue for the September 2011 quarter was $936.0 million, an increase of 2.4% from the June 2011 quarter and an increase of 4.3% from the September 2010 quarter. This is a record for the Company and above the high end of the guidance provided on August 3, 2011. Revenue in local currencies increased 1.2% from the June 2011 quarter and declined 1.6% from the September 2010 quarter. Net income for the September 2011 quarter was $80.5 million or $0.46 per share, compared with net income of $77.3 million or $0.44 per share for the June 2011 quarter and net income of $75.1 million or $0.43 per share for the September 2010 quarter.
"Molex had another strong quarter, once again setting records for revenue and earnings per share. Production in Japan increased during the quarter as our operations recovered from the earthquake and tsunami and as our customers pushed to prepare for the Christmas selling season," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "We successfully converted the higher revenue to income, which allowed us to expand our margins and exceed our guidance for the September quarter."
"While near term demand for our products is impacted by economic uncertainty, we remain confident that the long term trends of increased mobility, growth in emerging markets and a hardware replacement cycle will continue to drive the industry forward. With our global footprint, innovative design capabilities and improved cost structure, we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities."

Outlook
At the current time, the global economic environment is very difficult to interpret and this uncertainty as well as our recent incoming order trend has been reflected in the Company's outlook for the coming quarter. The Company estimates revenue in a range of $870 to $910 million for the December 2011 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.37 to $0.43 assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices and an effective tax rate in the range of 30% to 32%.
