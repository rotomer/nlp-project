For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  January 25, 2012  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its second quarter ended December 31, 2011.
 
Revenue for the December 2011 quarter was $857.6 million, down 8.4% from the September 2011 quarter and 4.9% from the December 2010 quarter. The impact of the floods in Thailand reduced revenue in the December quarter by approximately $15 million. Revenue in local currencies declined 7.8% from the September 2011 quarter and 6.6% from the December 2010 quarter. Net income for the December 2011 quarter was $64.0 million or $0.36 per share, compared with net income of $80.5 million or $0.46 per share for the September 2011 quarter and net income of $78.3 million or $0.45 per share for the December 2010 quarter. In the December 2011 quarter, we recorded a one-time charge for additional income tax expense of $2.7 million ($0.02 per share). This charge reflects the cumulative effect of a reduction in future tax benefits from deferred tax assets in Japan resulting from a decrease in the Japanese statutory corporate tax rate enacted in November 2011.
"We continue to be optimistic about the future as our new product pipeline is quite strong and long-term growth opportunities remain healthy," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "The uncertain economic environment coupled with the disruption from the floods in Thailand, however, made the December quarter challenging from a booking and revenue perspective. We are pleased with our cost control, cash flow and resulting margins and are encouraged by improvements in recent booking trends. During the quarter we completed the purchase of Temp-Flex Cable, Inc., a specialty wire and cable company. Temp-Flex increases our presence in the medical market and will complement our high performance cable business."

At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.32 to $0.36 assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices and an effective tax rate of 32%.
