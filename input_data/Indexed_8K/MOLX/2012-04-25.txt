For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  April 25, 2012  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its third quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
Revenue for the March 2012 quarter was $837.1 million, down 2.4% from the December 2011 quarter and 4.3% from the March 2011 quarter. Revenue in local currencies declined 2.0% from the December 2011 quarter and 4.8% from the March 2011 quarter. Net income for the March 2012 quarter was $64.9 million or $0.36 per share, compared with net income of $64.0 million or $0.36 per share for the December 2011 quarter and net income of $68.1 million or $0.39 per share for the March 2011 quarter. Net income for the March 2012 quarter includes a net tax benefit of $3.0 million ($0.02 per share) resulting from the release of net operating loss valuation allowances no longer required, partially offset by adjustments to deferred tax assets due to changes in applicable tax rates in certain jurisdictions.
"Business conditions stabilized during the March quarter, with order rates improving each month and the book-to-bill ratio increasing to 1.04. Costs remain under control and are being rigorously monitored," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "The long term themes driving the businessmobility, IT spending and growth in emerging markets - continue to develop, affording Molex significant opportunities for long-term growth. In addition, cash flow has been very strong, exceeding net income for each of the last three quarters. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has approved an increase to the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share."
