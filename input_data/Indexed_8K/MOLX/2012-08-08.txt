For Immediate Release
Lisle, Illinois  August 8, 2012  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.
Fourth Quarter Results
 
Net revenue for the June 2012 quarter was $858.5 million, a 2.6% increase from the March 2012 quarter and 6.0% decrease from the June 2011 quarter. In local currencies, net revenue increased 3.3% compared with the March 2012 quarter and decreased 4.4% compared with the June 2011 quarter. Orders for the June 2012 quarter were $901.0 million, an increase of 3.3% from the March 2012 quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 to 1.0 for the June 2012 quarter.
Net income for the June 2012 quarter was $72.0 million or $0.40 per share, compared with $64.9 million, or $0.36 per share, for the March 2012 quarter and $77.3 million, or $0.44 per share, for the June 2011 quarter.
"We are encouraged with our margin performance in the June quarter even though revenue was below our expectations. More importantly, bookings have now increased sequentially in Q3 and Q4 and new product design activity remains extremely strong," commented Martin P. Slark, Chief Executive Officer. "At this time of global economic uncertainty, we have several new product introductions scheduled for the September quarter that, coupled with the pre-Christmas build, are expected to drive revenue growth at a rate in excess of the connector industry."

Full Fiscal Year Results
 
Net revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was $3.5 billion, a 2.7% decrease from the prior fiscal year. Net revenue in local currencies decreased 4.3% from the prior fiscal year. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2012 was $281.4 million or $1.59 per share, compared with net income of $298.8 million or $1.70 per share in the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was 29.7%.
"Despite the challenging economic environment, we are pleased with our overall operating performance during fiscal 2012. We worked hard to overcome disruptions from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand. We were also very successful in fulfilling customer requirements in a record setting first quarter, which was followed by a significant slowdown in overall demand in the second quarter," commented Martin P. Slark. "For the full year we increased our gross margin while significantly improving our quality and delivery metrics, introduced many new products and generated record cash flow which allowed us to increase our dividend by 10%."
Outlook
Based upon current order rates, customer backlog and scheduled new product launches, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $900 to $940 million for the September 2012 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.37 to $0.41 assuming constant foreign currency rates, unchanged commodity prices and an effective tax rate in the range of 30% to 32%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In Molex Incorporated's ("Molex" or the "Company") conference call on August 8, 2012 regarding the Company's financial results for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and the following slides, Molex may refer to non-GAAP financial measures to describe earnings for such periods excluding the items referenced in the relevant slides used during this conference call. This is in addition to disclosing the most directly comparable measure for such periods determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Molex believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business and provide for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the relevant slides reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures intended to be used in the conference call to the most comparable GAAP measure. Page 2
