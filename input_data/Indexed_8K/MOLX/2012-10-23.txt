Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Molex Incorporated's ("Molex" or the "Company") conference call on October 23, 2012 regarding the Company's financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012 and the following slides, Molex may refer to non- GAAP financial measures to describe earnings for such periods excluding the items referenced in the relevant slides used during this conference call. This is in addition to disclosing the most directly comparable measure for such periods determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Molex believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business and provide for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the relevant slides reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures intended to be used in the conference call to the most comparable GAAP measure. Page 2
