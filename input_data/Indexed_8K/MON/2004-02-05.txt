ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. In July 2003, Monsanto's board of directors changed Monsanto's fiscal year end from Dec. 31 to Aug. 31. Monsanto has previously reported results for the eight-month "transition" period ended Aug. 31, 2003. On February 4, 2004, Monsanto Company issued a press release announcing selected financial information for the eight-month transition period as well as the four-months ended Dec. 31, 2003. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99, and incorporated herein by reference. The press release uses the non-GAAP financial measure of "free cash flow". We define "free cash flow" as the total of net cash provided or required by operations and provided or required by investing activities. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. This cash can be used for business needs and obligations, to reinvest into the company for future growth, or returned to our shareowners through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow is also one of the performance measures management uses in determining incentive compensation. The presentation of free cash flow is intended to supplement investors' understanding of our operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Furthermore, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to replace cash flows as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to "Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, unless we specifically incorporate it by reference in a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, we make no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibits. Certain statements contained in this report, including the information contained in the Exhibit, such as statements concerning our anticipated financial results, current and future product performance, regulatory approvals, currency impact, business and financial plans and other non-historical facts are "forward-looking statements." These statements are based on current expectations and currently available information. However, since these statements are based on factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from those described or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, among others: our exposure to various contingencies, including those related to Solutia Inc., litigation, intellectual property, regulatory compliance (including seed quality), environmental contamination and antitrust; fluctuations in exchange rates and other developments related to foreign currencies and economies; increased generic and branded competition for our Roundup herbicide; the accuracy of our estimates and projections, for example, those with respect to product returns and grower use of our products and related distribution inventory levels; the effect of weather conditions and commodity markets on the agriculture business; the success of our research and development activities and the speed with which regulatory authorizations and product launches may be achieved; domestic and foreign social, legal and political developments, especially those relating to agricultural products developed through biotechnology; our ability to continue to manage our costs; our ability to successfully market new and existing products in new and existing domestic and international markets; our ability to obtain payment for the products that we sell; our ability to achieve and maintain protection for our intellectual property; the effects of our accounting policies and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; our ability to fund our short-term financing needs; general economic and business conditions; political and 2
economic conditions due to threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; and other risks and factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are current only as of the date of this report. We disclaim any current intention to revise or update any forward-looking statements or any of the factors that may affect actual results, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99 [GRAPHIC OMITTED][GRAPHIC OMITTED] Monsanto Company 800 North Lindbergh Blvd St. Louis,Missouri 63167 Release Immediately Contact Media: Bryan Hurley (314-694-8387) Investors: Scarlett Lee Foster (314-694-8148) MONSANTO COMPANY REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PERIODS ENDED DEC. 31, 2003 AND 2002 ST. LOUIS (Feb. 4, 2004) - To fulfill the company's commitment to report its calendar-year results following its change to an Aug. 31 fiscal year end, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) today reported results for the 12 months of 2003. In July 2003, Monsanto's board of directors changed Monsanto's fiscal year end from Dec. 31 to Aug. 31. As a result, Monsanto reported results for its new fiscal year-end in October, including results from the eight-month "transition" period ended Aug. 31, 2003. The results reported today include the eight-month transition period as well as the four-months ended Dec. 31, 2003, that completes the company's results for the 12 calendar months of 2003. For comparability, the company also provided previously reported calendar-year 2002 results. The results for the eight-month transition period in 2003 and the 12 months of 2002 have not been restated to reflect discontinued operations recorded in the final four months of 2003. The restatements would not be expected to have a material impact on the results. As the company provides future earnings reports, Monsanto will restate the results for fiscal-year 2003, calendar years 2001 and 2002, and the transition period. Based on these results, Monsanto met or exceeded its guidance on the key financial targets - including earnings per share (EPS) on an ongoing basis in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 and free cash flow of approximately $200 million - established for calendar-year 2003. Net sales: Net sales for the four months ended Dec. 31, 2003, were $1,682 million and $3,373 million for the eight months ended Aug. 31, 2003. For the 12 months of 2002, Monsanto reported net sales of $4,673 million. Net sales for the four months ended Dec. 31, 2003, were $806 million for the Seeds and Genomics segment and $876 million for the Agricultural Productivity segment. For the eight months ended Aug. 31, 2003, net sales for the Seeds and Genomics segment were $1,165 million and $2,208 million for the Agricultural Productivity segment. For the 12 months of 2002, Monsanto reported net sales of $1,585 for the Seeds and Genomics segment and $3,088 for the Agricultural Productivity segment. Sales performance improved primarily because of increased sales of Monsanto's seeds and traits and improvements in the sales of Roundup herbicide in Brazil. Combined, these sales improvements more than offset expected decreases in overall sales revenues associated with the company's U.S. Roundup herbicide business. -more-
-2- Net income and earnings per share results: Monsanto recorded net income of $34 million, or 13 cents per share, for the four months ended Dec. 31, 2003, and a net loss of $23 million, or a loss of 9 cents per share, for the eight months ended Aug. 31, 2003. This compares with a $1,693 million loss, or a loss of $6.45 per share, for 2002. EPS guidance on an as reported basis for calendar year 2003 had been expected to be in the range of a net loss of 13 cents to a net loss of 3 cents per share. Items affecting comparability for the four-month period ending Dec 31, 2003 include: o Net restructuring charges of $(0.09) per share. o A $(0.07) per share charge for discontinued operations and related restructuring. o Write-off of goodwill associated with the global wheat business of $(0.26) per share. Items affecting comparability for the eight-month period ending Aug 31, 2003 include: o Restructuring reversals of $0.02 per share. o Asset retirement charges of $(0.05) per share. o Monsanto's contribution to the settlement of litigation in Anniston, Alabama of $(0.96) per share. Items affecting comparability for 2002 calendar year include: o Net restructuring charges of $(0.31) per share. o Goodwill impairment charges of $(6.94) per share. o Establishment of Argentine bad-debt reserve of $(0.38) per share. o A gain of $0.08 per share related to certain asset sales. Cash flow: Free cash flow represents the total of cash flows from operations and investing activities for the 12 months of 2003. For the 12 months of 2003, net cash provided by operations was $521 million, compared with $1,108 million in calendar year 2002. Net cash required by investing activities was $238 million, compared with $469 million in 2002. As a result, free cash flow for the 12 months of 2003 was $283 million, compared with $639 million in 2002. In addition, net cash provided (required) by financing activities for the 12 months of 2003 was $182 million, compared with $(518) million in 2002. (For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1.) Comment from Monsanto Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant: "In 2003, we stressed focus and financial discipline. We set commitments that we believed were realistic and achievable, but that would also provide us a platform for growth in the mid-term. We delivered on those commitments. This is another milestone that underscores our ability as a company to deliver on our promises and to guide our company through our transition to a seeds-and-traits-based business." Monsanto Company is a leading global provider of technology-based solutions and agricultural products that improve farm productivity and food quality. -oOo- -more-

-9- Monsanto Company and Subsidiaries Selected Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Unaudited 1. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents the total of cash flows from operations and investing activities, as reflected in Monsanto's Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows presented in this release. The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to replace cash flows, and it is not a measure of financial performance as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The following table reconciles historical free cash flow to the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow: 2. Adjustment for New Accounting Standard No. 143: On Jan. 1, 2003, Monsanto adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting for and reporting of costs and obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. Upon adopting this standard, Monsanto recorded a pretax cumulative effect of accounting change of $19 million ($12 million aftertax, or $0.05 per share) effective Jan. 1, 2003. In addition to this noncash charge, property, plant and equipment was increased approximately $10 million, and asset retirement obligations were increased approximately $30 million. 3. Adjustment for New Accounting Standard No. 142: On Jan. 1, 2002, Monsanto adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only method and eliminated goodwill amortization. As a result of the transitional goodwill impairment test completed in 2002, goodwill was reduced by $2 billion and net deferred tax assets increased by $162 million as a result of the related tax effect. This resulted in a net loss and net reduction of $1.8 billion to shareowners' equity for the year 2002. 4. Restructuring: In October 2003, Monsanto announced plans to continue to reduce the costs associated with its agricultural chemistry business as that segment matures globally. The company will further concentrate its resources on its seeds and traits businesses. These plans include: (1) reducing costs associated with the company's Roundup herbicide business; (2) exiting the European breeding and seed business for wheat and barley; and (3) discontinuing the plant-made pharmaceuticals program. These actions will require charges up to $155 million aftertax in fiscal year 2004; $49 million of these charges were recorded in the four months ended Dec. 31, 2003. For the eight months ended Aug. 31, 2003, Monsanto reversed $8 million pretax ($5 million aftertax) of restructuring charges taken in prior years. The cost to carry out certain actions related to prior restructuring plans was less than originally anticipated. Restructuring items in 2003 and 2002 were primarily associated with the 2000 and 2002 plans related to facility rationalizations and work force reductions. -more-
-10- (a) For the four month period ended Dec. 31, 2003, restructuring charges were reduced by $2 million in restructuring reversals related to our past restructuring plans. The company recorded the reversals because it was able to carry out certain actions for less than originally anticipated. -oOo-
