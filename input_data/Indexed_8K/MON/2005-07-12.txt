Item 8.01      Other Events
Monsanto Company (the "Company") is considering conducting an exchange offer for up to $400 million of the $800 million of its outstanding 7-3/8% Senior Notes due August 15, 2012 (the "Notes"). Any such exchange offer would be made only to holders that have certified certain matters to the Company, including their status as "qualified institutional buyers" within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") or as to such other matters as the Company may require. The terms and conditions of any exchange offer and of the securities that would be issued have not yet been determined. However, the Company anticipates that notes to be issued under such an exchange would bear maturities longer than that of the Notes, and that the exchange, if consummated, would diversify the Company's debt maturity structure. The Company has made no final decision on whether to launch the exchange offer, or on the timing or the terms and conditions of any such offer.
Any securities offered in the contemplated exchange would not be registered under the Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
