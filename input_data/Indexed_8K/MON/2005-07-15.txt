The Securities and Designated Securities will be unconditionally and absolutely guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, Additional Amounts (as defined in the Indenture), if any, and interest (the "Guarantee").

Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities.

Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the Registration Statement, as defined below) the terms of such Designated Securities.

                 (a)    The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company and the Guarantor have elected to rely upon Rule 462(b) under the Act with respect to the Designated Securities, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the applicable Pricing Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction.
                (b)    Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Designated Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
                (c)    The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives the opinion of the General Counsel of the Guarantor and/or other counsel for the Company and the Guarantor satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
        Such counsel may also state that such counsel has not verified, and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, other than those mentioned in the last clause of subparagraph (viii) above, but such counsel shall confirm that such counsel has, however, participated in reviews and discussions in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statements, the Prospectus and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company and the Guarantor prior to the Time of Delivery, and that in the course of such reviews and discussions no facts came to such counsel's attention which led such counsel to believe (A) that the Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) or any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time the Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) or any post-effective amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) became effective or at the date of the applicable Pricing Agreement (and apart from any written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any omission therefrom), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time the Prospectus was issued, at the time any such amended or supplemented prospectus was issued or at the Time of Delivery, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any belief as to the financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or omitted therefrom or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated as reference to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
        In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel may rely upon opinions of local counsel (which may include counsel for the Representatives) satisfactory in form and scope to counsel for the Representatives.
                (d)    Special Canadian counsel to the Company satisfactory to the Representatives, shall have furnished to the Representatives such counsel's written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
                (d)    At the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type referred to in AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72 (or any successor standard thereto).
                (e)    Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock (other than changes in treasury stock within limits, or pursuant to employee plans, disclosed or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities) or long-term debt of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, including the Company, or any material change, or any development involving a prospective material change, in or affecting the financial position, shareowners' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Company, considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the
public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented in connection with the Designated Securities.
                (f)    On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's or Guarantor's debt securities by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
                (g)    On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following events, the effect of which on the financial markets in each case, in the judgment of the Representatives, is such as to make it impracticable or inadvisable for the Underwriters to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Designated Securities: (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by federal or New York State authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
                (h)    The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantor satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor herein at and as of such Time of Delivery and as to the performance by the Company and the Guarantor in all material respects of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, and the Company and the Guarantor also shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of officers of the Company and the Guarantor satisfactory to the Representatives as to the matters set forth in subsection (a) of this Section.
                (i)    The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses.
        8.    
Indemnification.
                (a)    The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which any such person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse (within a reasonable time after the same is incurred, and subject to a right to audit) each such indemnified person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or claim; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; provided, further, that if any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities contained any alleged untrue statement or allegedly omitted to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and such statement or omission shall have been corrected in a revised Preliminary Prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities or any amendment or supplement thereto relating to the Designated Securities, the Company and the Guarantor shall not be liable to any Underwriter under this subsection (a) with respect to such alleged untrue statement or alleged omission to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that such Underwriter sold Designated Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of a revised Preliminary Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference), the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), any other amended prospectus relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or any amendment or supplement thereto relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference), as the case may be, containing a correction of such alleged misstatement or omission, if the Company or the Guarantor have made available copies thereof to such Underwriter prior to the confirmation of such sale; and provided, further, that the Company and the Guarantor shall not be liable to any Underwriter under this subsection (a) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the use by such Underwriter of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented as it may be further amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), as the case may be (i) otherwise than in connection with an offer or sale of the Designated Securities or (ii) at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented unless the Company or the Guarantor have prior to such use amended or supplemented the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to comply with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act if required pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof and such Underwriter uses the Prospectus as amended or supplemented as so further amended or supplemented.
        Each Underwriter acknowledges that the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) does not extend to any liability which such Underwriter might have under Section 5(b) of the Act by reason of the fact that such Underwriter sold Designated Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or any amendment or supplement relating thereto (excluding documents incorporated by reference), as the case may be, if the Company or the Guarantor have made available copies thereof to such Underwriter.
        For purposes of this subsection (a) the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or any amendment or supplement relating thereto (excluding documents incorporated by reference), shall not be deemed to have been made available to an Underwriter until (x) such Underwriter has received the same or (y) such time after the receipt thereof by the Representatives as would permit the Representatives with reasonable diligence to deliver the same to such Underwriter.
                (b)    Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or the Guarantor
may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or the Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party that includes a statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act or any agreement or obligation (other than the requirement to make a monetary payment) by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
                (c)    Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, and in the event that such indemnified party shall not so notify the indemnifying party within 30 days following receipt of any such notice by such indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall have no further liability under such subsection to such indemnified party unless such indemnifying party shall have received other notice addressed and delivered in the manner provided in the second paragraph of Section 12 hereof of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof as provided above, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
                (d)    If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party against any of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto), then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the
relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omission which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
                (e)    The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and the Guarantor and to each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
        9.     (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriters the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Guarantor agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in
this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
                (b)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
                (c)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters made by the Representatives or the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
        10.     The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
        11.     If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company and the Guarantor shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company and the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
        12.     In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, electronic or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company or the
Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, electronic or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
        13.     This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each person who controls the Company, the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
        14.     Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
        15.     This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
        16.     (a) The Company irrevocably consents, agrees and submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the City of New York City in the State of New York, or if such court refuses to take jurisdiction, any state court located in the State of New York. The Company irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company agrees that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding upon it and may be enforced in the courts of Canada or any other court to the jurisdiction of which the Company is subject, by a suit upon judgment, provided that service of process is effected upon the Company in the manner specified in the following paragraph or as otherwise permitted by law.
                (b)    The Company hereby irrevocably designates, appoints, and empowers [APPOINTED AGENT], with offices currently at [ADDRESS], as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents that may be served in any action, suit or proceeding brought against the Company in any such United States federal or state court with respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Guarantee or any Securities and that may be made on such designee, appointee and agent in accordance with legal procedures prescribed for such courts. If for any reason such designee, appointee and agent hereunder shall cease to be available to act as such, the Company agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in the City of New York on the terms and for the purposes of this Section 16 reasonably satisfactory to each of the Representatives. The Company further hereby irrevocably consents and agrees to the service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents in any such action, suit or proceeding against the Company by serving a copy thereof upon the relevant agent for service of process referred to in this Section 16 (whether the appointment of such agent shall for any reason prove to be ineffective or such agent shall accept or acknowledge such service) or by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified air mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at its address specified in or designated pursuant to this Agreement, with a copy (similarly mailed) to [LIST APPOINTED AGENT] at [ ]. The Company agrees that the failure of any such designee, appointee and agent to give any notice of such service to it shall not impair or affect in any way the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of the holders of the Securities, the Underwriters and the other persons to serve any such legal process, summons, notices and documents in any other manner permitted by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Company or bring actions,
suits or proceedings against the Company in such other jurisdictions, and in such manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.
                (c)    The Company will, until the earlier of (i) the date three years from the date hereof and (ii) the date on which any litigation arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and which is pending at the date referred to in (i) above has been settled or is the subject of a final non-appealable judgment, have an authorized agent in the State of New York upon whom process may be serviced in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
                (d)    The provisions of this Section 16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part.
        17.     This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

        MONSANTO COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and in the Underwriting Agreement, dated July 12, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), to issue and sell to the Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters") the Securities specified in Schedule II hereto (the "Designated Securities").

Each reference to the Representatives herein and in the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement so incorporated by reference shall be deemed to refer to you.

        For value received, MONSANTO COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Guarantor," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture referred to in the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed and to the Trustee for itself and on behalf of the such Holder the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and any premium, and interest on, such Security, and any other amount due and payable in respect of such Security pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, repurchase, or otherwise, according to the terms of such Security and of the Indenture referred to therein. In case of the failure of Monsanto Finance Canada Co., an unlimited liability company duly organized and existing under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under such Indenture), immediately to make any such payment of principal, premium or interest on such other amounts, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made immediately when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company.
        The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely surety, and shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or such Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or such Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto, by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee, or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event or merger, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by strict and complete performance of the obligations contained in such Security and this Guarantee. The Guarantor hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal of, any premium or interest on, such Security, or other amount payable in respect thereof, legal proceedings may be instituted immediately by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Security, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, directly against the Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company.
        The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of such Security and the Trustee against the Company in respect of any amounts paid to such Holder by the Guarantor on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee or the Indenture; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, and any premium and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, all Securities issued under such Indenture shall have been paid in full.
        No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of this Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, of the due and punctual payment of principal of, any premium and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed.
        This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under such Indenture.
        All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in such Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.
        This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
        This Guarantee is an unsecured obligation of the Guarantor, and ranks with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor.
pari passu
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to be duly executed and dated as of the date of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed.

Monsanto Company 800 North Lindbergh Boulevard St. Louis, Missouri 63167
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-125193), which also constitutes Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-88542) (together, the "Registration Statement"), filed by the Company and Monsanto Finance Canada Co., a Nova Scotia unlimited company (the "Subsidiary"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 24, 2005 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to debt securities, common stock and other securities which may be issued from time to time by the Company and the Subsidiary, having an aggregate initial offering price of up to $2,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign currencies or composite currencies.
The Company now proposes to issue an aggregate of $250 million principal amount of its 5% Senior Notes due 2035 (the "Monsanto Notes") pursuant to the Registration Statement, which will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2002 (the "Monsanto Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor Trustee (the "Trustee"). In a concurrent offering pursuant to the Registration Statement, the Subsidiary now proposes to issue an aggregate of $150 million principal amount of its 5% Senior Notes due 2035 (the "Monsanto Canada Notes" and, together with the Monsanto Notes, the "Senior Notes") , which will be issued under an Indenture, to be dated as of July 1, 2005 (the "Monsanto Canada Indenture"), among the Subsidiary, the Company, as guarantor, and the Trustee, and which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
We are proving this opinion to you to supplement our prior opinion, dated May 24, 2005, which appears as Exhibit 5 to the Registration Statement.
Monsanto Company July 12, 2005 Page 2
To enable us to render the opinion set forth below, we have examined the Monsanto Indenture, the forms of the Monsanto Canada Indenture and the Senior Notes, corporate records of the Company and the Subsidiary, and such other documents and materials as we have considered relevant, and have made such investigation of matters of law and of fact as we have considered appropriate. Our opinions relating to Monsanto Canada and the Monsanto Canada Notes set forth below are given in reliance on the opinion of Stewart McKelvey Stirling Scales, Halifax, Nova Scotia, special Nova Scotia counsel to Monsanto Canada, a copy of which is attached hereto.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
        1.     The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has full corporate power to execute and deliver the Monsanto Notes.
        2.     Monsanto Canada is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Nova Scotia, and has full corporate power to execute and deliver the Monsanto Canada Notes.
        3.     The Monsanto Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. Upon compliance by the Company with the procedures specified in the Indenture relating thereto, the issuance of the Monsanto Notes will be duly authorized.
        4.     The execution and delivery of the Monsanto Canada Indenture by Monsanto Canada has been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the Subsidiary. Upon execution and delivery of the Monsanto Canada Indenture by the Subsidiary and by the Company, as guarantor, and compliance with the procedures specified in the Indenture relating thereto, the issuance of the Monsanto Canada Notes will be duly authorized.
        5.     When the Senior Notes have been so authorized and executed by the Company and the Subsidiary, as applicable, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered against payment therefor, the Monsanto Notes will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, and the Monsanto Canada Notes will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Subsidiary, and of the Company, as guarantor, enforceable against them in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally as in effect from time to time, and except that the availability of certain equitable remedies may be limited by generally applicable equitable principles.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and we consent to the use of our name in the Registration Statement and the related prospectus and prospectus supplements.

        (d)     We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution provided for in the Monsanto Indenture, the Monsanto Canada Indenture, the Senior Notes or other agreement which are violative of public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) or the legality of such rights.
