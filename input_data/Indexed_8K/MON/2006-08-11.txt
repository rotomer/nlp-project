ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
On Aug. 8, 2006, Monsanto Company's People and Compensation Committee approved the Monsanto Company Fiscal Year 2007 Annual Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan covers the performance period September 1, 2006 through August 31, 2007. Eligibility includes regular employees who do not participate in a local sales or manufacturing annual incentive plan. The 2007 Plan also excludes from eligibility all employees (Monsanto or Seminis) employed in the U.S. who are members of a collective bargaining unit with whom incentive compensation was the subject of good faith bargaining. Funding of the 2007 Plan is determined by the Company's attainment of certain financial goals related to sales growth (10% weighting), earnings per share (50% weighting) and cash flow (40% weighting) and the determination by the People and Compensation Committee that such attainment satisfies certain subjective performance criteria as determined by the Committee. Various performance levels are approved by the People and Compensation Committee with a payout level (as a percentage of target annual incentive opportunity) associated with each level of performance as follows: (i) threshold, 35%, (ii) budget, 100%, and (iii) outstanding, 200%. The incentive pool will be funded at no less than 20% of budget level funding in the event the Company pays dividends with respect to each of its financial quarters ending during the performance period.
 
A summary of the 2007 Plan can be found in Exhibit 10 filed herewith and is incorporated herein by reference.
