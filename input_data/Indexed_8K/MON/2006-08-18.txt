Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated due to the fact that the Merger has not been consummated on or before the Outside Date and certain other circumstances that are specified in the Merger Agreement then exist, including if at such time the Antitrust Condition has not been satisfied, then (i) Monsanto will be required to pay to Delta $600 million and (ii) upon making such payment, the Litigation will be terminated and extinguished in all respects.

In addition, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors of Delta (the "Delta Board") may, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to its stockholders, among other things, withdraw the approval of the Merger Agreement or recommend that its stockholders reject the Merger Agreement.  In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by Monsanto as a result of any such actions taken by the Delta Board, and if at the time of such action by the Delta Board, the Delta Board had not received a written proposal or written indication of interest (whether or not publicly announced) from a person with respect to an Acquisition Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement), then Delta will be required to pay Monsanto $15 million and the parties will thereafter be permitted to pursue any and all rights and remedies that they may have in respect of the Litigation.  The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by Delta or Monsanto for the other reasons set forth therein and the reason for such termination will determine whether the Litigation terminates or continues and whether any fees are payable in connection therewith.  For additional information with respect to the ability of the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement and the consequences of any such termination, including the impact any such termination would have on the Litigation, please refer to the Merger Agreement, including Article 9 thereof.

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of August 14, 2006, by and among MONSANTO COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), MONSANTO SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and DELTA AND PINE LAND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
RECITALS
WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of such corporations to effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to this Agreement;
WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company on the terms set forth in this Agreement, and the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously resolved to recommend that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including such merger, be approved and adopted by the stockholders of the Company;
WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, the Company and the other parties named therein are entering into several settlement agreements, dated as of the date hereof, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits A, B and C, respectively (collectively, the "Settlement Agreements"); and
WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
SECTION 1.01.      .
The Merger
(a)  At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.01(b) hereof), Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").  The Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Transaction."
1
 
(b)  On the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.03), the Company and Merger Sub will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Certificate of Merger") and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.  The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and any additional requirements of Delaware Law are complied with or at such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").
(c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.
SECTION 1.02.      .
Conversion of Shares
(a)  At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof or any other Person:
(i)            each share of common stock of the Company, $0.10 par value per share ("Company Common Stock"), and Series M Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock of the Company ("Series M Preferred Stock") held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Non-Converted Shares") shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;
(ii)           subject to Section 1.02(b) and Section 1.03, each share of Company Common Stock, and the associated preferred stock purchase right (the "Rights"), and each share of Series M Preferred Stock (collectively, the "Shares") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in clause (i) of this subsection, be converted into the right to receive $42.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").  As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.03 hereof; and
(iii)          each share of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.01 par value per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, $0.01 par value per share.
(b)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under Delaware Law, any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a stockholder (a "Dissenting Stockholder") who has neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in
2
writing appraisal for such Shares and otherwise properly perfected and not withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights (the "Dissenting Shares" and, together with the Non-Converted Shares, the "Excluded Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.  Such Dissenting Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof and will no longer be Dissenting Shares.  The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable law received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal.  The Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.  The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands.
SECTION 1.03.      .
Payment for Shares
(a)  As of the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company selected by Parent (which is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) as paying agent for the Merger (the "Paying Agent"), which shall provide that Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) contemplated by Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof (the "Payment Fund").  The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as provided in the immediately preceding sentence.  The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; , , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available).  Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be property of and payable to Parent, provided in the event of any losses due to the investment of the Payment Fund, Parent shall be required to deposit such additional amounts as may be required to ensure that the Payment
provided
however
 
3
Fund is sufficient to make any and all payments contemplated by Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof.
(b)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject to the terms of Section 1.03(g)) an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificate so surrendered, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1.  No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1.
(c)  After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.03.
(d)  Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
4
theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration.
(e)  Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.05 hereof)), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration due to such person pursuant to this Agreement in respect thereof.
(g)  The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Stock Options or Company Awards any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign law.  Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be timely paid to the applicable Governmental Entity and will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holders of Stock Options or Company Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
SECTION 1.04.      .  If after the date hereof and on or prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares or any other security by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, business combination, split-up, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall occur, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
Certain Adjustments

The holders of Company Awards will have no further rights in respect of any such Company Award from and after the Effective Time.
(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and will take such other actions as shall be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 1.05, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, including, without limitation, accelerating and causing the complete vesting, as of the Effective Time, of all Stock Options and Company Awards.

No event which constitutes a "reportable event" as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA which presents a material risk of the termination or partial termination of any such Plan or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  At any time in the past six years, no Plan and no plan maintained by an ERISA Affiliate that is subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated pursuant to Title IV of ERISA in connection with which any liability has been incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary which has not been satisfied in full.  Full payment has been made, or provision has been made therefor, of all material amounts which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries were required under the terms of the Plans or applicable law to have paid as contributions to such Plans on or prior to the date hereof and at any time during the past six years no Plan which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived.  Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transactions in connection with any Plan (or its related trust or funding vehicle) with respect to which the Company, any of the Subsidiaries, or any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries would be subject to either a penalty pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code nor, to the knowledge of the Company, will the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute such a transaction which penalty or tax would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has incurred any liability under the fiduciary provisions of ERISA, other than any liability that would not individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  At any time in the past six years, no claim, action or litigation has been made, commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan or its related trust or funding vehicle that would, if adversely determined, have (individually or in the aggregate) a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Company nor any entity under "common control" with the Company within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate") has participated in or contributed to any multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time during the past six years, and none of the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any "withdrawal liability" (as defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) at any time in the past six years that has not been satisfied in full.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries are not required to make available to Parent or its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives (i) any information that is subject to confidentiality obligations to another Person, which obligations do not permit disclosure to Parent or any such other Persons (ii) any information related to the Company's or a Subsidiary's relationship with any of the Persons listed in Section 5.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (including any contracts or agreements between any such Person, on the one hand, and the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, on the other hand) or (iii) any information that the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent agree (in good faith) constitutes competitively sensitive information, provided in the event that such Persons cannot so agree, such information shall be deemed competitively sensitive, and the Company shall not be required to provide access to (or cause to be provided access to) such information.
(b)  The Company will furnish reasonably promptly to Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no investigation made by Parent or its counsel, financial advisors, auditors or other authorized representatives, whether pursuant to this Section 5.03 or otherwise, shall affect any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall require any Person to disclose any information in violation of any applicable law, regulation or administrative order or decree and nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party of any existing contractual obligations with respect to the use and/or disclosure of such information.
(c)  All information provided by one party to the other pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" under the Confidentiality Agreement.
(d)  If, in connection with the performance by Parent and its Affiliates of their respective obligations under Section 7.07 hereof, including, without limitation, in the event that Parent determines to sell or otherwise dispose of the Company as contemplated by Section 7.07 hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective employees, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives to, provide all cooperation and assistance that is reasonably requested by Parent in connection therewith, including, without limitation, (i) subject to the terms of the last sentence of this Section 5.04(d), permitting the prospective buyer or buyers to conduct due diligence in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to have access to all of the offices, properties, business plans, books, files and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and any other information regarding the Company and its
32
Subsidiaries that any such prospective buyer or buyers may reasonably request and (ii) if applicable, in connection with the arrangement of any financing that any prospective buyer or buyer may seek in connection with the purchase of the Company, participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents.  The obligation of the Company to provide (or to cause to be provided) any information to any Person under this Section 5.03 shall be conditioned upon the entry by any such Person into an agreement with the Company similar to and no less favorable to the Company as the Confidentiality Agreement, and provided that the Company shall not be required to provide any such Person with any information the Company is not obligated to provide (or to cause to be provided) to Parent under Section 5.03, and provided further than any obligations of the Company under this Section 5.04(d) shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary.  Parent shall reimburse Company for all reasonable expenses related to the performance of the Company's obligations in this Section 5.03(d).
(e)  As part of its investigation pursuant to Section 5.03(a), following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent will continue to conduct due diligence with respect to the compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries (which term for purposes of this Section 5.03(e) shall include the Other Entities) with the FCPA, and the Company hereby agrees to fully cooperate with such efforts (and to cause its Subsidiaries and their respective employees, counsel and other representatives to fully cooperate with such efforts).  If Parent concludes that there is a possible violation of the FCPA by the Company or any Subsidiary, Parent will so inform the Company, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve each such violation and any issues related thereto, including by disclosing to the applicable Governmental Entity the existence or occurrence of any such violation if, in the opinion of the Company's outside counsel, such disclosure should be made.  In determining whether any non-compliance with the FCPA by the Company or any Subsidiary is material, or has caused a Material Adverse Change or Material Adverse Effect, the evaluation of such determination will be based solely on the effect of such non-compliance on the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall not be based upon the effect of such non-compliance on Parent and its Affiliates.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company's failure to resolve any violation or related issues in respect of the FCPA prior to the Closing Date shall not result in a breach of the terms set forth in this Section 5.03(e), it being understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not affect the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Closing, including, without limitation, the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 8.01(d) and 8.01(f) hereof.

SECTION 5.04.     
No Solicitation
(a)  The Company agrees that, prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not authorize or
33
permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, directly or indirectly, to solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any material Subsidiary or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or any material Subsidiary (an "Acquisition Transaction") or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any Person (other than Parent or its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives), or enter into any agreement, with respect to any Acquisition Transaction or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Company may, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, in response to a bona fide unsolicited written proposal or written expression of interest with respect to an Acquisition Transaction from a credible third party that is not subject to any material financing uncertainties and that the Company's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably result in a Superior Proposal, furnish or disclose non-public information to, and negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with, such third party, provided that the Company concurrently discloses any material non-public information to Parent as it is disclosing to such third party if such non-public information has not previously been disclosed to Parent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, in response to a bona fide unsolicited written proposal or written expression of interest with respect to an Acquisition Transaction from a credible third party that is not subject to any material financing uncertainties and that the Company's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent as contemplated by the immediately following proviso, constitutes a Superior Proposal, enter into a definitive agreement with a third party in respect of an Acquisition Transaction (provided that the Company shall concurrently with entering into such agreement terminate this Agreement with the consequences specified in Section 9.04(d) hereof); provided, however, that the Company shall only be permitted to enter into any such agreement (and terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 9.01(f) hereof in connection therewith) if: (i) the Company shall (x) have delivered written notice thereof to Parent, which written notice shall include the form of the agreement that is to be entered into with such third party or a written summary of all of the material provisions thereof and (y) have given Parent three business days after delivery of such written notice (together with the other documents required to be delivered in connection therewith) to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal); and (ii) at the end of such three business day period, the Company's Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, and after giving effect to all of the adjustments
34
which may be offered by Parent as contemplated hereby, if any, that such agreement with such third party constitutes a Superior Proposal.  As used herein, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written offer in respect of an Acquisition Transaction that the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger.
(b)  The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, to immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations existing on the date of this Agreement with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make a proposal in respect of an Acquisition Transaction.
(c)  After the date hereof, the Company shall reasonably promptly advise Parent in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries or proposals, and of its intention to enter into any agreement, relating to an Acquisition Transaction and any actions taken pursuant to Section 5.04(a) hereof and shall promptly furnish to Parent (and in any event within 24 hours following the receipt thereof) either a copy of such proposal or a written summary of all of the material terms of such proposal, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations in respect of any of the foregoing.

Exhibit 99.4
 
 
MONSANTO COMPANY TO ACQUIRE DELTA AND PINE LAND COMPANY FOR $1.5 BILLION IN CASH
ST. LOUIS and SCOTT, Mississippi (Aug. 15, 2006)  Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) and Delta and Pine Land Company (NYSE: DLP) announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement whereby Monsanto will acquire Delta and Pine Land Company for $1.5 billion in cash.  The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is subject to Delta and Pine Land shareowner approval, antitrust clearance, and customary closing conditions.
 "Delta and Pine Land represents an excellent fit for our company as we look to bring value-added traits and high-quality seed to cotton growers around the world," said Hugh Grant, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Monsanto.  "Delta and Pine Land has strong cotton genetics, and we believe Monsanto's leadership in providing the best cotton traits can improve on this already strong base."
Tom Jagodinski, president and chief executive officer of Delta and Pine Land, said, "Monsanto is a leading agricultural products company with a strong track record of growing and integrating diversified businesses.  Our companies are a natural fit that will provide a complete platform of cutting-edge seed technologies to our global farmer customer base for years to come."
Delta and Pine Land Company is a leader in the cotton seed industry and currently operates the largest and longest running private cotton seed breeding program in the world.  The company's extensive plant breeding programs, including its diverse base of international germplasm, has enabled the company to develop and deliver improved cotton varieties for their farmer customers for more than 90 years.
In recent years, Delta and Pine Land Company has worked to expand its breeding efforts through numerous facilities across the United States and around the world in an attempt to better serve its farmer customers.  Upon completion of the acquisition, management of both companies believe the proposed combination creates the opportunity to strengthen both the domestic and international cotton seed business by enhancing penetration of second-generation biotech trait offerings and continuing to invest in breeding to give cotton farmers who plant Delta and Pine Land's cotton seed varieties more choices.
Acquisition Details
Under the terms of the agreement, Delta and Pine Land shareowners will receive $42 per share in cash.  Monsanto intends to finance the acquisition with a combination of current cash on hand and a debt offering.  The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Monsanto's earnings per share (EPS) by the second year following closure of the acquisition, and Delta and Pine Land should be a contributor to operating cash in the first year.
The proposed acquisition requires review and approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice.  Because of the required regulatory approvals, no time frame for the closing of the transaction has been announced.  As part of the proposed agreement, Monsanto has committed to divest the U.S. assets of its Stoneville cottonseed business if required to close the transaction.
