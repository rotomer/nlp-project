Item 1.01.   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 28, 2007, Monsanto Company ("the Company") entered into a $2 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the "Five-Year Credit Agreement") with
certain lender parties thereto; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Citibank, N.A., as co-administrative agents; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as paying agent; ABN AMRO Bank N.V., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., Chicago Branch, Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank Plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, as co-documentation agents; and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as co-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.
Under the terms of the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the Company may obtain and utilize from time to time up to $2 billion in revolving credit loans and competitive bid advances for general corporate purposes,
which may include working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, refinancing and support of commercial paper borrowings. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Five-Year Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments may not exceed $2.2 billion. Borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement may be made in US Dollars or in Euros. Borrowings (other than competitive bid advances) bear interest at one of two rates as described in the Five-Year Credit Agreement. Up to $100 million of the total credit facility under the Five-Year Credit Agreement is available for the issuance of letters of credit in US Dollars. Additionally, up to $100 million of the total credit facility is available to the Company for swing line loans in US Dollars, available on a same-day basis.
There is a facility fee payable to each lender, which shall accrue at an applicable percentage per annum as described in the Five-Year Credit Agreement. There is also a utilization fee. Such fees, as well as the interest rate margin under the Five-Year Credit Agreement, are subject to adjustment based on changes in the Company's credit ratings The Five-Year Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limits on the incurrence of debt, the incurrence of liens, and mergers and consolidations. The Five-Year Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties. Breaches of the covenants, representations or warranties may be grounds for termination. Other events of default include the Company's failure to pay certain debt, the acceleration of certain debt, certain insolvency, bankruptcy or ERISA events, unpaid judgments over a specified amount, or a change in control as specified in the Five-Year Credit Agreement. The covenants, representations, warranties and other events of default are substantially similar to those in the Company's $1 billon five-year revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 4, 2004, which has been replaced with this Five-Year Credit Agreement.
The Five-Year Credit Agreement expires on February 28, 2012. Under circumstances specified in the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the Company may request up to two one year extensions of such termination date. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Five-Year Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Five-Year Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the agreement.
In addition to the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the Company maintains other commercial and investment banking relationships with the lenders and their affiliates.
A copy of the Five-Year Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. The description of the Five-Year Credit Agreement above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Five-Year Agreement.
Item 1.02.   Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
In connection with its entry into the Five-Year Credit Agreement described in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K, the Company terminated the $1 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of June 4, 2004 among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citibank, N.A.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. and Bank of America, N.A.; and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.

If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurocurrency Advance is specified in any such Notice, then the
 
 
 
17
 
applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

(c)
           
Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the relevant Borrower.

Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower that requested such Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount in the applicable currency. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and each Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the applicable currency together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) with respect to Dollar Advances, the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) with respect to Euro Advances, the rate per annum determined by the Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euros. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
(e)
           
The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be

The amount sufficient to compensate such Lender in light of such increase in capital maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender shall be determined by such Lender in good faith to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder. A certificate specifying the event referred to in this Section 2.14(b), the amount sufficient to compensate such Lender and the basis of its calculations (which shall be reasonable), submitted in good faith to the Parent Borrower and the Agent by such

Upon any Assuming Increasing Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.20, or any Assuming Extending Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.21, and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date or Extension Date, as the case may be, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to such Lender.

(d)
           
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Parent Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to
 
 
 
33
 
the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) in the case of amounts due in Dollars, the greater of (A) the Federal Funds Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of amounts due in Euros, the rate per annum determined by the Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euros.

"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)

This indemnification shall be made within 30 days (or, in the case of any such indemnification from a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, 60 days) from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
(d)
           
Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Parent Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf of the Parent Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of the Parent Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if the Parent Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, the Parent Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "

If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form;
provided
,
however
, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.
(f)

provided
that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completing, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
(g)
           
For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to comply with the requirements of Section 2.17(e) or (f) (
other
than
if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e) or (f) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.17(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure;
provided
,
however
, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrowers shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.
(h)
           
Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.17 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Increasing Lender
") and each other Eligible Assignee that agrees to participate in such requested Commitment Increase (each such Eligible Assignee, an "
Assuming Increasing Lender
") shall give written notice to the Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to participate in such Commitment Increase. If the Lenders and Assuming Increasing Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Lenders and such Assuming Increasing Lenders in such amounts as are agreed between the Parent Borrower and the Agent;

36
 
requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.20(b)) as of such Increase Date;
provided
,
however
, that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date:
(i)
            
(A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of each Borrower or the Executive Committee of each such Board approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Borrowers (which may be in-house counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent;
(ii)
          
an assumption agreement from each Assuming Increasing Lender, if any, in the form of Exhibit D hereto (each an "
Assumption Agreement
"), duly executed by such Eligible Assignee, the Agent and the Parent Borrower; and
(iii)
         
confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the Parent Borrower and the Agent.
On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.20(c), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Increasing Lender) and the Parent Borrower, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Increasing Lender on such date. If any Base Rate Advances are outstanding on the date of any Increase Date, the Agent shall give appropriate notice to the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Increasing Lenders to fund their respective pro rata shares of such outstanding Advances, and shall reallocate such Advances among the Lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, each Lender shall participate in each outstanding Base Rate Borrowing ratably according to their respective Commitments. If any Eurocurrency Rate Advances are outstanding on the date of any Increase Date, the Agent shall, on the last day of the applicable Interest Periods, give appropriate notice to the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Increasing Lenders to fund their respective pro rata shares of such outstanding Advances, and shall reallocate such Advances among the Lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, each Lender shall participate in such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing ratably according to their respective Commitments. If any Letters of Credit or Swing Line Advances are outstanding on any Increase Date, participations in such Extensions of Credit shall be deemed to be reallocated on such date according to the respective Commitments of the Lenders after giving effect to such increase.
SECTION 2.21.   . (a) The Parent Borrower, by written notice to the Agent, may, not more than twice during the term of this Agreement, request an extension of the Termination Date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration;
Extension of Termination Date
provided
that such request is made at least 30 days, but not more than 45 days prior to the first anniversary (or, in the case of the second such request, the second anniversary) of this Agreement (each such date, as appropriate, an "
Anniversary Date
"). The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not earlier than 30 days but not later than 20 days prior to the Anniversary Date, notify the Parent Borrower and the Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to such extension, such notice to be in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Agent and the Parent Borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Termination Date at least 20 days prior to the Anniversary Date, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender with respect to such request. The Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower in writing not later than 15 days prior to the Anniversary Date of the decision of the Lenders regarding the Parent Borrower's request for an extension of the Termination Date.
 
 
 
37
 
(b)

Extension Date
"), be extended for one year;
provided
that on each Extension Date, the applicable conditions set forth in Article III shall be satisfied. If fewer than all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.21, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, subject to Section 2.21(d) and effective as at the applicable Extension Date, be extended as to those Lenders that so consented (each a "
Consenting Lender
") but shall not be extended as to any other Lender (each a "
Non-Consenting Lender
"). To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.21 and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 2.21 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Parent Borrower, such Lender or any other Person;
provided
that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.14, 2.17 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive the Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Parent Borrower for any requested extension of the Termination Date.
(c)
           
If fewer than all of the Lenders consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.21, the Agent shall promptly so notify the Consenting Lenders, and each Consenting Lender may, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent not later than 10 days prior to the Anniversary Date of the amount of the Non-Consenting Lenders' Commitments for which it is willing to accept an assignment. If the Consenting Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to accept assignments of Commitments in an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the Commitments of the Non-Consenting Lenders, such Commitments shall be allocated among the Consenting Lenders willing to accept such assignments in such amounts as are agreed between the Parent Borrower and the Agent. If after giving effect to the assignments of Commitments described above there remain any Commitments of Non-Consenting Lenders, the Parent Borrower may arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible Assignees that agree to an extension of the Termination Date (each, an "
Assuming Extending Lender
") to assume, effective as of the Extension Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting Lender;
provided
,
however
, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Extending Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $10,000,000, in which case such Assuming Extending Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and
provided
further
that:
(i)
            
any such Consenting Lender or Assuming Extending Lender shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender

(B) any accrued but unpaid facility fees owing to such Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment;
(ii)
          
all additional costs, reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and
(iii)
         
with respect to any such Assuming Extending Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section 9.07(a) for such assignment shall have been paid by the Assuming Extending Lender;
 
 
 
38
 
provided
further
that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.14, 2.17 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least three Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Extending Lender, if any, shall have delivered to the Parent Borrower and the Agent an Assumption Agreement or an Assignment and Acceptance, as appropriate, duly executed by such Assuming Extending Lender, such Non-Consenting Lender, the Parent Borrower and the Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Parent Borrower and the Agent as to the increase in the amount of its Commitment and (C) each Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall have delivered to the Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender. Upon the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, each such Consenting Lender or Assuming Extending Lender, as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Lenders, and, except as otherwise provided above, the obligations of each such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.
(d)
           
If the Lenders having more than 50% of the Commitments (after giving effect to any assignments pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.21) consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an Assumption Agreement, an Assignment and Acceptance or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such Anniversary Date, the Agent shall so notify the Parent Borrower, and, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in subsection (b) of this Section 2.21, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "
Termination Date
" shall, with respect to each Consenting Lender and each Assuming Extending Lender for such Extension Date, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each Extension Date, the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Extending Lender) of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Consenting Lender and each such Assuming Extending Lender.
SECTION 2.22.   . (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances. Each Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances to such Borrower owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, such Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.

provided
,
however
, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement.
SECTION 2.23.   . (a) Subject to the consent of the Agent, the Parent Borrower may designate any Foreign Subsidiary of the Parent Borrower as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary, the Parent Borrower and the Agent and upon such delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement until the Parent Borrower shall have executed and delivered to the Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower at a time when any Foreign Borrower Obligations of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or any Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall be outstanding (which shall not have been cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Agent),

SECTION 8.04.   . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Parent Borrower hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parent Borrower irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any defense arising under any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of the Guaranteed Obligations, and any

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Parent Borrower waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Parent Borrower against any Obligated Party or any security.
SECTION 8.05.   . The Parent Borrower will not assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Obligated Party, or any collateral, until the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers have fully performed all their obligations to the Agents, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders.
Rights of Subrogation
SECTION 8.06.   . If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or otherwise, the Parent Borrower's obligations under this Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made and whether or not the Agents, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders are in possession of this Guaranty. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Parent Borrower forthwith on demand by the Agent.

SCHEDULE II -
MANDATORY COST FORMULA
 
1.
            
The Mandatory Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
 
2.
            
On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "
Mandatory Cost Rate
") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Mandatory Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Advance) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
 
3.
            
The Mandatory Cost Rate for any Lender lending from an Applicable Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all Advances made from that Applicable Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Applicable Lending Office.
 
4.
            
The Mandatory Cost Rate for any Lender lending from an Applicable Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:
 
 
Where:
 
A.
            
is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Lender to the Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in euros per 1,000,000.
 
5.
            
For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
            
"
Eligible Liabilities
" and "
Special Deposits
" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
 
(b)
            
"
Fees Rules
" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
 
 
 
 
(c)
            
"
Fee Tariffs
" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.I. Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fee rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate);
 
(d)
            
"
Reference Lender
" means ABN AMRO Bank N.V., London branch; and
 
(e)
            
"
Tariff Base
" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
 
6.
            
In application of the above formula, the resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
 
7.
            
If requested by the Agent or the Parent Borrower, the Reference Lender shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Agent and the Parent Borrower, the rate of charge payable by the Reference Lender to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by the Reference Lender as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to the Reference Lender for that financial year) and expressed in euros per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of the Reference Lender.
 
8.
            
Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Agent for the purpose of calculating its Mandatory Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender: the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office; and any other information that the Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
 
9.
            
The rates of charge of the Reference Lender for the purposes of A above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a lending office in the same jurisdiction as its Applicable Lending Office.
 
10.
          
The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in a Mandatory Cost Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender including the Reference Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
 
11.
   
The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Mandatory Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and the Reference Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
 
12.
          
Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, a Mandatory Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
13.
          
The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrowers and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties to this Agreement any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

MONSANTO ANNOUNCES $2 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY
 
ST. LOUIS (March 1, 2007)  Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with a group of banks to provide a new $2 billion credit facility. This agreement provides a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaces Monsanto's existing $1 billion credit facility established in 2004.
"The new credit facility broadens our global banking support, and provides us with improved flexibility and incremental financing capabilities," said Terry Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Monsanto.
As part of the announcement, Monsanto noted that this new credit facility would also provide additional options for financing its proposed acquisition of Delta and Pine Land Company (NYSE: DLP). This proposed acquisition is now being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
The bank syndication of the $2 billion facility was led by J.P.Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., as co-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.
