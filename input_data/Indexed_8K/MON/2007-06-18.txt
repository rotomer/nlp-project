ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
On June 15, 2007, Monsanto Company issued a press release updating its earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2007 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The press release furnished herewith uses the non-GAAP financial measure of earnings per share ("EPS") on an ongoing basis. Our ongoing EPS financial measure excludes certain after-tax items that we do not consider part of ongoing operations. Such items might include the effects of discontinued operations and divestitures, nonrecurring charges related to acquisitions, and charges related to restructuring. We believe that our ongoing EPS financial measure best reflects our ongoing performance and business operations during the periods presented and is more useful to investors for comparative purposes. In addition, management uses the ongoing EPS financial measure as a guide in its budgeting and long-range planning processes, and as a guide in determining incentive compensation. The presentation of EPS on an ongoing basis is intended to supplement investors' understanding of our operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
 
We are furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, unless we specifically incorporate it by reference in a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, we make no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.
 
 
 
The following exhibit is filed herewith:

MONSANTO INCREASES ONGOING EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL YEAR, PROVIDES INITIAL THIRD-QUARTER ESTIMATE
 
Company sets Webcast and Analyst/Media Call for 2007 Third-Quarter Financial Results
 
ST. LOUIS (June 15, 2007)  Based on the near completion of the U.S. planting season and following a preliminary review of Monsanto's third-quarter performance, the company announced today that it was increasing its fiscal year 2007 ongoing earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $1.75 to $1.80 per share, versus the prior guidance of $1.60 to $1.65 per share on an ongoing basis.
 
As a part of the increased expectations for the fiscal year, the company also reported that third-quarter results were expected to be approximately $1.00 per share on an ongoing and reported basis.
 
"We're having extraordinary performance in an extraordinary year for agriculture," said Hugh Grant, Monsanto chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The performance of our business has set us up for strong growth this year and continues to create momentum for future growth."
 
"Our leadership has come from our ability to deliver on our growth projections while maintaining our operational and financial discipline," said Grant.
 
The company noted that several factors are driving its results, including:
 
The company also noted that its full-year ongoing guidance includes an expectation that Delta and Pine Land Company's (D&PL) earnings will be moderately dilutive, as it historically has reported a loss in the fourth quarter. Monsanto also noted that its full-year guidance excludes the nonrecurring effect of the expected Stoneville and NexGen divestitures and the write-off of acquired in-process R&D associated with the acquisition of D&PL. These amounts are expected to be significant but cannot be estimated at this time, as the company is required to hold D&PL separate from the rest of its operations until the divestitures of Stoneville and NexGen are completed.
 
Webcast and Analyst/Media Call Set for 2007 Third-Quarter Financial Results
 
Monsanto will report its financial results for its fiscal year 2007 third quarter on Thursday, June 28, 2007, prior to market open.

The call will focus on the company's third-quarter results and future expectations. The call may also include a discussion of Monsanto's strategic initiatives, product performance and other matters related to the company's business.
