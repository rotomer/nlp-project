ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
On March 25, 2008, Monsanto Company issued a press release updating its earnings per share and free cash flow guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal year 2008. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The press release furnished herewith uses the non-GAAP financial measure of earnings per share ("EPS") on an ongoing basis. Our ongoing EPS financial measure excludes certain after-tax items that we do not consider part of ongoing operations. Such items might include the effects of discontinued operations and divestitures, nonrecurring charges related to acquisitions, and charges related to restructuring. We believe that our ongoing EPS financial measure best reflects our ongoing performance and business operations during the periods presented and is more useful to investors for comparative purposes. In addition, management uses the ongoing EPS financial measure as a guide in its budgeting and long-range planning processes, and as a guide in determining incentive compensation. The presentation of EPS on an ongoing basis is intended to supplement investors' understanding of our operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Information concerning Monsanto's use of the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow appears in Monsanto's most recent Report on Form 10-Q.
 
We are furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, unless we specifically incorporate it by reference in a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, we make no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.
 
 
 
The following exhibit is filed herewith:

MONSANTO BOOSTS FISCAL-YEAR 2008 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND FREE CASH FLOW GUIDANCE
 
Second-Quarter Results Exceed Expectations Given Upside from Seeds-and-Traits and Roundup Businesses
 
ST. LOUIS (March 25, 2008)  Leading corn market share positions, accelerated biotechnology trait penetration and new value generated by Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides have led Monsanto Company to well exceed its expectations for second-quarter results and to raise its full-year guidance for ongoing earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow.
 
The company now projects full-year ongoing EPS of $3.15 to $3.25, an increase versus the previous ongoing guidance of $2.70 to $2.80. For the second-quarter, the company expects ongoing EPS in the range of $1.75. As-reported EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.98 for the second quarter and in the range of $3.38 to $3.48 for the full year. Both periods will be affected favorably by $0.23 per share from the settlement of Monsanto's claims in conjunction with Solutia's emergence from bankruptcy. (For a reconciliation of ongoing EPS, see note 1).
 
The upside contribution from the company's seeds and traits business, together with the performance of its Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides business and the Solutia settlement, has translated to a stronger operating cash position. Given the increased level of operating cash, Monsanto now expects free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion for the fiscal year versus prior guidance of $900 million to $1 billion. The company expects net cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $2.45 billion, and net cash required by investing activities to be approximately $1.05 billion for fiscal year 2008. (For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1.)
 
"As we move closer to the Northern Hemisphere planting season, we've not only gained confidence in our 2008 opportunity, but also in our strategic path to 2012," said Hugh Grant, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Monsanto. "Our growth over the next five years will be built on our seeds-and-traits platform, and we've already exceeded a number of milestones that put us ahead of our plan to deliver consistent, sustainable growth."
 
"We are confident in our ability to deliver on our five-year growth commitments even with shifts in planted acreage or commodity-price movements because of the value farmers place on our technologies and the balance of our strategic platform," added Terry Crews, chief financial officer of Monsanto.
 
The company's stronger-than-expected performance through the first-half of the fiscal year reflects three factors, including:
 
 
 
 
 
As a result of the expected overall gross profit growth, Monsanto is expected to achieve its original target of reaching a 52-to-54 percent gross margin by 2010 two years ahead of schedule.
 
Crews indicated that the increase in operating cash will provide the company with increased resources to continue to use its strong cash position to benefit shareowners. Notably, Monsanto will continue to look for ways to invest in acquisitions that further growth, projects that support the current business' growth and dividend and share-repurchase programs that return value to shareowners.
 
Monsanto will release its second quarter earnings results on Wednesday, April 2, 2008, prior to market open. In conjunction with the announcement of its results, Monsanto will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. central time (9:30 a.m. eastern time) on that date.
 
The call will focus on the company's second quarter results and future expectations and may also include a discussion of Monsanto's strategic initiatives, product performance and other matters related to the company's business.
 
Presentation slides and a simultaneous audio webcast of the conference call may be accessed by visiting the investor section of the company's web site at http://www.monsanto.com/investors. Visitors may need to download Windows Media Player prior to listening to the webcast. Following the live broadcast, a replay of the webcast will be available on the Monsanto web site for three weeks.
