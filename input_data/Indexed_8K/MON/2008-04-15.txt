UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT
 
April 10, 2008
 
To the Representatives of the
several Underwriters named in the
respective Pricing Agreements
hereinafter described.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
From time to time Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a "Pricing Agreement"), substantially in the form of Schedule I attached hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities").
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2002, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture").
1.   
Pricing Agreements.
Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the Registration Statement, as defined below) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of electronic communications or other transmission method satisfactory to the Company and the Representatives. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
At or prior to the time when sales of the Designated Securities will be first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company will prepare the Time of Sale Information (as defined below) for such offering of Securities.
 
 
As used herein, the Time of Sale Information means (i) the Preliminary Prospectus (as defined below) used most recently prior to the Time of Sale, (ii) the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") in the form of Schedule IV to the Pricing Agreement, (iii) the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below), if any, identified in Schedule III to the Pricing Agreement, and (iv) any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package.
2.

Each subsidiary of the Company whose sales or total assets for the most recent fiscal year exceeded 5% of the consolidated sales or total assets, respectively, of the Company and its subsidiaries (each, a "Principal Subsidiary" and collectively, the "Principal Subsidiaries") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership and leasing of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests of each Principal Subsidiary of the Company has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and non-assessable and (except for shares necessary to qualify directors or to maintain any minimum number of shareholders required by law) is owned by the Company directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity except for such security interests, mortgages, pledges, liens, encumbrances, claims or equities that are immaterial to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

The Company and its subsidiaries have carried out evaluations of the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act.
(t)  The Company and its subsidiaries maintain systems of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act and have been designed by, or under the supervision of their respective principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including, but not limited to internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

(d)  To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c)), an earning statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including at the option of the Company Rule 158);
 
9
 
 
(e)  During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives or (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to such Designated Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives; and
(f)  If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b) with respect to the Designated Securities, the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act.
(g)  The Company will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Act.
(h)  The Company agrees that it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the applicable requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Act with respect to any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus to the same extent as if it were an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters;
(viii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
(ix)   The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and the information included in the Registration Statement in response to Item 10 (insofar as it relates to such counsel) of Form S-3 is to the best of such counsel's knowledge an accurate statement of the matter therein set forth and fairly presents the information called for with respect to that matter by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

(xi)   The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Such counsel may also state that such counsel has not verified, and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or the Time of Sale Information, other than those mentioned in the last clause of subparagraph (viii) above, but such counsel shall confirm that such counsel has, however, participated in reviews and discussions in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statements, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Time of Sale Information and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery, and that in the course of such reviews and discussions no facts came to such counsel's attention which led such counsel to believe (A) that the Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) or any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time the Registration Statement (including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) or any post-effective amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time the Prospectus was issued, at the time any such amended or supplemented prospectus was issued or at the Time of Delivery, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
 
13
 
 
under which they were made, not misleading or (C) that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any belief as to the financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (including any amendments or supplements thereto) and the Time of Sale Information or omitted therefrom or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated as reference to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel may rely upon opinions of local counsel (which may include counsel for the Representatives) satisfactory in form and scope to counsel for the Representatives.
(d)  At the date hereof and at the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type referred to in AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72 (or any successor standard thereto).
(e)  Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (including any amendments or supplements prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities) and the Time of Sale Information, there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock (other than changes in treasury stock within limits, or pursuant to employee plans, disclosed or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities and the Time of Sale Information) or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material change, or any development involving a prospective material change, in or affecting the business, financial position, shareowners' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities and the Time of Sale Information, the effect of which is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information.
(f)  On or after the earlier of (A) the Time of Sale and (B) the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Securities or any other debt securities or preferred stock of or guaranteed by the Company by Fitch Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
(g)  On or after the earlier of (A) the Time of Sale and (B) the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following events, the effect of which on the financial markets in each case, in the judgment of the Representatives, is such as to make it impracticable or inadvisable for the Underwriters to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Designated Securities in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus: (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii)  a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by federal or New York State authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; (iv) any calamity or
 
14
 
 
crisis within or without the United States affecting U.S. or international financial markets; or (v) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
(h)  The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery and as to the performance by the Company in all material respects of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, and the Company also shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the matters set forth in subsection (a) of this Section.
(i)  The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses.
(a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which any such person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any other prospectus relating to the Securities any Issuer free Writing prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse (within a reasonable time after the same is incurred, and subject to a right to audit) each such indemnified person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities.
Each Underwriter acknowledges that the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) does not extend to any liability which such Underwriter might have under Section 5(b) of the Act by reason of the fact that such Underwriter sold Designated Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or any amendment or supplement relating thereto (excluding documents incorporated by reference), as the case may be, if the Company has made available copies thereof to such Underwriter.
(b)  Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and
 
15
 
 
any other prospectus relating to the Securities, and Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
(c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, and in the event that such indemnified party shall not so notify the indemnifying party within 30 days following receipt of any such notice by such indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall have no further liability under such subsection to such indemnified party unless such indemnifying party shall have received other notice addressed and delivered in the manner provided in the second paragraph of Section 12 hereof of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof as provided above, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party against any of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto), then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omission which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as
 
16
 
 
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e)  The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9.   (a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriters the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.

(b)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters made by the Representatives or the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, electronic or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, electronic or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such
 
18
 
 
Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
14. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters named in the Pricing Agreement are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to any offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a fiduciary to, an agent of, or in a similar capacity with respect to, the Company or any other person. Additionally, no such Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and such Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by such Underwriters named in the Pricing Agreement of the Company, the transactions contemplated thereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and not on behalf of the Company.
15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Monsanto Company

St. Louis, Missouri 63167
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-125193), which also constitutes Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-88542) (together, the "Registration Statement"), filed by the Company and Monsanto Finance Canada Co., a Nova Scotia unlimited company, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 24, 2005 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to debt securities, common stock and other securities which may be issued from time to time by the Company and the Subsidiary, having an aggregate initial offering price of up to $2,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign currencies or composite currencies.
The Company now proposes to issue an aggregate of $300 million principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes due 2018") and $250 million principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2038 (the "Notes due 2038" and together with the Notes due 2018, the "Notes"), pursuant to the prospectus supplement dated April 10, 2008 and accompanying prospectus included in the Registration Statement, which were filed with Commission on April 11, 2008, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (collectively, the "Prospectus"), which will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2002 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor Trustee (the "Trustee").
We are proving this opinion to you to supplement our prior opinion, dated May 24, 2005, which appears as Exhibit 5 to the Registration Statement.
To enable us to render the opinion set forth below, we have examined the Indenture, the forms of the Notes, corporate records of the Company, and such other documents and materials as we have considered relevant, and have made such investigation of matters of law and of fact as we have considered appropriate.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that when the Notes have executed by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered against payment therefor, the Notes will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company,

enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally as in effect from time to time, and except that the availability of certain equitable remedies may be limited by generally applicable equitable principles.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, and we consent to the use of our name in the Prospectus.
In addition to the assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth above, the opinions set forth herein are further limited by, subject to and based upon the following:

The opinions set forth herein are made as of the date hereof and are subject to, and may be limited by, future changes in the factual matters set forth herein, and we undertake no duty to advise you of the same. The opinions expressed herein are based upon the law in effect (and published or otherwise generally available) on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement these opinions should such law be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise. In rendering our opinions, we have not considered, and hereby disclaim any opinion as to, the application or impact of any laws, decisions, rules or regulations of any other jurisdiction, court or administrative agency.
(b) Our opinions herein are subject to and may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to the rights and remedies of creditors generally including, without limitation, laws relative to fraudulent conveyances, preference and equitable subordination, (ii) general principles or equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (iv) requirements that a claim with respect to any Securities denominated other than in United States dollars (or a judgment denominated other than in United States dollars with respect to such a claim) be converted into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law, and (v) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States or in foreign currency or composite currency.
(c)  Our opinions are further subject to the effect of generally applicable rules of law arising from statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and the rules and regulations of governmental authorities that: (i) limit or affect the enforcement of provisions of a contract that purport to require waiver of the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, diligence and reasonableness; (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; (iii) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct; (iv) may, where less than all of the contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange and

(e)  We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture, the Notes or other agreement purporting or attempting to (i) confer exclusive jurisdiction and/or venue upon certain courts or otherwise waive the defenses of
forum non conveniens
or improper venue, (ii) confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court not having independent grounds therefor, (iii) modify or waive the requirements for effective service of process for any action that may be brought, (iv) waive the right of the Company or any other person to a trial by jury, (v) provide that remedies are cumulative or that decisions by a party are conclusive, or (vi) modify or waive the rights to notice, legal defenses, statutes of limitations or other benefits that cannot be waived under applicable law.
 
Very truly yours,
