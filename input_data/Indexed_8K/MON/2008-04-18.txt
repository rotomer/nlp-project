Ms. Fields will be entitled to receive the same compensation for service as a director as is provided to other directors of the Company under the Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, each non-employee director receives an annual base retainer having a value of $165,000. Additional annual retainers are paid as follows: (i) $25,000 to each of the chair of the Audit and Finance Committee, the chair of the People and Compensation Committee and the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; (ii) $15,000 to each of the chair of the Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Science and Technology Committee; and (iii) $10,000 to each member of the Audit and Finance Committee (other than the chair of that Committee). A non-employee chairman of the board of directors would receive an additional annual retainer of $40,000. Half of the aggregate retainer for each director is payable in deferred common stock, and the remainder is payable, at the election of each director, in the form of restricted common stock, deferred common stock, current cash and/or deferred cash. The Plan also provides that each non-employee director will receive a grant of restricted stock upon commencement of service as a member of the board of directors equal to the annual base retainer divided by the closing price of a share of our common stock on the commencement date.
A Press Release announcing the appointment of Ms. Fields as director as described above is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
