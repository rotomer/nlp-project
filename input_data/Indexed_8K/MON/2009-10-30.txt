5.           
Special Meetings

The Board of Directors shall have the sole right to determine the proper purpose or purposes of such meeting.  Business transacted at a special meeting of shareowners shall be confined to the purpose or purposes of the meeting as stated in the notice of such meeting.  Any previously scheduled special meeting of the shareowners may be postponed by resolution of the Board of Directors upon notice by public announcement given on or prior to the date previously scheduled for such special meeting of shareowners.
 
 
6.           
Place of Meetings
 
 
All meetings of shareowners shall be held at the General Offices of the Company in the County of St. Louis, State of Missouri, unless otherwise determined by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided that the Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the General Corporation Law of Delaware).
 
 
7.           
Notice of Meetings
 
 
(a)           Except as otherwise required by the law of Delaware, notice of each meeting of the shareowners, whether annual or special, shall be given, by or at the direction of the Secretary or Chief Executive Officer, except that (i) it shall not be necessary to give notice to any shareowner who properly waives notice before or after the meeting, whether in writing or by electronic transmission or otherwise, and (ii) no notice of an adjourned meeting need be given except when required under these Bylaws or by law.  Such notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, shall also state the purpose or purposes thereof.  Each notice of a meeting shall be given, personally or by mail or, as provided below, by means of electronic transmission, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting and shall state the time and place of the meeting, or if held by remote communications, the means of remote communications by which shareowners and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and unless it is the annual meeting, shall state at whose direction or request the meeting is called and the purposes for which it is called. The attendance of any shareowner at a meeting, without protesting at the beginning of the meeting that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her; and the requirement of notice may also be waived in accordance with Section 63 of these Bylaws.  Any previously scheduled meeting of shareowners may be postponed, and (unless the Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provides) any special meeting of shareowners may be canceled, by resolution of the Board upon public announcement (as defined in Section 4 of these Bylaws) given on or prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of shareowners.
 
 
(b)           Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to shareowners, any notice to a shareowner given by the Company may be given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the shareowner to whom the notice is given.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the shareowner by written notice to the Company.  Any
 
 
4
 
such consent shall be deemed revoked (i) if the Company is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Company in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.  For purposes of these Bylaws, electronic transmission means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
 
 
(c)           Notice shall be deemed given, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail with postage prepaid, if addressed to a shareowner at his or her address on the Companys records.  Notice given by electronic transmission shall be deemed given  (i) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the shareowner has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the shareowner has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareowner of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the shareowner.
 
 
(d)           An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Company that the notice has been given, whether by a form of electronic transmission or otherwise, shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
 
8.           
Nominations of Directors
 
 
(a)           Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a meeting of shareowners (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareowner of the Company who is a shareowner of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Bylaw and at the time of the annual meeting, who shall be entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Bylaw; clause (ii) shall be the exclusive means for a shareowner to make nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of shareowners.
 
 
To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the Company, the prospective nominee (whether nominated by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by a shareowner), or someone acting on such prospective nominees behalf, must deliver (in accordance with any applicable time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under this Bylaw) to the Secretary at the General Offices of the Company a written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon written request). The prospective nominee must also provide a written representation and agreement, in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request, that such prospective nominee: (A) will abide by the requirements of Section 11(b)(ii) of the
 
 
5
 
Bylaws; (B) is not and will not become a party to (1) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such prospective nominee, if elected as a director of the Company, will act or vote on any issue or question (a Voting Commitment) that has not been disclosed to the Company or (2) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such prospective nominees ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Company, with such prospective nominees fiduciary duties under applicable law; (C) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein; and (D) would be in compliance if elected as a director of the Company, and will comply with all applicable corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Company. For purposes of this Section 8(a), a nominee shall include any person being considered to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors.
 
(b)           Any nominations by shareowners shall be made pursuant to notice in writing, delivered or mailed to the Secretary and received at the General Offices of the Company (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, provided, however, that in the event that the date of the meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareowner must be received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made; or (ii) in the case of a special meeting at which the Board of Directors gives notice that Directors are to be elected, not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such special meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date such special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting is first made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareowners notice as described above. In the case of a special meeting of shareowners at which the Board of Directors gives notice that Directors are to be elected, shareowners may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election only to such position(s) as are specified in the Companys notice of meeting as being up for election at such meeting. Such shareowners notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the shareowner proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director, (A) all information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such persons written consent to being named as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected) and (B) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareowner and beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective
 
 
6
 
affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the shareowner making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the registrant for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; (ii) as to the shareowner giving the notice and the beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, (A) the name and address, as they appear on the Companys books, of such shareowner and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class or series and number of shares of the Companys stock which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record, by such shareowner and such beneficial owner, (C) any Derivative Instrument directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such shareowner or beneficial owner and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Company, (D) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such shareowner or beneficial owner has a right to vote any shares of any security of the Company, (E) any short interest of such shareowner or beneficial owner in any security of the Company (for purposes of this Bylaw a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (F) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Company owned beneficially by such shareowner or beneficial owner that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Company, (G) any proportionate interest in shares of the Company or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such shareowner or beneficial owner is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner, (H) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such shareowner or beneficial owner is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Company or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such shareowners or beneficial owners immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such shareowner and beneficial owner not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date), and (I) any other information relating to such shareowner and beneficial owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii)  a representation that the shareowner is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination; and (iv) a representation as to whether the shareowner or the beneficial owner, if any, intends, or is or intends to be part of a group that intends, (A) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Companys outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (B) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareowners in support of such nomination. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary that information required to be set forth in a shareowners notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may
 
 
7
 
reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent Director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable shareowners understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. Notwithstanding anything in this Bylaw to the contrary, in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public statement naming all the nominees for the additional Directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a shareowners notice required by this Bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for such additional Directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
 
 
(c)           No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Bylaw; and if the chairman should so determine, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, a shareowner shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Bylaw; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations to be considered  pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) of this Bylaw. Nothing in this Section 8 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock of the Company to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
 
9.           
List of Shareowners
 
 
(a)           Not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of any meeting of shareowners, the Secretary of the Company shall prepare a complete list of shareowners entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each shareowner and the number of shares registered in the name of such shareowner; provided, that the Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.  For a period of not less than ten (10) days prior to the meeting, the list shall be available during ordinary business hours for inspection by any shareowner for any purpose germane to the meeting.  During this period, the list shall be kept either (1) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (2) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Company.  If the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareowners of the Company.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any shareowner who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any shareowner during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
 
 
8
 
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
 
 
(b)           The stock ledger of the Company shall be the only evidence as to the identity of the shareowners entitled (i) to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of shareowners, or (ii) to exercise the rights in accordance with Delaware law to examine the stock ledger, the list required by this Bylaw or the books and records of the Company, or for any other purpose permitted under Delaware law.
 
 
10.           
Quorum; Adjournment
 
 
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at all meetings of the shareowners, except as otherwise provided by the law of Delaware, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these  Bylaws.  The shareowners present at any duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of sufficient shareowners to render the remaining shareowners less than a quorum.  Whether or not a quorum is present, either the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time to another time or place or means of remote communications, without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which shareowners and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareowner of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of voting stock shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
 
 
11.           
Voting and Required Vote
 
 
(a)           Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each shareowner shall, at every meeting of shareowners, be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such shareowner.  Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, applicable law, and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company or pursuant to any other regulation applicable to the Company, Directors shall be elected ; and all other questions brought before any meeting of shareowners shall be determined by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting.  In all matters, votes cast in accordance with any method adopted by the Company shall be valid so long as such method is permitted under Delaware law.
in the manner described in paragraph (b) below
 
 
(b)(i)
           
Each director to be elected by shareowners after the effective date of this Bylaw shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.  For purposes of this Bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast for a directors election exceeds the number of votes
 
 
9
 
cast against that directors election.  Votes cast shall exclude abstentions and any broker non-votes with respect to that directors election.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.  For purposes of this Bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination that an election is contested to be made by the Secretary within 30 days following the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in Section 8, based on whether one or more notices of nomination were timely filed in accordance with said Section 8 (provided that the determination that an election is a contested election shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity).  If, prior to the time the Company mails its initial proxy statement in connection with such election of directors, one or more notices of nomination are withdrawn such that the number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election.

In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such person shall submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (A) that persons not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a contested election, and (B) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth herein or adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose.  In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a contested election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, or any committee serving the functions of the committee that is known as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as of the effective date of this Bylaw (the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken.  The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant.  The director whose resignation is being considered shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation.  If such incumbent directors resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 16 of these Bylaws, such director shall continue to serve as a member of the class of directors to which such director was nominated for election until the next succeeding annual meeting of shareowners and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.  At such next succeeding annual meeting, in addition to the nominees for election for the class of directors scheduled to be elected at such meeting, one or more persons may be nominated for election to any directorship held by a director who continues in office but whose term shall have expired prior to such meeting, and any person elected to any such directorship shall be elected to the Board of Directors as a member of the class of directors to which the director previously holding such

directorship was a member.  If a directors resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 17 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(a).
 
 
(c)           Any shareowner entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or may vote the remaining shares against the proposal; but if the shareowner fails to specify the number of shares which the shareowner is voting affirmatively or otherwise indicate how the number of shares to be voted affirmatively is to be determined, it will be conclusively presumed that the shareowners approving vote is with respect to all shares which the shareowner is entitled to vote.
 
 
(d)           Voting need not be by ballot unless requested by a shareowner at the meeting or ordered by the chairman of the meeting; however, all elections of directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation; , that if authorized by the Board, a written ballot may be submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareowner or proxyholder.

No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  A shareowner may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by filing another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Company.
 
 
(b)           A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the Secretary of the Company.

Indemnification
 
 
(a)           The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding) by reason of the fact that the person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, non-profit entity, or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
 
 
22
 
all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw shall be a contract right.  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Bylaw with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person or a claim made by such person against the Company only if such proceeding or claim was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
 
(b)           Subject to applicable law, the Company shall pay the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, , , that if and to the extent required by law the payment of expenses incurred by any person covered hereunder in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the affected person to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
provided
however
 
 
(c)           If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Bylaw is not paid in full within thirty days, or such other period as might be provided pursuant to contract, after a written claim therefor has been received by the Company, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim or may seek whatever other remedy might be provided pursuant to contract.  In any such action the Company shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.  If successful in whole or in part, claimant shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim.  Neither the failure of the Company (including its Directors, independent legal counsel or shareowners) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Directors, independent legal counsel or shareowners) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
 
(d)           Any determination regarding whether indemnification of any person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such person with the consent of the Company (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).
 
 
(e)           The Company may, but shall not be required to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding) by reason of the fact that the person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, non-profit entity, or other enterprise, including service with

respect to employee benefit plans, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person.
 
 
(f)           The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareowners or disinterested Directors or otherwise.
 
 
(g)           Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Bylaw shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to or at the time of such repeal or modification.

Waiver of Notice
 
 
Whenever notice is required to be given pursuant to the law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting of shareowners or the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the shareowner or Director attends such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareowners or the Board of Directors or committee thereof need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.

(d)           An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Company that the notice has been given, whether by a form of electronic transmission or otherwise, shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent Director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable shareowners understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, a shareowner shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Bylaw; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations to be considered  pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) of this Bylaw.

For a period of not less than ten (10) days prior to the meeting, the list shall be available during ordinary business hours for inspection by any shareowner for any purpose germane to the meeting.  During this period, the list shall be kept either (1) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (2) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Company.  If the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareowners of the Company.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any shareowner who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any shareowner during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
 
 
8
 
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
 
 
(b)           The stock ledger of the Company shall be the only evidence as to the identity of the shareowners entitled (i) to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of shareowners, or (ii) to exercise the rights in accordance with Delaware law to examine the stock ledger, the list required by this Bylaw or the books and records of the Company, or for any other purpose permitted under Delaware law.

Quorum; Adjournment
 
 
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at all meetings of the shareowners, except as otherwise provided by the law of Delaware, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these  Bylaws.  The shareowners present at any duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of sufficient shareowners to render the remaining shareowners less than a quorum.  Whether or not a quorum is present, either the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time to another time or place or means of remote communications, without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which shareowners and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareowner of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of voting stock shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

Voting and Required Vote
 
 
(a)           Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each shareowner shall, at every meeting of shareowners, be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such shareowner.  Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, applicable law, and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company or pursuant to any other regulation applicable to the Company, Directors shall be elected ; and all other questions brought before any meeting of shareowners shall be determined by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting.  In all matters, votes cast in accordance with any method adopted by the Company shall be valid so long as such method is permitted under Delaware law.
in the manner described in paragraph (b) below
 
 
(b)(i)
           
Each director to be elected by shareowners after the effective date of this Bylaw shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.  For purposes of this Bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast for a directors election exceeds the number of votes
 
 
9
 
cast against that directors election.  Votes cast shall exclude abstentions and any broker non-votes with respect to that directors election.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.  For purposes of this Bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination that an election is contested to be made by the Secretary within 30 days following the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in Section 8, based on whether one or more notices of nomination were timely filed in accordance with said Section 8 (provided that the determination that an election is a contested election shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity).  If, prior to the time the Company mails its initial proxy statement in connection with such election of directors, one or more notices of nomination are withdrawn such that the number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election.
 
 
          
(ii)
 
In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such person shall submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (A) that persons not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a contested election, and (B) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth herein or adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose.  In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a contested election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, or any committee serving the functions of the committee that is known as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as of the effective date of this Bylaw (the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken.  The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant.  The director whose resignation is being considered shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation.  If such incumbent directors resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 16 of these Bylaws, such director shall continue to serve as a member of the class of directors to which such director was nominated for election until the next succeeding annual meeting of shareowners and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.  At such next succeeding annual meeting, in addition to the nominees for election for the class of directors scheduled to be elected at such meeting, one or more persons may be nominated for election to any directorship held by a director who continues in office but whose term shall have expired prior to such meeting, and any person elected to any such
 
 
10
 
directorship shall be elected to the Board of Directors as a member of the class of directors to which the director previously holding such directorship was a member.  If a directors resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 17 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(a).
 
 
(c)           Any shareowner entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or may vote the remaining shares against the proposal; but if the shareowner fails to specify the number of shares which the shareowner is voting affirmatively or otherwise indicate how the number of shares to be voted affirmatively is to be determined, it will be conclusively presumed that the shareowners approving vote is with respect to all shares which the shareowner is entitled to vote.
 
 
(d)           Voting need not be by ballot unless requested by a shareowner at the meeting or ordered by the chairman of the meeting; however, all elections of directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation; , that if authorized by the Board, a written ballot may be submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareowner or proxyholder.

12.           
Proxies
 
 
(a)           Each shareowner entitled to vote at a meeting of shareowners may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareowner by proxy, in any manner permitted by law, including, without limitation, in the form of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the shareowner.  No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  A shareowner may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by filing another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Company.
 
 
(b)           A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the Secretary of the Company.
 
 
13.

11
 
replace any inspector unable to act.  If any of the inspectors appointed shall fail to attend, or refuse or be unable to serve, substitutes shall be appointed by the chairman of the meeting.  Each inspector, who may be an employee of the Company, shall have such duties as are provided by law, and shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such persons ability.  The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the shareowners will vote at the meeting.

The person presiding over the meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if the person presiding over the meeting should so determine and declare, any such matter or business shall not be transacted or considered.
 
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Bylaws, unless otherwise required by law, if a shareowner (or qualified representative) does not appear at the meeting of shareowners of the Company to present a nomination or business pursuant to Section 4 or Section 8 of these Bylaws, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, even though proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company.  In order to be considered a qualified representative of the shareowner, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareowner or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareowner to act for such shareowner as proxy at the meeting of shareowners, and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareowners.

Indemnification
 
 
(a)           The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding) by reason of the fact that the person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, non-profit entity, or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
 
 
22
 
all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw shall be a contract right.  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Bylaw with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person or a claim made by such person against the Company only if such proceeding or claim was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
 
(b)           Subject to applicable law, the Company shall pay the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, , , that if and to the extent required by law the payment of expenses incurred by any person covered hereunder in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the affected person to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
provided

(c)           If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Bylaw is not paid in full within thirty days, or such other period as might be provided pursuant to contract, after a written claim therefor has been received by the Company, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim or may seek whatever other remedy might be provided pursuant to contract.  In any such action the Company shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.  If successful in whole or in part, claimant shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim.  Neither the failure of the Company (including its Directors, independent legal counsel or shareowners) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Directors, independent legal counsel or shareowners) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
 
(d)           Any determination regarding whether indemnification of any person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such person with the consent of the Company (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).
 
 
(e)           The Company may, but shall not be required to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding) by reason of the fact that the person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, non-profit entity, or other enterprise, including service with

respect to employee benefit plans, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person.
 
 
(f)           The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareowners or disinterested Directors or otherwise.
 
 
(g)           Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Bylaw shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to or at the time of such repeal or modification.

Waiver of Notice
 
 
Whenever notice is required to be given pursuant to the law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting of shareowners or the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the shareowner or Director attends such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareowners or the Board of Directors or committee thereof need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.
