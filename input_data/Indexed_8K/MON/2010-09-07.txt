On August 30, 2010, Monsanto Company (the Company) entered into new Change-of-Control Employment Security Agreements with the following named executive officers:  Messrs. Begemann, Casale and Grant, and Dr. Fraley.  A form of the new Change of Control Agreements is attached as Exhibit 10 and incorporated herein by reference (the COC Agreement). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings provided in the COC Agreement.
The COC Agreement generally provides that during the Protected Period, which runs from the first day following a Change of Control to the second anniversary of that date, the Executives position and duties shall be materially commensurate with his position and duties before the Change of Control, the location of his employment and travel requirements shall not change substantially, and the Executives salary, incentive opportunities and opportunities to participate in Company benefit plans shall be at least commensurate with opportunities before the Change of Control.
In the event the Executives employment with the Company terminates during the Protected Period, or in some cases earlier in anticipation of the Change of Control, subject to the terms of the COC Agreements:

In the event a Change of Control occurs prior to September 1, 2011, the COC Agreement provides that the Company would pay the Executive a Gross-Up Payment for any Payment subject to an Excise Tax, unless the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of an amount equal to three times the Executives base amount under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, minus $1.00, which is the Safe Harbor Amount.  However, if a Change of Control occurs after September 1, 2011, the Company will not pay a Gross-Up Payment but will reduce Payments such that the aggregate amount equals the Safe Harbor Amount, if the Executives Net After-Tax Receipt of Payments would be greater than it would be without the reduction.
Under the COC Agreement, a Change of Control includes:
The Executive is required to devote reasonable attention and time to the Company during the Protected Period and to protect the Companys Confidential Information.
The term of the COC Agreement is one year, provided that the COC Agreement shall renew on August 31 of each successive year unless the Company gives notice of non-renewal by the preceding July 1.
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the COC Agreement attached.

7.           .   (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding (but subject to the limitation set forth in Section 7(f)), in the event the Accounting Firm shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject the Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The Agreement
Limitation on Payments Under Certain Circumstances

Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced.  If the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, the Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which the Executive is entitled hereunder.
 
 (b)            If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof.  All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 7 shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive, except to the extent the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final and binding determination inconsistent therewith, and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination.  For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Pa rachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.

 (c)            As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayment") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Safe Harbor Amount hereunder.  In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Ser vice against either the Company or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Executive shall pay promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Overpayment is determined) any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either

Certain Additional Payments by the Company
 
 (b)           If any Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay the Executive a Gross-Up Payment (regardless of whether the Executives employment has terminated).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then the Company shall not pay the Executive a Gross-Up Payment, and the Agreement Payments shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount; provided, that if even after all Payments due hereunder are reduced to zero, the Parachute Value of all Payments would still exceed the Safe Harbor Amount, then the Gross-Up Payment shall be made and no reduction of any Payments shall be made.  The reduct ion of the Payments due hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the Payments in the following order:  (1) any Payments under Section 4(a)(1)(B), (2) any other cash Payments on a pro rata basis, and (3) any remaining Payments on a pro rata basis, and, subject to the foregoing, shall be made in such a manner as to maximize the economic present value of all Payments actually made to the Executive, determined by the Accounting Firm as of the date of the applicable Section 280G Change of Control using the discount rate required by Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.
   
   
 
(c)           All determinations required to be made under this Section 8. including whether and when Gross-Up Payments are required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payments, whether and in what manner any Payments are to be reduced pursuant to the second sentence of Section 8(b), and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, and shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive, except to the extent the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final and binding determination inconsistent therewith.

As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an Underpayment).  In the event the Accounting Firm determines that there has been an Underpayment or the Executive is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax as a result of a
 
 
12
 
claim described in Section 8(d), then the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.

, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an After-Tax basis, for any Excise Tax or Taxes imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses.  Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(d), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either direct the Executive to pay the Taxes claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial
provided, however
 
 
13
 
jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , that, if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall remit the amount of such payment to the Executive or to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an After-Tax basis, from any Excise Tax or Taxes imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such advance; and , that any extension of the relevant statute of limitations is limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore, the Companys control of the contest shall be lim ited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
provided, however

If, after the Company has remitted an amount pursuant to Section 8(d), a determination is made that the Executive is not entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after suc h determination, then the Executive shall not be required to pay such amount to the Company, and any Gross-Up Payment owed to the Executive shall be reduced (but not below zero) by such amount.
 
(f)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding.  In addition, the Company shall pay all amounts that it is required to pay to or on behalf of the Executive under the foregoing provisions of this Section 8 not later than the end of the calendar year following (1) the calendar year in which the related Taxes are remitted to the applicable taxing authority, or (2) in the case of amounts relating to a claim described in Section 8(d) that does not result in the remittance of any Taxes, the cal endar year in which the claim is finally settled or otherwise resolved.

14
 
The amount of such fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and the Executives right to have the Company pay such fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
 
9.           .  (a)  The Executive shall use the Executives best efforts and diligence both during and after employment by the Company and the Affiliated Companies to protect the confidential, trade secret and/or proprietary character of all Confidential Information.
