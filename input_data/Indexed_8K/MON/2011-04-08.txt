Recast Quarterly Report.
This Current Report on Form 8-K revises portions of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Monsanto Company ("the company") for the quarter ended Nov. 30, 2010 (the "Quarterly Report"), which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 7, 2011, to retrospectively reflect subsequent changes in the company's operating segments, which occurred in February 2011.
The company reorganized the operating segments within our Agricultural Productivity reportable segment as a result of a change in the way the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, evaluates the performance of operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. The "and other glyphosate-based herbicides" operating segment and the "all other agricultural products" operating segments within Agricultural Productivity were combined into one operating segment titled "Agricultural Productivity" as the company shifted management of these product lines to one business representing our weed management platform and supporting our Seeds and Genomics business.
Roundup
The change in operating segments had no impact on the company's reportable segments or the company's historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The recast historical financial information in this Form 8-K does not represent an amendment to or restatement of the company's first quarter 2011 consolidated financial statements as previously issued in the Quarterly Report.
Accordingly, the company has updated the presentation of the Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009 segment information originally included in its Quarterly Report, to be consistent with the revised operating segment structure. These updates are reflected in Exhibits 99.1  99.2 to this Current Report. These exhibits are consistent with the presentation of reporting and operating segments in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended Feb. 28, 2011.
Revisions to the Quarterly Report included in this Current Report on Form 8-K as noted above supersede the corresponding portions of the company's Quarterly Report. All other information in the Quarterly Report remains unchanged. This Current Report does not modify or update the disclosures therein in any way, nor does it reflect any subsequent information or events, other than as required to reflect the change in segments as described above. The information in this Current Report, including Exhibits 99.1-99.2 should be read in conjunction with the Quarterly Report and any documents filed by the company subsequent to the filing of the Quarterly Report.
 
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
NOTE 1. BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Monsanto Company (the "company"), along with its subsidiaries, is a leading global provider of agricultural products for farmers. Monsanto's seeds, biotechnology trait products, and herbicides provide farmers with solutions that improve productivity, reduce the costs of farming and produce better foods for consumers and better feed for animals.
Monsanto manages its business in two segments: Seeds and Genomics and Agricultural Productivity. Through the Seeds and Genomics segment, Monsanto produces leading seed brands, including DEKALB ASGROWDELTAPINE, SEMINIS and DE RUITERand Monsanto develops biotechnology traits that assist farmers in controlling insects and weeds. Monsanto also provides other seed companies with genetic material and biotechnology traits for their seed brands. Through the Agricultural Productivity segment, the company manufactures ROUNDUP and HARNESS brand herbicides and other herbicides. See Note 22  Segment Information  for further details.

,
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company announced plans to divest its animal agricultural products business, which focused on dairy cow productivity (the Dairy business). This transaction was consummated on Oct. 1, 2008. As a result, financial data for this business has been presented as discontinued operations. The financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Accordingly, for all periods presented herein, the Statements of Consolidated Operations have been conformed to this presentation. See Note 23  Discontinued Operations  for further details.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been audited but have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, these unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. This Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Monsanto's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010. Financial information for the first three months of fiscal year 2011 should not be annualized because of the seasonality of the company's business.
NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In July 2010, the FASB issued a new update that requires enhanced disclosures regarding credit quality and the related allowance for credit losses of financing receivables. The new disclosures will require additional information for nonaccrual and past due accounts, the allowance for credit losses, impaired loans, credit quality, and account modifications. Accordingly, Monsanto will include the new disclosure requirements as of the end of the reporting period beginning in second quarter 2011, and the disclosures related to activities during the reporting period beginning in the third quarter 2011. The company is currently evaluating the disclosure impact of including this update on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the ASC. This amendment requires disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. It also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This amendment was effective for periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Accordingly, Monsanto prospectively adopted this amendment in third quarter 2010, and adopted the additional Level 3 requirements in fiscal year 2011. See Note 14  Fair Value Measurements  for the new disclosures.
In June 2009, the FASB issued a standard that requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2009. Accordingly, Monsanto adopted this standard on Sept. 1, 2010. See Note 5  Variable Interest Entities  for the disclosures required by this standard.
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
In June 2009, the FASB issued a standard that removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and removes the exception from applying consolidation principles to a QSPE. This standard also clarifies the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2009. Accordingly, Monsanto adopted this standard in first quarter fiscal year 2011. See Note 4  Customer Financing Programs  for additional discussion regarding impact on its QSPE related to a Brazilian financing program and other financing programs.
NOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Effective Sept. 1, 2009, Monsanto adopted the new guidance in the Business Combinations topic of the ASC for acquisitions subsequent to that date.
In April 2010, Monsanto acquired a corn and soybean processing plant located in Paine, Chile from Anasac, a Santiago-based company that provides seed processing services. The acquisition of this plant, which qualifies as a business under the Business Combinations topic of the ASC, allows Monsanto to reduce third party seed production in Chile, while increasing production supply. Acquisition costs were less than $1 million and were classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses. The total cash paid and the fair value of the acquisition were $34 million, and it was primarily allocated to fixed assets, goodwill, and intangibles. The primary items that generated the goodwill were the premiums paid by the company for the right to control the business acquired and the value of the acquired assembled workforce. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
2010 Acquisitions:
In October 2009, Monsanto acquired the remaining 51 percent equity interest in Seminium, S.A. (Seminium), a leading Argentinean corn seed company. Acquisition costs were less than $1 million and were classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. The total fair value of Seminium was $36 million, and it was primarily allocated to inventory, fixed assets, intangibles, and goodwill. This fair value includes $20 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) and $16 million for the fair value of Monsanto's 49 percent equity interest in Seminium held prior to the acquisition. The primary items that generated goodwill were the premiums paid by the company for the right to control the business acquired and the value of the acquired assembled workforce. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Income of approximately $12 million was recognized from the re-measurement to fair value of Monsanto's previous equity interest in Seminium and is included in other (income) expense, net in the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the quarter ended Nov. 30, 2009.
For all fiscal year 2010 acquisitions described above, the business operations and employees of the acquired entities were included in the Seeds and Genomics segment results upon acquisition. These acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions. The measurement period for purchase price allocations ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances becomes available, but does not exceed twelve months. If new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed, Monsanto will retrospectively adjust the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date. Proforma information related to acquisitions is not presented because the impact of the acquisitions on the company's consolidated results of operations is not considered to be significant.
NOTE 4. CUSTOMER FINANCING PROGRAMS
Monsanto participates in a revolving financing program in Brazil that allows Monsanto to transfer up to 1 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $585 million) for selected customers in Brazil to a special purpose entity, formerly a qualified special purpose entity. Third parties, primarily investment funds, hold an 88 percent senior interest in the entity, and Monsanto holds the remaining 12 percent interest. Under the arrangement, a recourse provision requires Monsanto to cover the first 12 percent of credit losses within the program. The company has evaluated its relationship with the entity under updated guidance within the Consolidation topic of the ASC and, as a result, the entity has been consolidated effective Sept. 1, 2010. For further information on this topic, see Note 5  Variable Interest Entities.
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
In this program, receivables are considered delinquent when payments are one day past due, but the provisions on the financing program for nonperformance start on the 15th day past due. If a customer fails to pay an obligation when it is due, the provisions for bad debt on the program will be recorded. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively, there were $1 million and $3 million of receivables sold through this financing program that were delinquent. Based on the company's historical collection experience with these customers and a current assessment of credit exposure, Monsanto recorded its recourse provision at $5 million as of Aug. 31, 2010, and Monsanto recorded a bad debt allowance related to these receivables of $2 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The maximum potential amount of exposure under the program was $13 million and $15 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. If Monsanto is called upon to make payments under the recourse provision, it would have the benefit under the financing program of any amounts subsequently collected from the customer.
Monsanto has an agreement in the United States to sell customer receivables up to a maximum of $500 million and to service such accounts. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under the Transfers and Servicing topic of the ASC and accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The gross amount of receivables sold totaled $3 million and $2 million for the first three months of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. The agreement includes recourse provisions and thus a liability was established at the time of sale that approximates fair value based upon the company's historical collection experience with such receivables and a current assessment of credit exposure. The recourse liability recorded by Monsanto was $2 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the recourse provisions of the agreement was $7 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The outstanding balance of the receivables sold was $138 million and $223 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. There were delinquent loans of $2 million and $3 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
Monsanto also sells accounts receivable in the United States, European regions and Argentina, both with and without recourse. These sales qualify for sales treatment under the Transfers and Servicing topic of the ASC and accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The gross amounts of receivables sold totaled $1 million and $13 million for the first three months of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. The liability for the guarantees for sales with recourse is recorded at an amount that approximates fair value, based on the company's historical collection experience for the customers associated with the sale of the receivables and a current assessment of credit exposure. The liability recorded by Monsanto was less than $1 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the recourse provisions of the agreements was $42 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The outstanding balance of the receivables sold was $64 million and $91 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. There were no delinquent loans as of Nov. 30, 2010, or Aug. 31, 2010.
Monsanto has additional agreements with lenders to establish programs that provide financing of up to 550 million Brazilian reais (approximately $320 million) for selected customers in Brazil. Monsanto provides a guarantee of the loans in the event of customer default. The term of the guarantee is equivalent to the term of the bank loans. The liability for the guarantees is recorded at an amount that approximates fair value, based on the company's historical collection experience with customers that participate in the program and a current assessment of credit exposure. The guarantee liability recorded by Monsanto was $1 million and $3 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. If performance is required under the guarantee, Monsanto may retain amounts that are subsequently collected from customers. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee was $60 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The loan balance outstanding for these programs was $60 million and $100 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. There were no delinquent loans as of Nov. 30, 2010, and delinquent loans of $2 million as of Aug. 31, 2010.
Monsanto also has similar agreements with banks that provide financing to its customers in the United States, Brazil, Europe and Argentina. Under these programs, Monsanto provides a guarantee of the loans in the event of customer default. The terms of the guarantees are equivalent to the terms of the bank loans. The liability for the guarantees is recorded at an amount that approximates fair value, based on the company's historical collection experience with customers that participate in the program and a current assessment of credit exposure. The guarantee liability recorded by Monsanto was $1 million and $2 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. If performance is required under the guarantee, Monsanto may retain amounts that are subsequently collected from customers. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was $76 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The loan balance outstanding for these programs was $78 million and $36 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.

NOTE 5. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
Effective Sept. 1, 2010, Monsanto prospectively adopted the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involving variable interest entities (VIEs). A VIE is a legal entity that lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities, or the equity investors of the entity as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. Monsanto is involved with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs. Monsanto has determined that the company holds variable interests in entities that are established as revolving financing programs. These programs allow the company to transfer a limited amount of customer receivables to a VIE. One program is in Brazil and the other is in Argentina. In addition, Monsanto has various variable interests in biotechnology companies that focus on plant gene research, development, and commercialization. These variable interests have also been determined to be VIEs.
If a company is considered the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the company is required to consolidate the entity. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. For all VIEs in which the company has a variable interest, the company performs ongoing qualitative assessments to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary. In determining whether Monsanto is the primary beneficiary, a number of factors are considered, including the structure of the entity, contractual provisions that grant any additional rights to influence or control the economic performance of the VIE, and the company's obligation to absorb significant losses. In addition, the company determines which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and whether the company has any rights that would allow it to direct those activities. If Monsanto is determined to be the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated.
As a result of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance, Monsanto was required to consolidate certain VIEs that are established as revolving financing programs including the special purpose entity referred to in Note 4  Customer Financing Programs. As of the date of the initial consolidation of these VIEs, the company measured the assets and liabilities of the newly consolidated VIEs at their carrying value. The company was not required to deconsolidate any VIEs as of Sept. 1, 2010. The cumulative effect of the adoption of this guidance was insignificant to additional contributed capital, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss and, therefore, not identified separately on the Statement of Consolidated Shareowners' Equity and Comprehensive Income but is recorded within the Statement of Consolidated Operations.
Consolidated VIEs
Under the accounting guidance effective prior to Sept. 1, 2010, none of the interests in VIEs held were consolidated by Monsanto. For the most part, the VIEs involving the revolving financing programs are funded by investments from the company and other third parties, primarily investment funds, and have been established to service Monsanto's customer receivables. Creditors have no recourse against Monsanto in the event of default by these VIEs nor does the company have any implied or unfunded commitments to these VIEs. The company's financial or other support provided to these VIEs is limited to its original investment. Even though Monsanto holds a subordinate interest in the VIEs, the VIEs were established to service transactions involving the company and the company determines the receivables that are included in the revolving financing programs. Therefore, the determination is that Monsanto has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of the VIEs. As a result, the company is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, effective Sept. 1, 2010, these VIEs have been consolidated in Monsanto's Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets of these VIEs may only be used to settle the obligations of the respective entity. Third-party investors in the VIEs do not have recourse to the general assets of Monsanto other than the maximum exposure to loss relating to the VIE. The following table presents the carrying value of assets and liabilities, which are identified as restricted assets and liabilities on the company's Condensed

(continued)
Statement of Consolidated Financial Position, and the maximum exposure to loss relating to the VIEs for which Monsanto is the primary beneficiary.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
Monsanto has variable interests through investments and arrangements with biotechnology companies that focus on plant gene research, development, and commercialization. The company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments or arrangements other than its original interest. The company also has no implied or unfunded commitments to these VIEs. The company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of Monsanto's investment in comparison to the total equity of the VIEs, the level of the company's obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIEs, and the company's inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. Monsanto's maximum exposure to loss on these variable interests is limited to the amount of the company's investment in the entity. The following table presents the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and the maximum exposure to loss relating to VIEs that the company does not consolidate:

NOTE 6. RESTRUCTURING
Restructuring charges were recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Operations as follows:
 
On June 23, 2009, the company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (2009 Restructuring Plan) to take future actions to reduce costs in light of the changing market supply environment for glyphosate. These actions are designed to enable Monsanto to stabilize the Agricultural Productivity business and allow it to deliver optimal gross profit and a sustainable level of operating cash in the coming years, while better aligning spending and working capital needs. The company also announced that it will take steps to better align the resources of its global seeds and traits business. These actions include certain product and brand rationalization within the seed businesses. On Sept. 9, 2009, the company committed to take additional actions related to the previously announced restructuring plan. Furthermore, while implementing the plan, the company identified additional opportunities to better align the company's resources, and on Aug. 26, 2010, committed to take additional actions. The plan was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, and the remaining payments will be made by the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal year 2011.
The following table displays the pretax charges of $7 million and $14 million incurred by segment under the 2009 Restructuring Plan for the first quarters ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009, respectively, as well as the cumulative
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
pretax charges of $737 million under the 2009 Restructuring Plan.
The company's written human resource policies are indicative of an ongoing benefit arrangement with respect to severance packages. Benefits paid pursuant to an ongoing benefit arrangement are specifically excluded from the Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations topic of the ASC, therefore severance charges incurred in connection with the 2009 Restructuring Plan are accounted for when probable and estimable as required under the Compensation  Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits topic of the ASC. In addition, when the decision to commit to a restructuring plan requires an asset impairment review, Monsanto evaluates such impairment issues under the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the ASC.
In first quarter 2011, pretax restructuring charges of $7 million were recorded. The facility closures/ exit costs of $25 million relate primarily to the finalization of the termination of a corn toller contract in the United States. In workforce reductions, approximately $7 million of additional charges were offset by $25 million of reversals. Although positions originally included in the plan were eliminated, individuals found new roles within the company due to attrition. In first quarter 2010, pretax restructuring charges of $14 million were recorded, primarily relating to work force reductions in Europe.
The following table summarizes the activities related to the company's 2009 Restructuring Plan.

NOTE 9. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, by segment, are as follows:
In first quarter 2011, goodwill increased due to the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments. There were no events or circumstances indicating that goodwill might be impaired as of Nov. 30, 2010. The 2011 annual goodwill impairment test will be performed as of March 1, 2011.

Information regarding the company's other intangible assets is as follows:
Total amortization expense of other intangible assets was $38 million in first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and $40 million in first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Estimated intangible asset amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years for owned assets as of Nov. 30, 2010, has not changed significantly from the amounts disclosed in Monsanto's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010.
NOTE 10. INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY AFFILIATES
Investments
During fiscal year 2010, Monsanto invested in long-term debt securities with a cost of $15 million, which were classified as available-for-sale as of Aug. 31, 2010. The investments were recorded in other assets in the Condensed Statement of Consolidated Financial Position at their fair value of $10 million as of Aug. 31, 2010. Net unrealized losses (net of deferred taxes) of $3 million were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareowners' equity related to these investments as of Aug. 31, 2010. As a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard within the Consolidation topic of the ASC, the special purpose entity in which the company invested is now consolidated and the investment is no longer included in other assets in the Condensed Statement of Consolidated Financial Position. See Note 5  Variable Interest Entities  for further discussion related to these debt securities.
Monsanto has investments in long-term equity securities, which are considered available-for-sale. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, these long-term equity securities are recorded in other assets in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position at a fair value of $32 million and $23 million, respectively. Net unrealized gains (net of deferred taxes) of $4 million and $3 million are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareowners' equity related to these investments as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
Equity Affiliates
Monsanto owns a 19 percent interest in a seed supplier that produces, conditions, and distributes corn and soybean seeds. Monsanto is accounting for this investment as an equity method investment as Monsanto has the ability to exercise significant influence over the seed supplier. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, this investment is recorded in other assets in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position at $67 million and $65 million, respectively. Monsanto purchased $69 million and $19 million of inventory from the seed supplier for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009, respectively. There were no sales of inventory to the seed supplier for both the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, the amount payable to the seed supplier was $33 million and $5 million, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. As of Nov. 30, 2010, there were no prepayments, while the prepayment as of Aug. 31, 2010, was $7 million, included in other current assets in the Condensed Statement of Consolidated Financial Position related to inventory delivered in fiscal year 2011.

NOTE 11. DEFERRED REVENUE
In first quarter 2008, Monsanto entered into a corn herbicide tolerance and insect control trait technologies agreement with Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Among its provisions, the agreement modified certain existing corn license agreements between the parties, included provisions under which the parties agreed not to assert certain intellectual property rights against each other, and granted each party the right to use certain regulatory data of the other in order to develop additional products. As a result of the new agreement which requires fixed annual payments, the company recorded a receivable and deferred revenue of $635 million in first quarter 2008. Cumulative cash receipts will be $725 million over an eight-year period. Revenue of $20 million related to this agreement was recorded in the first three months of fiscal years 2011 and 2010. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, the remaining receivable balance is $406 million and $470 million, respectively. The majority of this balance is included in long-term receivables, and the current portion is included in trade receivables. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, the remaining deferred revenue balance is $377 million and $397 million, respectively. The majority of this balance is included in long-term deferred revenue, and the current portion is included in deferred revenues in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. The interest portion of this receivable is reported in interest income and totaled $4 million for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009.
In third quarter 2008, Monsanto and Syngenta entered into a GENUITY ROUNDUP READY 2 YIELD Soybean License Agreement. The agreement grants Syngenta access to Monsanto's GENUITY ROUNDUP READY 2 YIELD Soybean technology in consideration of royalty payments from Syngenta, based on sales. Under this agreement Syngenta will fulfill the contractual sales volumes over a nine-year period. The minimum obligation from Syngenta over this period is $81 million. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, the remaining receivable balance is $73 million related to the net present value of expected payments under this agreement. The majority of this balance is included in long-term receivables in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position and the current portion is included in trade receivables. The interest portion of this receivable is reported in interest income in the Statements of Consolidated Operations and was less than $1 million for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009. As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, the remaining deferred revenue balance was $66 million and $67 million, respectively. The majority of this balance is included in long-term deferred revenue, and the current portion is included in deferred revenues in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position.
NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES
Management regularly assesses the tax risk of the company's tax return filing positions for all open years and establishes reserves accordingly. During first quarter 2010 statutes expired in several jurisdictions and an audit was completed in an ex-U.S. jurisdiction. Primarily as a result of these items, Monsanto recorded a tax benefit of $16 million in first quarter 2010.
NOTE 13. DEBT AND OTHER CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS
Monsanto plans to issue new fixed-rate debt on or before Aug. 15, 2012, to repay $486 million of 7% Senior Notes that are due on Aug. 15, 2012. In March 2009, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $250 million. The purpose of the swaps was to hedge the variability of the forecasted interest payments on this expected debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued. Unrealized losses, net of tax, of $1 million and $8 million were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to reflect the aftertax change in the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swaps as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. In August 2010, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million. The purpose of the swaps was to hedge the variability of the forecasted interest payments on this expected debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued. An unrealized gain and loss, net of tax, of $8 million and $9 million were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to reflect the aftertax change in the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swaps as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. These swaps are accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the ASC.
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
Monsanto plans to issue new fixed-rate debt on or before April 15, 2011. In July 2010, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million. The purpose of the swaps was to hedge the variability of the forecasted interest payments on this expected debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued. Unrealized losses, net of tax, of $6 million and $7 million were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to reflect the aftertax change in the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swaps as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
The fair value of the total short-term debt was $394 million and $241 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. The fair value of the total long-term debt was $1,904 million and $2,094 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
As of Nov. 30, 2010, Monsanto had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. As of Nov. 30, 2009, Monsanto had commercial paper borrowings outstanding of $195 million which was included in short-term debt on the Condensed Statement of Consolidated Financial Position.
In April 2010, Monsanto completed the purchase of the Chesterfield Village Research Center from Pfizer. There is debt outstanding of $324 million on the purchase price which is included in short-term debt on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Financial Position as of Nov. 30, 2010.
NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Monsanto determines the fair market value of its financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, estimates from brokers, and other appropriate valuation techniques. The company uses the fair value hierarchy established in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the ASC, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy contains three levels as follows, with Level 3 representing the lowest level of input:
     Level 1  Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.
     Level 2  Values based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
     Level 3  Values generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions would reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques could include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Monsanto does not currently have any instruments with fair value determined using Level 3 inputs.
The following tables set forth by level Monsanto's assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010. As required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the ASC, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement. Monsanto's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Level 3 asset for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010.
Disclosures for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed as fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were required prospectively beginning Sept. 1, 2009.
There were no significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition during fiscal year 2011.
The recorded amounts of cash, trade receivables, miscellaneous receivables, third-party guarantees, accounts payable, grower accruals, accrued marketing programs and miscellaneous short-term accruals approximate their fair values as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010.
NOTE 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash Flow Hedges
The company uses foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of anticipated sales or purchases denominated in foreign currencies. The company enters into these contracts to protect itself against the risk that the eventual net cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
Monsanto's commodity price risk management strategy is to use derivative instruments to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in commodity prices. Price fluctuations in commodities, mainly in corn and soybeans, can cause the actual prices paid to production growers for corn and soybean seeds to differ from anticipated cash outlays. Monsanto uses commodity futures and options contracts to manage these risks. Monsanto's energy and raw material risk management strategy is to use derivative instruments to minimize significant unanticipated manufacturing cost fluctuations that may arise from volatility in natural gas, diesel and ethylene prices.
Monsanto's interest rate risk management strategy is to use derivative instruments, such as forward-starting interest rate swaps, to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates of the company's borrowings and to manage the interest rate sensitivity of its debt.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
The maximum term over which the company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flow (for all forecasted transactions) is 21 months for foreign currency hedges, 40 months for commodity hedges and 21 months for interest rate hedges. During the next 12 months, a pretax net loss of approximately $4 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings. During the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, no cash flow hedges were discontinued. During the three months ended Nov. 30, 2009, a pretax loss of $4 million was reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges, because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur by the end of the originally specified time period.
Fair Value Hedges
The company uses commodity futures and options contracts as fair value hedges to manage the value of its soybean inventory. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, both the gain or loss on the
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. No fair value hedges were discontinued during the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, or Nov. 30, 2009.
Net Investment Hedges
To protect the value of its investment from adverse changes in exchange rates, the company may, from time to time, hedge a portion of its net investment in one or more of its foreign subsidiaries. Gains or losses on derivative instruments that are designated as a net investment hedge are included in accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
The company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany receivables and payables. Both the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
The company uses commodity option contracts to hedge anticipated cash payments to corn growers in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, which can fluctuate with changes in corn price. Because these option contracts do not meet the provisions specified by the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the ASC, they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivatives is recognized in current earnings.
To reduce credit exposure in Latin America, Monsanto collects payments on certain customer accounts in grain. Such payments in grain are negotiated at or near the time Monsanto's products are sold to the customers and are valued at the prevailing grain commodity prices. By entering into forward sales contracts related to grain, Monsanto mitigates the commodity price exposure from the time a contract is signed with a customer until the time a grain merchant collects the grain from the customer on Monsanto's behalf. The forward sales contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the ASC. Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivatives is recognized in current earnings.
Financial instruments are neither held nor issued by the company for trading purposes.
The notional amounts of the company's derivative instruments outstanding as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, were as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
The gains and losses on the company's derivative instruments were as follows:
 
Most of the company's outstanding foreign-currency derivatives are covered by International Swap Dealers' Association (ISDA) Master Agreements with the counterparties. There are no requirements to post collateral under these agreements; however, should the company's credit rating fall below a specified rating immediately following the merger of the company with another entity, the counterparty may require all outstanding derivatives under the ISDA Master Agreement to be settled immediately at current market value, which equals carrying value. Any foreign-currency derivatives that are not covered by ISDA Master Agreements do not have credit-risk-related contingent provisions. Most of the company's outstanding commodity derivatives are listed commodity futures, and the company is required by the relevant commodity exchange to post collateral each day to cover the change in the fair value of these futures. Any non-exchange traded commodity derivatives are covered by the aforementioned ISDA Master Agreements and are subject to the same credit-risk-related contingent provisions, as are the company's interest rate derivatives. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under ISDA Master Agreements that are in a liability position on Nov. 30, 2010, is $47 million, which is the amount that would be required for settlement if the credit-risk-related contingent provisions underlying these agreements were triggered.
Credit Risk Management
Monsanto invests its excess cash in deposits with major banks or money market funds throughout the world in high-quality short-term debt instruments. Such investments are made only in instruments issued or enhanced by high-quality institutions.
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, the company had no financial instruments that represented a significant concentration of credit risk. Limited amounts are invested in any single institution to minimize risk. The company has not incurred any credit risk losses related to those investments.
The company sells a broad range of agricultural products to a diverse group of customers throughout the world. In the United States, the company makes substantial sales to relatively few large wholesale customers. The company's business is highly seasonal, and it is subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices and seed yields. Credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation, and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize the risk of loss. Collateral is secured when it is deemed appropriate by the company.
Monsanto regularly evaluates its business practices to minimize its credit risk. During the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009, the company engaged multiple banks in the United States, Argentina, Brazil and Europe in the development of customer financing options that involve direct bank financing of customer purchases. For further information on these programs, see Note 4  Customer Financing Programs.
NOTE 16. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  PENSIONS, HEALTH CARE AND OTHER
The majority of Monsanto's employees are covered by noncontributory pension plans sponsored by the company. The company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through insurance contracts. The company's net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits, and health care and other postretirement benefits include the following components:
Monsanto has not contributed to its U.S. qualified plan in the three month period ended Nov. 30, 2010, and contributed $75 million to its U.S. qualified plan in the three month period ended Nov. 30, 2009. Monsanto contributed $2 million and $3 million to plans outside the United States in the three month period ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009, respectively. As of Nov. 30, 2010, management expects to make additional contributions of approximately $34 million and $9 million to the company's pension plans in the United States and outside the United States, respectively, during the remainder of fiscal year 2011.
Employee Savings Plan
The Monsanto leveraged employee stock ownership plan (Monsanto ESOP) debt was restructured in November 2008 to level out the future allocation of stock thereunder in an impartial manner intended to ensure equitable treatment for and generally to be in the best interests of current and future plan participants consistent with the level of benefits that Monsanto intended for the plan to provide to participants. To that end, the terms of the restructuring were determined pursuant to an arm's length negotiation between Monsanto and an independent trust company serving as fiduciary for the plan for this restructuring. In
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
this role, the independent fiduciary determined that the restructuring, including certain financial commitments and enhancements that were made or will be made in the future by Monsanto to benefit participants and beneficiaries of the plan, was completed in accordance with the best interests of plan participants. A liability of $56 million is due to the Monsanto ESOP from the company and is included in other liabilities on the Condensed Statements of Financial Position as of both Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, related to this restructuring and the 2004 ESOP enhancement.
NOTE 17. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
The following table shows total stock-based compensation expense included in the Statements of Consolidated Operations for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009. Stock-based compensation cost capitalized in inventory was $7 million and $8 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
During the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, Monsanto granted 3,915,500 stock options and 222,010 restricted stock units to employees under the Monsanto Company Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), as amended, and the Monsanto Company 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2005 LTIP). No restricted stock awards were granted under the LTIP or the 2005 LTIP during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. In addition, during the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, 23,337 shares of deferred stock and 5,649 shares of restricted stock were granted to directors under the Monsanto Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (Director Plan).
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of non-qualified stock options granted during the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, was $19.56 per share. Pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense for stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, was $117 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $56.53 per share. Pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for nonvested restricted stock and restricted stock units was less than $1 million and $62 million, respectively, as of Nov. 30, 2010, which will be recognized as expense over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods. The weighted-average remaining requisite service periods for nonvested restricted stock and restricted stock units were 1.0 year and 2.1 years, respectively, as of Nov. 30, 2010. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of directors' deferred stock and directors' restricted stock granted during the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, was $53.99 per share. Pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense for awards granted under the Director Plan was $1 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of one year.
NOTE 18. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
Comprehensive income (loss) includes all nonshareowner changes in equity. It consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, postretirement benefit plan activity, and net accumulated derivative gains and losses on cash flow hedges not yet realized.

Information regarding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is as follows:
NOTE 19. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) was computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period shown in the table below. The diluted EPS computation takes into account the effect of dilutive potential common shares, as shown in the table below. In the three months ended Nov. 30, 2009, basic loss per share and diluted loss per share were the same because the effect of dilutive potential securities would have been antidilutive as the company generated a loss from continuing operations. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and directors' deferred shares calculated using the treasury stock method and are excluded if their effect is antidilutive. Approximately 11.7 million stock options were excluded from the computations of dilutive potential common shares as they were antidilutive as of Nov. 30, 2010.
NOTE 20. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Cash payments for interest and taxes were as follows:
In third quarter 2010, Monsanto acquired the Chesterfield Village Research Center from Pfizer for $435 million. The seller financed $324 million of this purchase. As of Nov. 30, 2010, $324 million is included in short-term debt on the Condensed Statement of Consolidated Financial Position. See Note 13  Debt and Other Credit Arrangements  for further details.
NOTE 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Monsanto is involved in environmental remediation and legal proceedings related to its current business and, pursuant to its indemnification obligations, related to Pharmacia's former chemical and agricultural businesses. In addition, Monsanto has liabilities established for various product claims. With respect to certain of these proceedings, Monsanto has a liability recorded of $244 million and $255 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively, for the estimated contingent liabilities. Information regarding the environmental liabilities appears in Monsanto's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010.
Environmental and Litigation Liabilities:
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNAUDITED
(continued)
The above liability includes amounts related to certain third-party litigation with respect to Monsanto's business, as well as tort litigation related to Pharmacia's former chemical business, including lawsuits involving polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and other chemical and premises liability litigation. Additional matters that are not reflected in the liability may arise in the future, and Monsanto may manage, settle, or pay judgments or damages with respect thereto in order to mitigate contesting potential liability. Following is a description of one of the more significant litigation matters reflected in the liability.
Litigation:
Including litigation reflected in the liability, Monsanto is involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business or pursuant to Monsanto's indemnification obligations to Pharmacia, as well as proceedings that management has considered to be material under SEC regulations. Some of the lawsuits seek damages in very large amounts, or seek to restrict the company's business activities. Monsanto believes that it has meritorious legal arguments and will continue to represent its interests vigorously in all of the proceedings that it is defending or prosecuting. Although the ultimate liabilities resulting from such proceedings, or the proceedings reflected in the above liability, may be significant to profitability in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on Monsanto's consolidated financial position or liquidity. A description of one of these proceedings appears below.

NOTE 22. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Monsanto conducts its worldwide operations through global businesses, which are aggregated into reportable segments based on similarity of products, production processes, customers, distribution methods and economic characteristics. The operating segments are aggregated into two reportable segments: Seeds and Genomics and Agricultural Productivity. The Seeds and Genomics segment consists of the global seeds and related traits businesses and biotechnology platforms. Within the Seeds and Genomics segment, Monsanto's operating segments to be reported separately are corn seed and traits, soybean seed and traits, cotton seed and traits, vegetable seeds and all other crops seeds and traits. The wheat and sugarcane businesses acquired in fourth and second quarter 2009, respectively, are included in the all other crops seeds and traits operating segment. In February 2011, the company reorganized certain operating segments within our Agricultural Productivity reportable segment as a result of a change in the way the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, evaluates the performance of operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. The "ROUNDUP and other glyphosate-based herbicides" operating segment and the "all other agricultural products" operating segments within Agricultural Productivity were combined into one operating segment titled "Agricultural Productivity" which is now managed as one business representing our weed management platform and supporting our Seeds and Genomics business. The change in operating segments had no impact on the company's reportable segments. The historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation. EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes and is the primary operating performance measure for the two business segments. EBIT is useful to management in demonstrating the operational profitability of the segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis. Sales between segments were not significant. Certain selling, general and administrative expenses are allocated between segments based on activity. Based on the Agricultural Productivity segment's decreasing contribution to total Monsanto operations, the allocation percentages were changed at the beginning of fiscal year 2011.

Data for the Seeds and Genomics and Agricultural Productivity reportable segments, as well as for Monsanto's operating segments to be reported separately, is presented in the table that follows:

NOTE 23. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During fourth quarter 2008, the company determined that the Dairy business was no longer consistent with its strategic business objectives, and thus entered into an agreement to sell the majority of the Dairy business assets (excluding cash, trade receivables and certain property) to Eli Lilly and Company for $300 million, plus additional contingent consideration. The contingent consideration is a 10 year earn-out with potential annual payments being earned by Monsanto if certain revenue levels are exceeded. On Oct. 1, 2008, Monsanto consummated the sale to Eli Lilly after receiving approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies. As a result, the Dairy business has been segregated from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations. The Dairy business was previously reported as a part of the Agricultural Productivity segment. During the three months ended Nov. 30, 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses included a $5 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of assets.

NOTE 24. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On Dec. 6, 2010, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on the company's common stock of 28 cents per share. The dividend is payable on Jan. 28, 2011, to shareowners of record on Jan. 7, 2011.

Exhibit 99.2
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Background
Monsanto Company, along with its subsidiaries, is a leading global provider of agricultural products for farmers. Our seeds, biotechnology trait products, and herbicides provide farmers with solutions that improve productivity, reduce the costs of farming, and produce better foods for consumers and better feed for animals.
We manage our business in two segments: Seeds and Genomics and Agricultural Productivity. Through our Seeds and Genomics segment, we produce leading seed brands, including DEKALB, ASGROW, DELTAPINE, SEMINIS and DE RUITERand we develop biotechnology traits that assist farmers in controlling insects and weeds. We also provide other seed companies with genetic material and biotechnology traits for their seed brands. Through our Agricultural Productivity segment, we manufacture ROUNDUP and HARNESS brand herbicides and other herbicides.
,
In the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement to divest the Dairy business. This transaction was consummated on Oct. 1, 2008. As a result, financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Accordingly, the Statements of Consolidated Operations have been conformed to this presentation. The Dairy business was previously reported as part of the Agricultural Productivity segment. See Note 23  Discontinued Operations  for further details.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with Monsanto's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. This Report on Form 10-Q should also be read in conjunction with Monsanto's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010. Financial information for the first three months of fiscal year 2011 should not be annualized because of the seasonality of our business. The notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to throughout this MD&A are included in Part I  Item 1  Financial Statements  of this Report on Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise indicated, "Monsanto," the "company," "we," "our" and "us" are used interchangeably to refer to Monsanto Company or to Monsanto Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, as appropriate to the context. Unless otherwise indicated, "earnings (loss) per share" and "per share" mean diluted earnings (loss) per share. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts and analyses are based on continuing operations. Unless otherwise indicated, trademarks owned or licensed by Monsanto or its subsidiaries are shown in all capital letters. Unless otherwise indicated, references to "ROUNDUP herbicides" mean ROUNDUP branded herbicides, excluding all lawn-and-garden herbicides, and references to "ROUNDUP and other glyphosate-based herbicides" exclude all lawn-and-garden herbicides.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as two other financial measures, EBIT and free cash flow, that are considered "non-GAAP financial measures." Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of EBIT and free cash flow information is intended to supplement investors' understanding of our operating performance and liquidity. Our EBIT and free cash flow measures may not be comparable to other companies' EBIT and free cash flow measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace net income, cash flows, financial position, or comprehensive income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes. Earnings is intended to mean net income (loss) as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations under GAAP. EBIT is the primary operating performance measure for our two business segments. We believe that EBIT is useful to investors and management to demonstrate the operational profitability of our segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the measures used by Monsanto management to determine resource allocations within the company. See Note 22  Segment Information  for a reconciliation of EBIT to net income (loss) for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009.
 
We also provide information regarding free cash flow, an important liquidity measure for Monsanto. We define free cash flow as the total of net cash provided or required by operating activities and provided or required by investing activities. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. This cash can be used to meet business needs and obligations, to reinvest in the company for future growth, or to return to our shareowners through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow is also used by management as one of the performance measures in determining incentive compensation. See the "Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources  Cash Flow" section of MD&A for a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided (required) by operating activities and net cash required by investing activities on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
Executive Summary
 Net sales increased $133 million, or eight percent, in the three-month comparison. This increase was primarily a result of increased sales of cotton and corn seed and traits in Australia and Argentina, respectively. Net income in first quarter 2011 was income of $0.01 per share, compared with a loss of $0.03 per share in first quarter 2010.
Consolidated Operating Results
 In first quarter 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $624 million, compared with net cash required of $1,403 million in the prior-year quarter. Net cash required by investing activities was $124 million in first quarter 2011 compared with $197 million in first quarter 2010. Free cash flow was $500 million in first quarter 2011 compared with a negative $1,600 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase is primarily because of a shift in the timing of the U.S. prepay program in first quarter 2011 compared to first quarter 2010 and an increase in collections.
Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources
 We plan to continue to improve our products in order to maintain market leadership and to support near-term performance. We are focused on applying innovation and technology to make our farmer customers more productive and profitable by protecting yields and improving the ways they can produce food, fiber and feed. We use the tools of modern biology to make seeds easier to grow, to allow farmers to do more with fewer resources, and to produce healthier foods for consumers. Our current research and development (R&D) strategy and commercial priorities are focused on bringing our farmer customers second- and third-generation traits, on delivering multiple solutions in one seed ("stacking"), and on developing new pipeline products. Our capabilities in biotechnology and breeding research are generating a rich product pipeline that is expected to drive long-term growth. The viability of our product pipeline depends in part on the speed of regulatory approvals globally, and on continued patent and legal rights to offer our products.
Outlook
We plan to improve and to grow our vegetable seeds business. We have applied our molecular breeding and marker capabilities to our library of vegetable germplasm. In the future, we will continue to focus on accelerating the potential growth of this business and executing our business plans.
ROUNDUP herbicides remain the largest crop protection brand globally. Following a period of increasing inventories within the global glyphosate market and expansion of global glyphosate production capacity, the market has moved to an oversupply position. As a result, the significant supply of lower-priced generics has caused increased competitive pressure in the market and a decline in the business. We are focused on managing the costs associated with our agricultural chemistry business as that sector matures globally.
See the "Outlook" section of MD&A for a more detailed discussion of some of the opportunities and risks we have identified for our business. For additional information related to the outlook for Monsanto, see "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Report on Form 10-Q, Part II  Item 1A  Risk Factors below and Part I  Item 1A of our Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2011
The following explanations discuss the significant components of our results of operations that affected the quarter-to-quarter comparison of our first quarter income from continuing operations:
increased 8 percent in first quarter 2011 from the same quarter a year ago. Our Seeds and Genomics segment net sales increased 13 percent, and our Agricultural Productivity segment net sales remained flat. The following table presents the percentage changes in first quarter 2011 worldwide net sales by segment compared with net sales in the prior-year
Net sales
 
quarter, including the effect volume, price, currency and acquisitions had on these percentage changes:
 
For a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting the net sales comparison, see the "Seeds and Genomics Segment" and the "Agricultural Productivity Segment" sections.
increased 11 percent in the three-month comparison. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross profit percentage) for the total company increased one percentage point to 45 percent in first quarter 2011 primarily driven by the increase in cotton and corn seed and trait sales. Gross profit percentage in the Seed and Genomics Segment remained flat at 58 percent in first quarter 2011. See the "Seeds and Genomics Segment" section of MD&A for details. Gross profit percentage for the Agricultural Productivity segment remained flat at 21 percent in first quarter 2011. See the "Agricultural Productivity Segment" section of the MD&A for the factors affecting the Agricultural Productivity gross profit.
Gross profit
decreased 2 percent, or $17 million, in first quarter 2011 from the prior-year comparable quarter. In the three-month comparison, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 9 percent primarily because of lower headcount and timing of spending for marketing and administrative functions. R&D expenses increased 13 percent as we manage more projects in the latter phases of the development cycle. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased four percentage points to 25, and R&D expenses increased one percentage point to 17 percent.
Operating expenses
was expense of $12 million in first quarter 2011, compared with income of $12 million in the prior-year quarter. The change occurred due to increased foreign currency losses in the current year and the gain recorded on the Seminium acquisition in the prior year.
Other expense (income)  net
was $6 million in first quarter 2011, an increase of $36 million over the prior-year quarter primarily as a result of the increase in pretax income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent from 56 percent in first quarter 2010. First quarter 2010 included several discrete tax adjustments resulting in a tax benefit of $16 million. The majority of this benefit resulted from the expiration of statutes in several jurisdictions and the resolution of an ex-U.S. audit. In addition, the effective tax rate for first quarter 2010 was affected by restructuring charges in low tax rate jurisdictions. Without these items, our effective tax rate for first quarter 2011 would have been comparable to the 2010 rate.
Income tax provision (benefit)
On Dec. 17, 2010, the retroactive extension of the research and development credit was enacted as part of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this legislation. We expect to record a discrete benefit in second quarter 2011 for the prior-year period impact and we expect to record the current year benefit throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2011 as a decrease in the annual effective tax rate.
 
SEEDS AND GENOMICS SEGMENT
 
Seeds and Genomics Financial Performance  First Quarter Fiscal Year 2011
Net sales of corn seed and traits increased eight percent, or $45 million, in the three-month comparison, primarily driven by higher volumes in Argentina due to increased planted area and a higher price due to a shift in mix. The increase is also driven by incremental sales from the Seminium acquisition.
Cotton seed and traits net sales increased 90 percent, or $53 million, in the three-month comparison, primarily because of increased acres, higher cotton commodity prices and favorable weather conditions in Australia.
The net sales increases discussed throughout this section resulted in $82 million higher gross profit in first quarter 2011. Gross profit as a percent of sales for this segment remained flat at 58 percent in the quarter-over-quarter comparison.
EBIT for the Seeds and Genomics segment increased $37 million to a loss of $20 million in first quarter 2011.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY SEGMENT
NM = Not Meaningful
 
 
Agricultural Productivity Financial Performance  First Quarter Fiscal Year 2011
Net sales of Agricultural Productivity remained flat in the three-month comparison. Sales volumes of ROUNDUP and other glyphosate-based herbicides increased 13 percent in first quarter 2011 from first quarter 2010. Offsetting this increase, the average net selling price for ROUNDUP and other glyphosate-based herbicides decreased in most regions in first quarter 2011 compared to first quarter 2010 due to previously announced price decreases on our products.
The net sales discussed throughout this section resulted in $3 million lower gross profit in first quarter 2011. Gross profit as a percent of sales for the Agricultural Productivity segment remained flat at 21 percent in first quarter 2011. The average net selling price decrease was offset by an improvement in cost of goods sold because of better throughput cost due to increased capacity in our U.S. facilities for ROUNDUP and other glyphosate-based herbicides. EBIT for the Agricultural Productivity segment increased $26 million to $60 million in first quarter 2011.
RESTRUCTURING
Restructuring charges were recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Operations as follows:
 
On June 23, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (2009 Restructuring Plan) to take future actions to reduce costs in light of the changing market supply environment for glyphosate. These actions are designed to enable us to stabilize the Agricultural Productivity business and allow it to deliver optimal gross profit and a sustainable level of operating cash in the coming years, while better aligning spending and working capital needs. We also announced that we will take steps to better align the resources of our global seeds and traits business. These actions include certain product and brand rationalization within our seed businesses. On Sept. 9, 2009, we committed to take additional actions related to the previously announced restructuring plan. Furthermore, while implementing the plan, we identified additional opportunities to better align our resources, and on Aug. 26, 2010, committed to take additional actions. The plan was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, and the remaining payments will be made by the end of the fourth quarter in fiscal year 2011.
The total restructuring costs are now expected to be $750 million and were substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2011. The charges are expected to be comprised of approximately $350 million to $360 million in severance and related benefits, $155 million of costs related to facility closures and exit costs and $235 million of asset impairments. Payments related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan will be generated from cash from operations.
The following table displays the pretax charges of $7 million and $14 million incurred by segment under the 2009 Restructuring Plan for the first quarters ended Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009, respectively, as well as the cumulative
 
pretax charges of $737 million under the 2009 Restructuring Plan.
Our written human resource policies are indicative of an ongoing benefit arrangement with respect to severance packages. Benefits paid pursuant to an ongoing benefit arrangement are specifically excluded from the Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations topic of the ASC, therefore severance charges incurred in connection with the 2009 Restructuring Plan are accounted for when probable and estimable as required under the Compensation  Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits topic of the ASC. In addition, when the decision to commit to a restructuring plan requires an asset impairment review, Monsanto evaluates such impairment issues under the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the ASC.
In first quarter 2011, pretax restructuring charges of $7 million were recorded. The facility closures/ exit costs of $25 million relate primarily to the finalization of the termination of a corn toller contract in the United States. In workforce reductions, approximately $7 million of additional charges were offset by $25 million of reversals. Although positions originally included in the plan were eliminated, individuals found new roles within the company due to attrition. In first quarter 2010, pretax restructuring charges of $14 million were recorded, primarily relating to work force reductions in Europe.
The actions related to the overall restructuring plan are expected to produce annual cost savings of $300 million to $340 million, primarily in cost of goods sold and SG&A. Approximately one-fourth of these savings were recognized in fiscal year 2010, with the full benefit expected to be realized in 2011.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Working Capital and Financial Condition
 
: Working capital decreased $59 million between Aug. 31, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2010, because of the following factors:
Nov. 30, 2010, compared with Aug. 31, 2010
These decreases to working capital between Aug. 31, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2010, were offset by the following factors:
: Working capital decreased $555 million between Nov. 30, 2010, and Nov. 30, 2009. The following factors decreased working capital as of Nov. 30, 2010, compared with Nov. 30, 2009:
Nov. 30, 2010, compared with Nov. 30, 2009
 
These working capital decreases were partially offset by the following factor:
: We participate in a revolving financing program in Brazil that allows us to transfer up to 1 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $585 million) in customers in Brazil to a special purpose entity, formerly a qualified special purpose entity. Third parties, primarily investment funds, hold an 88 percent senior interest in the entity, and we hold the remaining 12 percent interest. Under the arrangement, a recourse provision requires us to cover the first 12 percent of credit losses within the program. We have evaluated our relationship with the entity under updated guidance within the Consolidation topic of the ASC and, as a result, the entity has been consolidated effective Sept. 1, 2010. For further information, see Note 5  Variable Interest Entities.
Customer Financing Programs
As of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively, there were $1 million and $3 million of receivables sold through this financing program that were delinquent. Based on our historical collection experience with these customers and a current assessment of credit exposure, we recorded our recourse provision at $5 million as of Aug. 31, 2010, and we recorded a bad debt allowance related to these receivables of $2 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The maximum potential amount of exposure under the program was $13 million and $15 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. If we are called upon to make payments under the recourse provision, we would have the benefit under the financing program of any amounts subsequently collected from the customer.
We have an agreement in the United States to sell customer receivables up to a maximum of $500 million and to service such accounts. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under the Transfers and Servicing topic of the ASC and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The gross amount of receivables sold totaled $3 million and $2 million for the first three months of fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. The agreement includes recourse provisions and thus a liability was established at the time of sale that approximates fair value based upon our historical collection experience with such receivables and a current assessment of credit exposure. The recourse liability recorded by us was $2 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the recourse provisions of the agreement was $7 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The outstanding balance of the receivables sold was $138 million and $223 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. There were delinquent accounts of $2 million and $3 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
We sell accounts receivable in the United States, European regions and Argentina both with and without recourse. These sales qualify for sales treatment under the Transfers and Servicing topic of the ASC and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The gross amounts of accounts receivable sold totaled $1 million and $13 million for the first three months of 2011 and 2010, respectively. The liability for the guarantees for sales with recourse is recorded at an amount that approximates fair value, based on our historical collection experience for the customers associated with the sales of the accounts receivable and a current assessment of credit exposure. Our guarantee liability was less than $1 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the recourse provisions of the agreements was $42 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The outstanding balance of the receivables sold was $64 million and $91 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
We also have agreements with lenders to establish programs to provide financing of up to 550 million Brazilian reais (approximately $320 million) for selected customers in Brazil. The amount of loans outstanding was $60 million and $100 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. In this program, we provide a guarantee of the loans in the event of customer default. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was $60 million as of
 
Nov. 30, 2010. The liability for the guarantee is recorded at an amount that approximates fair value, primarily based on our historical collection experience with customers that participate in the program and a current assessment of credit exposure. Our guarantee liability was $1 million and $3 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. If performance is required under the guarantee, we may retain amounts that are subsequently collected from customers.
We also have similar agreements with banks that provide financing to our customers in the United States, Brazil, Europe and Argentina. The amount of loans outstanding was $78 million and $36 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively. We provide a guarantee of the loans in the event of customer default. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was $76 million as of Nov. 30, 2010. The liability for the guarantee is recorded at an amount that approximates fair value, primarily based on our historical collection experience with customers that participate in the program and a current assessment of credit exposure. Our guarantee liability was $1 million and $2 million as of Nov. 30, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2010, respectively.
Cash Flow
 
Cash provided by operating activities was $624 million in first quarter 2011 compared with cash required by operating activities of $1,403 million in first quarter 2010. Cash provided by operating activities increased $2,027 million in first quarter 2011, primarily because of a shift in timing of the U.S. prepay program this year. This caused an increase in deferred revenue and a source of cash from trade receivables. Further contributing to the increase in operating activities, accounts payable and accrued liabilities used less cash during the three months ended Nov. 30, 2010, primarily due to the high level of customer refunds paid in the first quarter of the prior year.
Cash required by investing activities was $124 million in first quarter 2011 compared to cash required of $197 million in first quarter 2010. Our capital expenditures decreased $67 million in the three-month comparison, to $125 million.
The amount of cash required by financing activities was $340 million in first quarter 2011 compared with a source of cash of $102 million in first quarter 2010. The net change in short-term financing was a source of cash of $71 million in first quarter 2011 compared with a source of cash of $295 million in the prior-year quarter primarily due to the commercial paper borrowings during the prior year quarter. Further, treasury stock purchases increased $203 million as we increased our repurchase of shares compared to the same period in the prior year.
 
Capital Resources and Liquidity
A major source of our liquidity is operating cash flows, which are derived from net income. This cash-generating capability provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating, investing and financing needs. To the extent that cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to fund our cash needs, which generally occurs during the first and third quarters of the fiscal year because of the seasonal nature of our business, short-term commercial paper borrowings are used to finance these requirements. Although the commercial paper market has not fully returned to historical levels, the market is available to those companies with high short-term credit ratings such as Monsanto. We anticipate accessing the commercial paper markets in 2011 for short periods of time to finance working capital needs and do not believe our options will be limited. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at Nov. 30, 2010.
Total debt outstanding increased $117 million between Nov. 30, 2009, and Nov. 30, 2010, primarily because we acquired the Chesterfield Village Research Center in April 2010 for $435 million of which $111 million was paid in fiscal year 2010 and $324 million is included within short-term debt as of Nov. 30, 2010. This increase was offset by lower commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of Nov. 30, 2010.
We plan to issue new fixed-rate debt on or before Aug. 15, 2012, to repay $484 million of 7 % Senior Notes that are due on Aug. 15, 2012. In March 2009, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $250 million. In August 2010, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million. Our purpose was to hedge the variability of the forecasted interest payments on this expected debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate until the debt is issued.
We plan to issue additional fixed-rate debt on or before April 15, 2011. In July 2010, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $300 million. Our purpose was to hedge the variability of the forecasted interest payments on this expected debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued.
: In December 2010, we declared a quarterly dividend of 28 cents payable on Jan. 28, 2011, to shareowners of record as of Jan. 7, 2011.
Dividend
: We expect 2011 capital expenditures to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million compared with $755 million in 2010. The primary driver of this decrease is lower spending on projects to expand corn seed production facilities and R&D facilities compared to prior year.
Capital Expenditures
In April 2010, we acquired a corn and soybean processing plant located in Paine, Chile from Anasac, a Santiago-based company that provides seed processing services. The total cash paid and the fair value of the acquisition were $34 million, and the purchase price was primarily allocated to fixed assets, goodwill, and intangibles.
2010 Acquisitions:
In October 2009, we acquired the remaining 51 percent equity interest in Seminium, S.A. (Seminium), a leading Argentinean corn seed company. The total fair value of Seminium was $36 million. This fair value includes $20 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) and $16 million for the fair value of Monsanto's 49 percent equity interest in Seminium held prior to the acquisition.
: There have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations table as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Aug. 31, 2010.
2011 Contractual Obligations
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
Under our Separation Agreement with Pharmacia, we are required to indemnify Pharmacia for certain matters, such as environmental remediation obligations and litigation. To the extent we are currently managing any such matters, we evaluate them in the course of managing our own potential liabilities and establish reserves as appropriate. However, additional matters may arise in the future, and we may manage, settle or pay judgments or damages with respect to those matters in order to mitigate contingent liability and protect Pharmacia and Monsanto. See Note 21  Commitments and Contingencies and Part II  Item 1  Legal Proceedings  for further information.
We have entered into various customer financing programs which are accounted for in accordance with the Transfers and Servicing topic of the ASC. See Note 4  Customer Financing Programs  for further information.
OUTLOOK
We believe we have achieved an industry-leading position in the areas in which we compete in both of our business segments. However, the outlook for each part of our business is quite different. In the Seeds and Genomics segment, our seeds and traits business is expected to expand via our investment in new products. In the Agricultural Productivity segment, we expect to deliver competitive products in a more stable business.
We believe that our company is positioned to deliver value-added products to growers enabling us to grow our gross profit in the future. We expect to see strong cash flow in the future, and we remain committed to returning value to shareowners through vehicles such as investments that expand the business, dividends and share repurchases. We will remain focused on cost and cash management for each segment, both to support the progress we have made in managing our investment in working capital and to realize the full earnings potential of our businesses. We plan to continue to seek additional external financing opportunities for our customers as a way to manage receivables for each of our segments.
Economic activity in the United States and globally appears to be recovering from the slowdown seen in fiscal year 2009, though credit availability is still restrained. Outside of the United States, our businesses will continue to face additional challenges related to the risks inherent in operating in emerging markets. We expect to continue to monitor these developments and the challenges and issues they place on our business. We believe we have taken appropriate measures to manage our credit exposure, which has the potential to affect sales negatively in the near term. In addition, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our profitability, the book value of our assets outside the United States, and our shareowners' equity.
Seeds and Genomics
Our capabilities in plant breeding and biotechnology research are generating a rich and balanced product pipeline that we expect will drive long-term growth. We plan to continue to invest in the areas of seeds, genomics and biotechnology and to invest in technology arrangements that have the potential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our R&D efforts. We believe that our seeds and traits businesses will have significant near-term growth opportunities through a combination of improved breeding and continued growth of stacked and second-generation biotech traits.
We expect advanced breeding techniques combined with improved production practices and capital investments will continue to contribute to improved germplasm quality and yields for our seed offerings, leading to increased global demand for both our branded germplasm and our licensed germplasm. Our vegetable portfolio is focused on 23 crops. We plan to continue applying our molecular breeding and marker capabilities to our vegetable seeds germplasm, which we expect will lead to business growth. The business integration into a global platform along with a number of process improvements has improved our abilities to develop and deliver new, innovative products to our broad customer base. The acquisition of Aly Participacoes Ltda. will enable us to combine our areas of breeding expertise to enhance yields in sugarcane, a crop that is vital to addressing growing global food and fuel demands. We also plan to continue making strategic acquisitions in our seed businesses to grow our branded seed market share, expand our germplasm library and strengthen our global breeding programs. We expect to see continued competition in seeds and genomics. We believe we will have a competitive advantage
 
because of our global breeding capabilities and our multiple-channel sales approach in the United States for corn and soybean seeds.
Commercialization of second- and third-generation traits and the stacking of multiple traits in corn and cotton are expected to increase penetration in approved markets, particularly as we continue to price our traits in line with the value growers have experienced. In 2010, we saw higher-value, stacked-trait products representing a larger share of our total U.S. corn seed sales than they did in 2009. We experienced an increase in competition in biotechnology as more competitors launched traits in the United States and internationally. Acquisitions may also present mid to longer term opportunities to increase penetration of our traits. We believe our competitive position continues to enable us to deliver second- and third-generation traits when our competitors are delivering their first-generation traits.
Key regulatory approvals were obtained for the 2010 commercial launch of our next generation corn product. GENUITY SMARTSTAX, a product that contains five proteins that control important above ground (corn borer, corn ear worm) and below ground (corn root worm) pests and provides tolerance to the herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate, uses multiple modes of action for insect control, the proven means to enhance performance, reduce structured refuge and maintain long-term durability of corn trait technology. GENUITY SMARTSTAX uniquely features a combination of weed and insect control traits that significantly reduces the risk of resistance for both above and below ground pests. As a result, the U.S. EPA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency allowed reduction of the typical structured farm refuge from 20 percent to 5 percent for GENUITY SMARTSTAX in the U.S. Corn Belt and Canada and from 50 percent to 20 percent for the U.S. Cotton Belt. GENUITY SMARTSTAX corn was launched in the United States in 2010.
Full regulatory submissions were completed for a 5 percent refuge-in-a-bag (RIB) seed blend to the U.S. EPA for GENUITY SMARTSTAX and GENUITY VT DOUBLE PRO. GENUITY SMARTSTAX and VT DOUBLE PRO RIB would provide a single bag solution to enable farmers in the Corn Belt to plant corn without a separate refuge.
We have recently received Brazilian National Technical Biosafety Committee approval for BT ROUNDUP READY 2 YIELD soybeans, which is an important step toward commercialization of the first biotechnology trait developed specifically for a non-US market. Key import submissions are under regulatory review. Other global cultivation opportunities were also expanded for corn and cotton with approval of GENUITY VT TRIPLE PRO in Argentina, YIELDGARD VT PRO and GENUITY VT DOUBLE PRO in South Africa, BOLLGARD II Cotton in Brazil and corn field trials in Mexico, Vietnam and Pakistan.
During 2007, we announced a long-term joint R&D and commercialization collaboration in plant biotechnology with BASF that will focus on high-yielding crops and crops that are tolerant to adverse conditions such as drought. We have completed all North American and key import country regulatory submissions for the first biotech drought-tolerant corn product. Pending necessary approvals, we expect to move to on-farm testing plots with growers around 2012 to obtain on-farm data. Over the long-term life of the collaboration, we and BASF will dedicate a joint budget of potentially $2.5 billion to fund a dedicated pipeline of yield and stress tolerance traits for corn, soybeans, cotton, canola and wheat.
Our international traits businesses, in particular, will continue to face unpredictable regulatory environments that may be highly politicized. We operate in volatile, and often difficult, economic environments. Although we see growth potential in our India cotton business with the ongoing conversion to higher planting rates with hybrids and BOLLGARD II, this business is currently operating under state governmental pricing directives that we believe limit near-term earnings potential in India.
In Brazil, notwithstanding continuing and varied legal challenges by private and governmental parties, we expect to continue to operate our dual-track business model of certified seeds and our point-of-delivery payment system (ROUNDUP READY soybeans) or our indemnification collection system (BOLLGARD cotton) to ensure that we capture value on all of our ROUNDUP READY soybeans and BOLLGARD cotton crops grown there. Income is expected to grow as farmers choose to plant more of these approved traits. Although Brazilian law clearly states that these products protected by pipeline patents have the duration of the U.S. patent (2014 for ROUNDUP READY soybeans and 2011 for BOLLGARD cotton), legal rulings have not consistently achieved that outcome. Continued commercial approval of new products such as the recently approved VT DOUBLE PRO, YIELDGARD VT PRO, YIELDGARD ROUNDUP READY 2, YIELDGARD Corn Borer and BT ROUNDUP READY 2 YIELD soybeans will provide the opportunity for a step change in contributions from seeds and traits in Brazil. As noted above, YIELDGARD Corn Borer and YIELDGARD VT PRO were approved recently, and were planted in the recent growing seasons. The agricultural economy in Brazil could be impacted by global commodity prices, particularly for corn and soybeans. We continue to maintain our strict credit policy, expand our grain-based collection
 
system, and focus on cash collection and sales, as part of a continuous effort to manage our Brazilian risk against such volatility.
Efforts to secure an orderly system in Argentina to support the introduction of new technology products are underway. We do not plan to collect on first generation ROUNDUP READY soybeans and we do not plan to commercialize new soybean or cotton traits in Argentina until we can achieve more certainty that we will be compensated for providing the technology. In December 2010, following growers planting more than half of the Northern provinces of Argentina signing a contractual agreement to pay for each use of new BT ROUNDUP READY 2 Yield soybeans (if they choose to plant the technology), Monsanto submitted the regulatory dossier for a planting approval in Argentina. More growers and grain handler agreements will be essential prior to a launch in the Northern provinces. We have no certainty these discussions will lead to an income producing outcome.
In March 2008, a judge of the French Supreme Administrative court (Conseil d'Etat) rejected an application for interim relief by French farmers, French grower associations and various companies, including Monsanto, to overturn the French government's suspension of planting of YIELDGARD Corn Borer pending review and completion under a new regulatory regime. The outcome means that there will be no additional sales or planting of this product in France during the forthcoming growing season. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued an opinion that the French suspension is not supported on a scientific basis. The case has now been referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the ban remains in place. On April 17, 2009, Germany undertook a procedural action under European law and banned the planting of YIELDGARD Corn Borer. We sought interim relief to overturn the ban which the German administrative courts denied. As a result, there will be no sales or planting of MON810 products in Germany this growing season. The court proceedings are postponed pending the outcome of administrative proceedings. Other European Union Member States (e.g., Austria, Luxembourg and Greece) have also invoked procedural measures but we have focused our legal challenges to those countries with significant corn plantings.
Agricultural Productivity
Our Agricultural Productivity gross profit peaked in 2008, declined slightly in 2009 and declined significantly in 2010. The structural changes that have occurred in the global glyphosate market, including oversupply and overcapacity at the manufacturing level, have created a significant compression in the manufacturer's margin. We believe this structural change is permanent and will therefore have a long term impact on the level of profits and cash generated by this business. While we expect the business to continue to be cash positive, we have oriented the focus of Monsanto's agricultural productivity business to strategically support Monsanto's ROUNDUP READY crops through our weed management platform that delivers compelling weed control offerings for farmers.
We have submitted a mine plan to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regarding a new phosphate ore mine near Soda Springs, Idaho, that we intend to use to meet existing and future production demands for our ROUNDUP herbicides and licensed glyphosate. BLM is in the process of finalizing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the mine. We anticipate receiving regulatory approvals for our new mine in fiscal year 2011. However, we are aware that certain environmental groups have initiated litigation against other phosphate producers to disrupt and delay the permitting process.
Other Information
As discussed in Note 21  Commitments and Contingencies and Part II  Item 1  Legal Proceedings, Monsanto is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims relating to a variety of issues. Many of these lawsuits relate to intellectual property disputes. We expect that such disputes will continue to occur as the agricultural biotechnology industry evolves. Third parties, including non-governmental organizations, have challenged the validity or enforceability of patents issued to the company regarding our biotechnology products. For additional information related to the outlook for Monsanto, see "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Report on Form 10-Q, Part II  Item 1A  Risk Factors below and Part I  Item 1A of our Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements, we must select and apply various accounting policies. Our most significant policies are described in Part II  Item 8  Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements
 
contained in our Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010. In order to apply our accounting policies, we often need to make estimates based on judgments about future events. In making such estimates, we rely on historical experience, market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. However, by its nature the estimation process is uncertain, given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control. If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity may be affected materially. In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions, either of which may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
The estimates that have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments are outlined in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2010. Had we used estimates different from any of those contained in such Report on Form 10-K, our financial condition, profitability, or liquidity for the current period could have been materially different from those presented in this Form 10-Q.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In July 2010, the FASB issued a new update that requires enhanced disclosures regarding credit quality and the related allowance for credit losses of financing receivables. The new disclosures will require additional information for nonaccrual and past due accounts, the allowance for credit losses, impaired loans, credit quality, and account modifications. Accordingly, we will include the new disclosure requirements as of the end of the reporting period beginning in second quarter 2011, and the disclosures related to activities during the reporting period beginning in our third quarter 2011. We are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of including this update on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the ASC. This amendment requires disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. It also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This amendment was effective for periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Accordingly, we prospectively adopted this amendment in third quarter 2010, and adopted the additional Level 3 requirements in fiscal year 2011. See Note 14  Fair Value Measurements  for the new disclosures.
In June 2009, the FASB issued a standard that requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2009. Accordingly, we adopted this standard on Sept. 1, 2010. See Note 5  Variable Interest Entities  for the disclosures required by this standard.
In June 2009, the FASB issued a standard that removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) from GAAP and removes the exception from applying consolidation principles to a QSPE. This standard also clarifies the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2009. Accordingly, we adopted this standard in first quarter fiscal year 2011. See Note 4  Customer Financing Programs  for additional discussion regarding the impact on our QSPE related to a Brazilian financing program and other financing programs.
