As Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the           respective Pricing Agreements hereinafter described.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     From time to time Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a "Pricing Agreement"), substantially in the form of Exhibit I attached hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities").
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2002, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Indenture").
Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated

Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the Registration Statement, as defined below) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of electronic communications or other transmission method satisfactory to the Company and the Representatives. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
     At or prior to the time of the first agreement by an Underwriter for the sale of Designated Securities, which time is indicated on Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement (the "Time of Sale"), the Company will prepare the Time of Sale Information (as defined below) for such offering of Securities. "Time of Sale Information" means (i) the Preliminary Prospectus (as defined below) used most recently prior to the Time of Sale, (ii) the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act, (the "Pricing Term Sheet") in the form of Schedule IV to the Pricing Agreement, (iii) the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below), if any, identified in Schedule III to the Pricing Agreement, and (iv) any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Time of Sale Information.
The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that, as of the date of this Agreement:

     (f) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, in the Prospectus and in the Time of Sale Information, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, in the Prospectus or in the Time of Sale Information, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

          (i) will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, other than such as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Designated Securities or the legal authority of the Company to comply with the Designated Securities, the Indenture, the Agreement or any Pricing Agreement;

For purposes of this section, "patent and proprietary rights" shall mean patents, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures, trademarks, service marks and trade names.
 
     (s) Except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Principal Subsidiaries is in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, policy or rule of common law or any judicial or administrative interpretation thereof including any judicial or administrative order, consent, decree or judgment, relating to pollution or protection of human health, the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata) or wildlife, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to the release or threatened release of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, hazardous substances, petroleum or petroleum products (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") or to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Principal Subsidiaries fails to possess any permit, authorization or approval required under any applicable Environmental Laws or to be in compliance with their requirements.

The Company and its subsidiaries have carried out evaluations of the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act and concluded, as of the most recent evaluation date required by the Exchange Act, that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the objectives described above.
     (w) The Company and its subsidiaries maintain systems of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, "Internal Control Over Financial Reporting") that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act and have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
 
accounting principles, including policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     (z) Except as disclosed in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale of Information and except for any claims of prior violations which have been resolved, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor, to the best knowledge and belief of the officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, any director, officer, agent, employee or affiliate of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is aware of or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a violation by such persons of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "FCPA"), including, without limitation, making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any "foreign official" (as such term is defined in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any

     (g) To prepare and deliver to the Representatives or any such other broker-dealer that is required to deliver a prospectus in connection with sales of any Securities at any time nine months or more after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, upon the request of the Representatives but at the expense of the Underwriters or such other brokers, as the case may be, as many copies as the Representatives may request of any such amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, Time of Sale Information or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

          (iii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject, other than as set forth in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information and other than those which individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities;
          (iv) The Designated Securities have been duly authorized by the Company; assuming (a) that they have been duly signed by the manual or facsimile signatures of officers (specified in such opinion) of the Company (provided that counsel shall not make the assumption in this clause (a) with respect to Designated Securities that are global securities), and (b) that the Designated Securities have been duly authenticated by the Trustee under the Indenture, the Designated Securities have been duly executed, issued and delivered by the Company and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture and are enforceable in accordance with its terms except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; and the Designated Securities and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information;

          (vii) The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute or result in a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other similar agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, other than such as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Designated Securities or the legal authority of the Company to comply with the Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement; nor will such actions result in a violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-laws of the Company; nor will any such action result in a violation of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body in the United States having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties other than such as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Designated Securities or the legal authority of the Company to comply with the Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement (except to the extent that the issue and sale of the Designated Securities as contemplated by this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement and the distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters may result in violations of state securities or Blue Sky laws); and except as set forth in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any such regulatory authority or other governmental body in the United States having jurisdiction over the Company is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters;
          (viii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be,
 
complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
          (ix) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and the information included in the Registration Statement in response to Item 10 (insofar as it relates to such counsel) of Form S-3 is to the best of such counsel's knowledge an accurate statement of the matter therein set forth and fairly presents the information called for with respect to that matter by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;
          (x) The Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act; any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, any required filing of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433 and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act have been initiated or are pending or threatened by the Commission; and
          (xi) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
     Such counsel may also state that such counsel has not verified, and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, other than those mentioned in subparagraph (viii) above, but such counsel shall confirm that such counsel has, however, participated in reviews and discussions in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery, and that in the course of such reviews and discussions no facts came to such counsel's attention which led such counsel to believe (A) that the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) that the Prospectus includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (C) that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any belief as to the financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information or omitted therefrom or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
     In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel may rely upon opinions of local counsel (which may include counsel for the Representatives) satisfactory in form and scope to counsel for the Representatives.
          (d) At the date hereof and at the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type referred to in AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72 (or any successor standard thereto).
          (e) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (including any amendments or supplements prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities) and the Time of Sale Information, there shall not have been any material decrease in the outstanding capital stock (other than changes in treasury stock within limits, or pursuant to employee plans, disclosed or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information), or any material increase in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, financial position, shareowners' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information (including the documents incorporated by reference therein), the effect of which is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information.
          (f) On or after the earlier of (A) the Time of Sale and (B) the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Securities or any other debt securities or preferred stock of or guaranteed by the Company by Fitch Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
          (g) On or after the earlier of (A) the Time of Sale and (B) the execution of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following events, the effect of which on the financial markets in each case, in the judgment of the Representatives, is such as to make it impracticable or inadvisable for the Underwriters to
 
proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Designated Securities in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information: (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by federal or New York State authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; (iv) any calamity or crisis within or without the United States affecting U.S. or international financial markets; or (v) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
          (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery and as to the performance by the Company in all material respects of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, and the Company also shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the matters set forth in subsection (a) of this Section.
          (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(d) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses.
9. Indemnification.
          (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which any such person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse (within a reasonable time after the same is incurred, and subject to a right to audit) each such indemnified person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such
 
Securities. Each Underwriter acknowledges that the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) does not extend to any liability which such Underwriter might have under Section 5(b) of the Securities Act by reason of the fact that such Underwriter sold Designated Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or any amendment or supplement relating thereto (excluding documents incorporated by reference), as the case may be, if the Company has made available copies thereof to such Underwriter.
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse (within a reasonable time after the same is incurred, and subject to a right to audit) each such indemnified person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, and in the event that such indemnified party shall not so notify the indemnifying party within 30 days following receipt of any such notice by such indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall have no further liability under such subsection to such indemnified party unless such indemnifying party shall have received other notice addressed and delivered in the manner provided in the second paragraph of Section 13 hereof of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof as provided above, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
 
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party against any of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto), then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omission which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
 
any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
10. Default by An Underwriter.
          (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriters the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated
 
Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters made by the Representatives or the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

     To enable us to render the opinion set forth below, we have examined the Indenture, the form of the Notes, corporate records of the Company, and such other documents and materials as we have considered relevant, and have made such investigation of matters of law and of fact as we have considered appropriate.
     Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that when the Notes are executed by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered against payment therefor, the Notes will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally as in effect from time to time, and except that the availability of certain equitable remedies may be limited by generally applicable equitable principles.

          In addition, in rendering our opinion, we have considered the applicable provisions of (a) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in effect on the date hereof (the "Code"), (b) the applicable Treasury Regulations as in effect on the date hereof (the "Regulations"), (c) current administrative interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") of the Regulations and the Code, (d) existing judicial decisions, (e) such other authorities as we have considered relevant, and (f) our interpretation of the foregoing authorities, all of which such preceding authorities are subject to change or modification at any time (possibly with retroactive effect).
          Based solely upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations stated herein and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the S-3 Registration Statement, we are of the opinion that the discussions set forth in the S-3 Registration Statement under the subheading "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" to the extent that such discussions relate to matters of United States federal income tax law, are accurate in all material respects.
          We express our opinion herein only to those matters specifically set forth above and no opinion should be inferred as to the tax consequences, whether federal, state, local or foreign, of any transactions related to the S-3 Registration Statement, or contemplated by the S-3 Registration Statement. We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the federal income tax law of the United States. No assurance can be given that our opinion will not be challenged by the Service or any other taxing authority, or that any such challenge will not be successful.
          The foregoing opinion reflects our best professional judgment as to the correct U.S. federal tax consequences of the transaction to which this opinion relates. Our opinion is expressly conditioned on, among other things, the accuracy of all such facts, information, statements and representations as of the date hereof. Any material change in the law, authorities, or facts referred to, set forth, relied upon or assumed herein, or in the S-3 Registration Statement could affect the conclusions stated herein. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any changes (including changes that have retroactive effect) (a) in applicable law or (b) that would cause any statement, representation or assumption herein to no longer be true or correct.
          This opinion has been prepared for Monsanto in connection with certain transactions set forth in the S-3 Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 8.1 to the S-3 Registration Statement, and to the references to our firm name therein. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations thereunder.
Sincerely,
/s/ Bryan Cave LLP
