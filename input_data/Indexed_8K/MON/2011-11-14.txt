ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
 
Recast Quarterly Report.
 
 
On April 8, 2011, Monsanto Company (the company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Form 8-K) that revised portions of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the company for the quarter ended Nov. 30, 2010 (the Quarterly Report), which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 7, 2011, to retrospectively reflect subsequent changes in the companys operating segments, which occurred in February 2011.
 
The change in operating segments had no impact on the companys reportable segments or the companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The recast historical financial information in the Form 8-K did not represent an amendment to or restatement of the companys first quarter 2011 consolidated financial statements as previously issued in the Quarterly Report.
 
On November 14, 2011, the company filed an amendment to the Quarterly Report that amended and restated its financial information for the quarter ended November 30, 2010.  Accordingly, the Exhibits filed to the Form 8-K have been superseded.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
