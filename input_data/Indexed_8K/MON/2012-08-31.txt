2013 Annual Incentive Plan
On Aug. 29, 2012, Monsanto Companys People and Compensation Committee (the Committee) approved the Monsanto Company Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan).  The 2013 Plan covers the performance period from Sept. 1, 2012 through Aug. 31, 2013, Monsanto Companys fiscal year 2013.  Eligibility includes regular employees of Monsanto Company and its subsidiaries (the Company) who do not participate in a local sales or business-specific annual incentive plan.  The 2013 Plan excludes from eligibility all Company employees employed in the United States who are members of a collective bargaining unit with whom incentive compensation was the subject of good faith bargaining.
Funding of the 2013 Plan is determined by the Companys attainment of certain financial goals related to net sales (10% weighting), diluted earnings per share (50% weighting) and free cash flow (40% weighting) and the determination by the Committee that such attainment satisfies certain subjective performance criteria as determined by the Committee.  Various performance levels are approved by the Committee with a payout level (as a percentage of target award pool) associated with each level of performance as follows: (i) threshold, 35%, (ii) target, 100%, and (iii) outstanding, 200%.
The award pool will be funded at no less than 20% of target level funding in the event the Company pays dividends with respect to each of its financial quarters ending during the fiscal year 2013.  However, if the Company fails to attain at least the threshold level of performance with respect to the diluted earnings per share goal, the incentive pool may not fund at greater than 20% of the target level of funding.  One or more of the financial goals may be funded at above the outstanding level at the Committees discretion, provided the overall incentive pool would be capped at 200% of target level unless the Committee determines in its discretion to fund above 200%.  Regardless of the attainment of any one or more of the 2013 Plans financial goals, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether the award pool should be funded and the amount of such funding, if any.
The 2013 Plan also contains provisions and exceptions relating to new hires, changes in base compensation, changes in employment status (including termination of employment) and other specific situations.
 
This summary description of the 2013 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2013 Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Terms and Conditions of Option Grants and Restricted Stock Unit Grants
 
On Aug. 29, 2012, the Committee adopted terms and conditions for future option grants and restricted stock unit grants under the Monsanto Company 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of January 24, 2012 (the 2005 LTIP).  No options or restricted stock units were awarded.  The terms and conditions are similar to those previously approved under the 2005 LTIP in effect at the time.
Options are non-qualified options that are not intended to qualify as incentive stock options as

defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The options will generally vest ratably over three years and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.  However, all or a portion of an option may be forfeited in the event the optionee voluntarily terminates employment.  Options will continue to  vest ratably over three years in the event of Retirement, and vesting will be accelerated in the event an optionee experiences involuntary Termination of Service, death, or Disability, or if a Change of Control occurs.
. An award of financial goal restricted stock units (each, a Financial Goal Unit), represents the right to receive one share of Monsanto Company common stock for each Financial Goal Unit upon vesting. The number of Financial Goal Units subject to vesting will be determined by the People and Compensation Committee based on the Companys attainment of specified performance goals relating to equally weighted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and return on capital goals for the defined three-year performance period, and may be up to two times the number of Financial Goal Units initially awarded based on Company performance against the goals.  In order for any Financial Goal Units to vest, the 162(m) Performance Goal must be attained, which goal provides that the Company must have positive Net Income for the defined three-year performance period.  Financial Goal Units will be forfeited if the recipients service with the Company is terminated prior to the end of the three-year performance period, except that vesting of the Financial Goal Units may be prorated or accelerated under certain circumstances in the event of recipients Retirement, death, Disability, or involuntary Termination of Service, or in the event of a termination of employment following a Change of Control prior to expiration of the three-year performance period. Participants may also receive a cash payment upon vesting equal to the value of the cash dividends the participant would have been paid with respect to the number of shares received had the participant owned the shares at all times during the performance period.  Awards of Financial Goal Units are subject to the Companys Recoupment Policy.
Financial Goal Restricted Stock Units
.  The time-based restricted stock units will vest on Nov. 15 of the third year after the date of grant unless the recipients service with the Company terminates prior to such date.  Time-based restricted stock units will be forfeited if the recipients service with the Company is terminated prior to the end of the three-year performance period, except that vesting of the units may be prorated or accelerated under certain circumstances in the event of recipients Retirement, death, Disability, or Termination without Cause on or after the one-year anniversary of the grant date, or if a Change of Control occurs at any time after the grant date.  Time-based restricted stock units will not have dividend equivalent rights.
Time-Based Restricted Stock Units
 
These summary descriptions of the terms and conditions of option grants and terms and conditions of restricted stock unit grants are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of option grants, terms and conditions of financial goal restricted stock units, and terms and conditions of time-based restricted stock unit grants, copies of which are included as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

(b)         The purchase price for the Shares for which the Option is being exercised shall be paid in full at the time of exercise and any other information required by the Committee shall be provided at that time.  The purchase price shall be paid (i) in cash or by check, (ii) by tendering to the Designated Administrator whole Shares (but not fewer than 100 Shares), valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise, or (iii) by any other method designated by the Committee.  The Committee may require payment in a particular or different method in order to comply with applicable law.

7.         .  The Option is not transferable by you other than upon death by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or written designation of a beneficiary.  The Option is exercisable, during your lifetime, only by you (or by your guardian or legal representative).

10.     .  The terms and conditions of this Award Certificate may not be amended in a manner adverse to you without your consent.
Amendment
 
11.       You acknowledge and agree that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time.  The grant of the Option under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of stock options or benefits in lieu of stock options in the future.  Future grants of stock options, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grant, the number of stock options, vesting provisions, and the exercise price.

If there is any ambiguity in this Award Certificate, any term that is not defined in this Award Certificate, or any matters as to which this Award Certificate is silent, the Plan shall govern, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Plan addressing construction, governing law, and the powers of the Committee, among others, to (a) interpret the Plan, (b) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, (c) make appropriate adjustments to the Option to reflect non-United States laws or customs or in the event of a corporate transaction, and (d) make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
Plan Interpretation

Exhibit 10.3
 
You have received an Award of Restricted Stock Units (the Units) under the Monsanto Company 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as Amended and Restated as of January 24, 2012) (the Plan).  The Grant Date and the number of Units initially covered by this Award (the Initial Number of Units) are set forth in the document you have received entitled Long-Term Incentive Statement.  The maximum number of Units that you may receive under this Award (the Maximum Number of Units) is two times the Initial Number of Units.  The Long-Term Incentive Statement and these terms and conditions collectively constitute the Award Certificate for the Units, and describe the provisions applicable to the Units.
 
1.         .  Each capitalized term not otherwise defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Plan or, if not defined in the Plan, in the attached Long-Term Incentive Statement.  The Company means Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation incorporated February 9, 2000.
Definitions
 
2.         .  The Units represent the right to receive, in certain circumstances, a number of Shares determined in accordance with the Long-Term Incentive Statement and these terms and conditions.  Until such time (if any) as Shares are delivered to you, you will not have any of the rights of a common stockholder of the Company with respect to those Shares, your rights with respect to the Units and those Shares will be those of a general creditor of the Company, and you may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, give away, or otherwise dispose of the Units.  Any attempt on your part to dispose of the Units will result in their being forfeited.  However, you shall have the right to receive a cash payment (the Dividend Equivalent Payment) with respect to the Units (if any) that vest pursuant to this Award, subject to withholding pursuant to paragraph 6 below, in an amount equal to the aggregate cash dividends that would have been paid to you if you had been the record owner, on each record date for a cash dividend during the period from the Grant Date through the settlement date of the Units, of a number of Shares equal to the number of Units that vest under this Award.  The Dividend Equivalent Payment shall be made on such settlement date.  You shall not be entitled to receive any payments with respect to any non-cash dividends or other distributions that may be made with respect to the Shares.
Nature of Units
 
3.         .
Vesting of Units
 
(a)         .  Subject to Section 5, in order to vest in the Maximum Number of Units or any lesser number of Units under this Award, the 162(m) Performance Goal must be met (as determined and certified by the Committee following August 31, [20__] [third year after grant]).  The 162(m) Performance Goal is that the Companys Net Income, as defined in the next sentence, must exceed zero for the period from September 1, [20__] [year of grant] through August 31, [20__] [third year after grant].  Net Income means gross profit (i) minus (A) sales, general and
162(m) Performance Goal
 
 
 
 
 
administrative expenses, (B) research and development expense, (C) amortization, (D) net interest expense, and (E) income taxes and (ii) plus or minus other income and expense; all as reported in the Companys financial statements; but excluding positive or negative effects of (I) restructuring charges and reversals, (II) the outcome of lawsuits, (III) impact of liabilities, expenses or settlements related to Solutia, Inc. or agreements associated with a Solutia, Inc. plan of reorganization, (IV) unbudgeted business sales and divestitures, and (V) the cumulative effects of changes in accounting methodology made after August 31, [20__] [year of grant].
 
(b)         .  If the Section 162(m) Performance Goal is met, then the number of Units eligible for vesting under this Award will be determined one-third based upon the Companys achievement of cumulative earnings per share (the EPS Goal), one-third based upon the Companys achievement of cumulative cash flow (the Cash Flow Goal), and one-third based upon the Companys achievement of return on capital (the ROC Goal, and, together with the EPS Goal and the Cash Flow Goal, the Goals and each, singularly, a Goal) for fiscal years [20__], [20__] and [20__] [three years after grant] as compared to the Goals set forth on Exhibit A hereto.  Not later than November 15, [20__] [third year after grant], the Committee will determine the extent to which the Goals have been met, the number of Units that have vested under this Award, and the number of Units to be forfeited, as follows:
EPS, Cash Flow, and ROC Goals
:  For each Goal as to which performance is below threshold level, one-third of the Initial Number of Units shall be forfeited.
Below Threshold-Level Performance
:  For each Goal as to which performance is at or above threshold level but below target level, a number of Units that is equal to (i) one-third of the Initial Number of Units times (ii) the percentage determined by straight-line interpolating between 50% and 100%, based on the relationship between actual performance, threshold-level performance, and target-level performance for the applicable Goal, shall, subject to Section 3(c), vest as of November 15, [20__] [third year after grant].
Above Threshold-Level/Below Target Performance
 
:  For each Goal as to which target-level performance is achieved, one-third of the Initial Number of Units shall, subject to Section 3(c), vest as of November 15, [20__] [third year after grant].
Target-Level Performance
 
:  For each Goal as to which greater than target-level performance is achieved, a number of Units that is equal to (i) one-third of the Initial Number of Units times (ii) the percentage determined by straight-line interpolating between 100% and 200%, based on the relationship between actual performance, target-level performance, and outstanding-level performance for the applicable Goal (for this purpose, performance above the outstanding level for the applicable Goal shall be deemed to be performance at such outstanding level) shall, subject to Section 3(c), vest as of November 15, [20__] [third year after grant].
Above Target-Level Performance
 
(c)         .  If you incur a Termination of Service before November 15, [20__] [third year after grant] as a result of a Job Elimination (other than a Job Elimination subsequent to a Change of Control, which shall be governed by Section 5(d)), your Retirement, or your
Effect of Termination of Service
 
 
 
 
 
Disability or death (each, a Proration Event), then effective as of November 15, [20__] [third year after grant], a number of Units shall vest, equal to (i) the number of Units (if any) that vest based upon the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) above (and, if applicable, taking into account Section 5(c)), times (ii) a fraction (the Proration Fraction), the numerator of which is the number of days from September 1, [20__] [year of grant] through your date of termination, and the denominator of which is 1172 (subject to the special rule of Section 5(c)(v) that applies in the event that a Change of Control occurs following such Termination of Service).  Except as provided in Section 5(d), if you incur a Termination of Service before November 15, [20__] [third year after grant] for any other reason, all Units subject to this Award shall be forfeited as of the date of such Termination of Service.
 
4.         .  The Company shall deliver to you a number of Shares equal to the number of Units (if any) that vest pursuant to this Award (except that in the event of settlement following conversion of this Award into a cash account pursuant to Section 5(a), delivery shall be in cash), subject to withholding as provided in paragraph 6 below.  Such delivery shall take place as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 15 days, after November 15, [20__] [third year after grant].  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Termination of Service that is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that occurs during the two-year period following a Change of Control that qualifies as an event described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, such delivery shall take place as soon as practicable following the date of the applicable Termination of Service.  Nothing in this Agreement, including Section 5, shall preclude the Company from settling upon a Change of Control an Award that is not replaced by a Replacement Award (as defined below), to the extent effectuated in accordance with Treas. Regs.  1.409A-3(j)(ix).
Delivery of Shares
 
5.         .  The provisions of this Section 5 shall govern vesting of this Award upon a Change of Control.
Change of Control
 
(a)         Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Certificate, the number of Units subject to this Award (determined in accordance with Section 5(c)) shall vest in full, except to the extent that another award meeting the requirements of Section 5(b) is provided to you to replace this Award (any award meeting the requirements of Section 5(b), a Replacement Award).  In the event that no Replacement Award is so provided to you, this Award shall be converted into a cash account (based on the number of Units as of the date of the Change of Control (determined in accordance with Section 5(c)) and the value per Share as of the Change of Control), which shall accrue interest at the applicable federal short-term rate provided for in Section 1274(d)(1)(A) of the Code, and be settled in accordance with Section 4 above.  For clarity, such account shall be fully vested as of the Change of Control, in no event shall the amount of such account be increased or decreased as a result of the circumstances of a subsequent Termination of Service, and the provisions of Section 2 relating to Dividend Equivalent Payments shall cease to apply following conversion of this Award into a cash account.
 
(b)         An award shall meet the conditions of this Section 5(b) (and hence qualify as a Replacement Award) if: (i) it is a restricted stock unit in respect of publicly traded equity
 
 
 
 
 
securities of the Company or the surviving corporation following the Change of Control, (ii) it has a value at least equal to the value of this Award as of the date of the Change of Control (determined in accordance with Section 5(c)) and provides for vesting based solely on continued service (with no performance conditions), (iii) it contains terms relating to vesting (including with respect to Termination of Service) that are substantially identical to those of this Award, and (iv) its other terms and conditions are not less favorable to you than the terms and conditions of this Award (including provisions that apply in the event of a subsequent Change of Control) as of the date of the Change of Control. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of this Award if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied.  If a Replacement Award is granted, the Units shall not vest upon the Change of Control.  The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 5(b) are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change of Control, in its sole discretion.
 
(c)         For purposes of this Section 5, the number of Units subject to this Award as of a Change of Control shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:
 
(i)         If the date of the Change of Control is after August 31, [20__] [year of grant] and prior to September 1, [20__] [first year after grant], the number of Units subject to this Award as of such Change of Control shall be the Initial Number of Units.

Exhibit 10.4
You have received an Award of Restricted Stock Units (the RSUs) under the Monsanto Company 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as Amended and Restated as of January 24, 2012) (the Plan).  The Grant Date and the number of RSUs covered by this Award are set forth in the document you received entitled Long-Term Incentive Statement.  The Long-Term Incentive Statement and these terms and conditions collectively constitute the Award Certificate for the RSUs, and describe the provisions applicable to the RSUs.
 
1.
 
.  Each capitalized term not otherwise defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Plan or, if not defined in the Plan, in the attached Long-Term Incentive Statement.  The Company means Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation incorporated February 9, 2000.
Definitions
 
2.
 
.  The RSUs represent the right to receive, in certain circumstances, a number of Shares determined in accordance with the Long-Term Incentive Statement and these terms and conditions.  Until such time (if any) as Shares are delivered to you, you will not have any of the rights of a common stockholder of the Company with respect to those Shares, your rights with respect to the RSUs and those Shares will be those of a general creditor of the Company, and you may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, give away, or otherwise dispose of the RSUs.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall have no voting or dividend equivalent rights with respect to the RSUs.  Any attempt on your part to dispose of the RSUs will result in their being forfeited.
Nature of RSUs
 
3.
 
.  The RSUs shall vest on November 15, [20__] (the Scheduled Vesting Date), except as provided in Sections 4 and 5 below.
Vesting Schedule
 
4.
 
.  If you experience a Termination of Service for any reason, all unvested RSUs subject to this Award shall, except as set forth otherwise in Sections 4 or 5, be forfeited as of the date of such Termination of Service, notwithstanding any differing treatment set forth in the Plan.
Effect of Termination of Service
 
 
(a)         If you experience a voluntary Termination of Service by reason of Retirement before the first anniversary of the Grant Date (unless such Termination of Service follows  a Change of Control), all unvested RSUs shall immediately be forfeited.  If you experience a voluntary Termination of Service by reason of Retirement on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date (or, if earlier, a Change of Control), all outstanding RSUs shall immediately vest, and the Shares shall be delivered in accordance with Section 6.
 
 
1
 
 
(b)         If you experience a Termination of Service as a result of death or Disability prior to the first anniversary of the Grant Date (unless such Termination of Service follows a Change of Control), all unvested RSUs shall immediately be forfeited.  If you experience a Termination of Service as a result of death or Disability on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date (or, if earlier, a Change of Control), all outstanding RSUs shall immediately vest, and the Shares shall be delivered in accordance with Section 6.
 
(c)         If you experience a Termination without Cause prior to the first anniversary of the Grant Date, all unvested RSUs shall immediately be forfeited.  If you experience a Termination without Cause on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, that number of unvested RSUs equal to the number of unvested RSUs multiplied by the Vesting Fraction (determined as set forth below) shall immediately vest, and any remaining unvested RSUs shall immediately be forfeited.  For purposes of this paragraph, if you experience a Termination without Cause on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date (i) either (x) on or after your 55th birthday and your completion of five years of service with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, or (y) due to a job-elimination program or divestiture of the Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Company by which you are employed, the Vesting Fraction shall equal one, or (ii) under any other circumstances, the Vesting Fraction shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the Grant Date through the date of your involuntary Termination of Service, and the denominator of which is the number of days from the Grant Date through the Scheduled Vesting Date, , , that in the event the product of the number of unvested RSUs multiplied by the Vesting Fraction is not a whole number, the number of RSUs that shall vest shall be rounded up to the next whole number. Delivery of Shares shall be made in accordance with Section 6.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, treatment of the RSUs upon a Termination without Cause following a Change of Control shall be governed by Section 5(c).
provided
however
 
(d)         If you experience a Termination for Cause, all unvested RSUs shall immediately be forfeited.
5.
 
.  The provisions of this Section 5 shall govern vesting of this Award upon a Change of Control.
Change in Control
 
(a)         Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, the RSUs shall vest in full, except to the extent that another award meeting the requirements of Section 5(b) is provided to you to replace this Award (any award meeting the requirements of Section 5(b), a Replacement Award).  In the event that no Replacement Award is so provided to you, this Award shall be converted into a cash account (based on the number of RSUs as of the date of the Change of Control and the value per Share as of the Change of Control), which shall accrue interest at the applicable federal short-term rate provided for in Section 1274(d)(1)(A) of the Code, and be settled in accordance with Section 6 below.  For clarity, such account shall be fully vested as of the Change of Control, in no event shall the amount of such account be increased or decreased as a result of the circumstances of a subsequent Termination of Service.
 
 
2
 
 
                   (b)         An award shall meet the conditions of this Section 5(b) (and hence qualify as a Replacement Award) if: (i) it is a restricted stock unit in respect of publicly traded equity securities of the Company or the surviving corporation following the Change of Control, (ii) it has a value at least equal to the value of this Award as of the date of the Change of Control, (iii) it contains terms relating to vesting (including with respect to Termination of Service) that are substantially identical to those of this Award, and (iv) its other terms and conditions are not less favorable to you than the terms and conditions of this Award (including provisions that apply in the event of a subsequent Change of Control) as of the date of the Change of Control. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of this Award if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied.  If a Replacement Award is granted, the RSUs shall not vest upon the Change of Control.  The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 5(b) are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change of Control, in its sole discretion.
 
(c)         Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if you experience (x) a Termination without Cause or (y) a termination under circumstances entitling you to severance benefits under a constructive termination provision (including, without limitation, a good reason provision or a constructive involuntary termination provision) of an agreement, plan or program covering you, in either case, at any time following a Change of Control, the applicable Replacement Award shall vest in full, and the Shares shall be delivered in accordance with Section 6.
 
6.
 
.  The Company shall deliver to you a number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs (if any) that vest pursuant to this Award (except that in the event of settlement following conversion of this Award into a cash account pursuant to Section 5(a), delivery shall be in cash), subject to withholding as provided in paragraph 7 below.  Such delivery shall take place as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 90 days, after the Scheduled Vesting Date.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, with respect to a Termination of Service that is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that occurs during the two-year period following a Change of Control that qualifies as an event described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, such delivery shall take place as soon as practicable following the date of the applicable Termination of Service. Nothing in this Award Certificate, including Section 5, shall preclude the Company from settling upon a Change of Control the Award if it is not replaced by a Replacement Award, to the extent effectuated in accordance with Treas. Regs.  1.409A-3(j)(ix).
Delivery of Shares
 
7.
 
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Certificate, your right to receive Shares in settlement of any RSUs is subject to withholding of all taxes that are required to be paid or withheld in connection with the delivery of those Shares.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, withholding of taxes in connection with the delivery of Shares in settlement of the RSUs shall be satisfied by withholding by the Company of that number of whole Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld.
Withholding

8.
 
.  This Award Certificate shall not limit or restrict the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate your employment or service at any time or for any reason.
No Right to Continued Employment or Service
 
9.
 
.  This Award Certificate shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of any successor of the Company.  The invalidity or enforceability of any provision of this Award Certificate shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Certificate.

Except as otherwise provided herein, this Award Certificate is subject to the provisions of the Plan, and all of the provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated into this Award Certificate as provisions of the RSUs.  If there is a conflict between the provisions of this Award Certificate and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan govern (except as provided otherwise in this Award Certificate).  If there is any ambiguity in this Award Certificate, any term that is not defined in this Award Certificate, or any matters as to which this Award Certificate is silent, the Plan shall govern, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Plan addressing construction and governing law, as well as the powers of the Committee, among others, to (a) interpret the Plan, (b) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, (c) make appropriate adjustments to the RSUs in the event of a corporate transaction, and (d) make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
