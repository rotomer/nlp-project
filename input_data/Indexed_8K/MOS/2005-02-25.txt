Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation.
 
On February 18, 2005, The Mosaic Company ("Mosaic") entered into an $850 million credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (the "Mosaic Credit Facility"). The Mosaic Credit Facility replaces (i) a prior credit facility entered into on October 22, 2004 by Mosaic with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (the "Interim Facility") that consisted of a revolving facility of up to $160 million and (ii) a prior credit facility initially entered into on May 17, 2001 and amended and restated as of February 21, 2003, as amended, by Mosaic Global Holdings Inc. with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (the "Mosaic Global Holdings Credit Facility" and, together with the Interim Facility, the "Prior Credit Facilities") that consisted of a revolving facility of up to $210.0 million and a term loan facility of approximately $249.8 million. Mosaic terminated the Prior Credit Facilities contemporaneously with Mosaic's entry into the Mosaic Credit Facility and all outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facilities were repaid from the proceeds of the Mosaic Credit Facility.
 
The Mosaic Credit Facility is intended to serve as Mosaic's primary senior secured bank credit facility to meet the combined liquidity requirements of all of Mosaic's business segments. The Mosaic Credit Facility includes a $450 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"), a $50 million Term Loan A facility (the "Term Loan A Facility") and a $350 million Term Loan B facility (the "Term Loan B Facility"). The borrowers under the Revolving Facility are Mosaic, Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC and Mosaic Global Holdings Inc.; the borrower under the Term Loan A Facility is Mosaic Potash Colonsay ULC; and the borrower under the Term Loan B Facility is Mosaic Global Holdings Inc. The interest rate currently applicable to borrowings under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan A Facility is Libor plus 1.25 percent while the interest rate applicable to the Term Loan B Facility is Libor plus 1.50 percent.
 
The maturity date of the Revolving Facility is February 18, 2010, the maturity date of the Term Loan A Facility is February 19, 2010 and the maturity date of the Term Loan B Facility is February 21, 2012; provided, however, that an Event of Default would occur unless (a) prior to November 30, 2007, Mosaic Global Holdings' 10.875% Senior Notes due 2008 and Phosphate Acquisition Partners L.P.'s 7% Senior Notes due 2008
(collectively, the "2008 Senior Notes") have either been repurchased, redeemed or refinanced pursuant to an issuance of unsecured debt securities having a maturity date after August 1, 2012 that have terms no less favorable than those of Mosaic Global Holdings' 10.875% Senior Notes due 2013, such that not more than $100,000,000 of the 2008 Senior Notes remains outstanding on November 30, 2007, and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement relating to the Mosaic Credit Facility (the "Credit Agreement"), (b) as of November 30, 2007, the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 2.5 to 1.0, or (c) prior to November 30, 2007, (i) all obligations under the Credit Agreement have been paid in full, and (ii) the lenders have no further commitment to lend, or further exposure under letters of credit issued, under the Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that, prior to November 30, 2007, the 2008 Senior Notes will have been repurchased, redeemed or refinanced, that the Leverage Ratio will be less than 2.5 to 1.0, or that all obligations under the Credit Agreement will have been paid in full and the lenders will have no further commitments to lend or exposure under letters of credit, in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement referred to in the preceding sentence.
 
Prior to maturity, in general, the applicable borrower is obligated to make quarterly amortization payments of principal commencing June 30, 2005 with respect to the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility of $593,750 and $1 million, respectively. In addition, if Mosaic's Leverage Ratio is more than 3.75 to 1.0, borrowings must be prepaid from 50% of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending May 31, 2006.
 
Under the Revolving Facility, Mosaic may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow amounts as revolving loans or swingline loans or obtain letters of credit, up to a maximum of $450 million principal amount outstanding at any time. As of February 18, 2005, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $136.2 million. The net available borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of February 18, 2005 was approximately $313.8 million. As of February 18, 2005, the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility were $50 million and $350 million, respectively.
 
The obligations under the Mosaic Credit Facility are guaranteed by Mosaic, subsidiaries comprising substantially all of Mosaic's domestic operations, Mosaic Canada ULC and Mosaic Potash Colonsay ULC (Mosaic and such subsidiaries being collectively referred to as the "Loan Parties"). The obligations are secured by the security interests in, mortgages on and/or pledges of (i) the equity interests held directly by the Loan Parties in Mosaic's domestic subsidiaries, (ii) 65% of the equity interests in foreign subsidiaries (other than Loan Parties) of Mosaic held directly by Loan Parties, (iii) intercompany borrowings by Mosaic subsidiaries held directly by Loan Parties; (iv) the Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan, potash mine of Mosaic Canada ULC, the Colonsay, Saskatchewan potash mine of Mosaic Potash Colonsay ULC, the Hersey, Michigan, potash mine of Mosaic USA LLC and the Riverview, Florida, phosphates plant of Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC; and (v) all inventory and receivables of the Loan Parties.
The Credit Agreement has cross-default provisions that, in general, provide that a failure to pay principal or interest under other indebtedness in excess of $30 million will result in a cross-default.
 
The Credit Agreement requires Mosaic to maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Mosaic's access to funds is dependent upon its product prices, input costs and market conditions. During periods in which product prices or volumes, raw material prices or availability, or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors, there can be no assurance that Mosaic would be able to comply with applicable financial covenants or meet its liquidity needs. Mosaic cannot assure that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that its currently anticipated growth in net sales and cash flow will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available when needed or in an amount sufficient to enable Mosaic to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Mosaic expects to be in compliance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement throughout fiscal 2005; however, in the event that Mosaic were not to maintain the required financial ratios, there can be no assurance that Mosaic would be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments from the requisite lenders. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the Credit Agreement may result in an event of default. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply the Company with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings).
 
The Credit Agreement also contains other events of default and covenants that limit various matters. Such covenants include limitations on capital expenditures, joint venture investments, monetary acquisitions and indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement generally limits the payment of dividends on Mosaic's common stock and repurchases or redemptions of Mosaic's capital stock beginning February 18, 2005 to $20 million plus an amount equal to the sum of (a) 25% of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending May 31, 2006 and (b) 25% of the net proceeds from equity offerings by Mosaic that comply with the applicable requirements of the Credit Agreement. Additionally, after the payment of any future cash dividends on common stock, the sum of additional borrowings available under the Revolving Facility plus permitted investments must be at least $100 million.

From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) if there is a successor Issuing Bank, the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of an Issuing Bank.
 
(j) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Parent Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Account Parties shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Primary Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such
Cash Collateralization.
provided
 
deposits of cash collateral shall be made in the respective amounts and currencies that correspond to the amounts and currencies of the LC Exposure in respect of each Letter of Credit. Each such deposit pursuant to this paragraph or Section 2.11(b) shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Primary Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Account Parties' risk and expense (unless reasonably objected to by the Parent Borrower in a timely manner), such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Account Parties for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Account Party under this Agreement. If the Account Party is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Account Parties within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Account Party is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Account Party as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Account Party would remain in compliance with Section 2.11(b) and no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
(k) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the other conditions applicable to the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and the approval of the applicable Issuing Bank, LC Applicants may request the issuance of Local Letters of Credit. Upon the issuance of any Local Letter of Credit, and so long as any Local Letter of Credit remains outstanding, the following provisions shall apply:
Local Letters of Credit.
 
(i) For purposes of determining the total LC Exposure at any time and for purposes of calculating fees payable under Section 2.12(b), the amount of any Local Letter of Credit and of any LC Disbursements in respect thereof shall be deemed to be, as of any date of determination, the Dollar Amount thereof at such date. The initial Dollar Amount of any Local Letter of Credit shall be determined by the applicable Issuing Bank on the date of issuance thereof and adjusted from time to time thereafter, in each case, as provided below. The Dollar Amount of each Local Letter of Credit outstanding shall be adjusted by the applicable Issuing Bank on each Calculation Date as provided in Section 2.22(a). If an LC Disbursement is made by the Issuing Bank under any Local Letter of Credit, the Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement shall be determined by such Issuing Bank on the date that such LC Disbursement is made. The applicable Issuing Bank shall make each such determination to be made by it by calculating the amount in Dollars that would be required in order for such Issuing Bank to
 
purchase an amount of the applicable Local Currency equal to the amount of the relevant Local Letter of Credit or unpaid LC Disbursement, as the case may be, on the date of determination at the Spot Exchange Rate with respect to such Local Currency on such date of determination. Each applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower promptly of each such Dollar Amount determined by it, on the date that such determination is required to be made.
 
(ii) Subject to paragraph (iv) below, the obligation of the applicable Account Party to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement under any Local Letter of Credit, and to pay interest thereon, shall be payable only in the Local Currency in which such LC Disbursement is made, and shall not be discharged by paying an amount in Dollars or any other currency; that the applicable Issuing Bank may agree, in its sole discretion, to accept reimbursement in another currency, but any such agreement shall not affect the obligations of the Revolving Lenders or the Account Parties under paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below if such reimbursement is not actually made to the applicable Issuing Bank when due.
provided
 
(iii) The obligation of each Revolving Lender under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section to pay its Applicable Percentage of any unpaid LC Disbursement under any Local Letter of Credit shall be payable only in Dollars and shall be in an amount equal to such Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Amount of such unpaid drawing determined as provided in paragraph (i) above. Under no circumstances shall the provisions hereof permitting the issuance of Letters of Credit in a Local Currency be construed, by implication or otherwise, as imposing any obligation upon any Revolving Lender to make any Loan or other payment under the Loan Documents, or to accept any payment from any Account Party in respect of any unreimbursed LC Disbursement, in any currency other than Dollars, it being understood that the parties intend all payments of Indebtedness created under the Loan Documents (other than the Local Currency Loans as set forth in this Agreement) to be denominated and payable only in Dollars except as expressly provided in paragraph (ii) above and in Section 2.18(a).
 
(iv) If and to the extent that any Revolving Lender pays its Applicable Percentage of any unreimbursed LC Disbursement under any Local Letter of Credit, then, notwithstanding clause (ii) above, the obligation of the applicable Account Party to reimburse the portion of such unreimbursed LC Disbursement funded by such Revolving Lender shall be converted to, and shall be payable only in, Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar amount funded by such Revolving Lender as provided above) and shall not be discharged by paying an amount in any other currency. Interest accrued on such unreimbursed LC Disbursement to and excluding the date of such payment by such Revolving Lender shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank and be payable in the applicable Local Currency, but interest thereafter shall accrue on the Dollar amount owed to such Revolving Lender and shall be payable in Dollars.
 
(l) Each Issuing Bank that is not the same Person as the Person serving as the Administrative Agent shall notify the Administrative Agent of (i) the currency, amount (including the Dollar Amount thereof in the case of Local Letters of Credit) and expiration date of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at or prior to the time of issuance thereof, (ii) any amendment or modification to any such Letter of Credit at or prior to the time of such amendment or modification and (iii) any termination, surrender, cancelation or expiry of any such Letter of Credit at or prior to the time of such termination, surrender, cancelation or expiration.
Certain Notices by Issuing Banks.
 
(m) . LC Applicants may request that an Issuing Bank allow one or more Letters of Credit issued by it to expire later than permitted by clause (ii) of Section 2.05(c). An Issuing Bank may (but shall not have any obligation to) agree to issue such Letters of Credit, provided that no such Letter of Credit shall expire later than the date that is one year after the date of issuance. Any such Letter of Credit is referred to herein as an "". The following provisions shall apply to any Extended Letter of Credit, notwithstanding any contrary provision set forth in this Agreement.
Extended Letters of Credit
Extended Letter of Credit
 
(i) Subject to paragraph (v) below, the participations of each Revolving Lender in each Extended Letter of Credit shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date, with the effect that the Lenders shall not have any obligations to acquire participations in any LC Disbursement made thereafter (other than in respect of demands for drawings submitted prior to such termination).
 
(ii) On or before the fifth Business Day before the Revolving Maturity Date, the relevant Account Parties shall deposit with each Issuing Bank that shall have issued any Extended Letter of Credit then outstanding an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of such date attributable to the outstanding Extended Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such deposits of cash collateral shall be made in the respective amounts and currencies that correspond to the amounts and currencies of the LC Exposure in respect of each Extended Letter of Credit. Each such deposit shall be held by the applicable Issuing Bank as collateral for the obligations of the relevant Account Party in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit. If an Issuing Bank notifies the Administrative Agent that the relevant Account Party has failed to make such deposit of cash collateral with such Issuing Bank when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the amount equal to 105% of the LC Exposure attributable to such Issuing Bank's Extended Letters of Credit, the deposit of cash collateral then due from the relevant Account Party in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in Dollars equal to its Applicable Percentage of the deposit of cash collateral then due from the relevant Account Party, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
mutatis
mutandis
 
relevant Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders, to be held as cash collateral as provided herein; that (A) no Revolving Lender shall be required to make any such payment to the extent that such payment would result in such Lender's Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment and (B) a Revolving Lender shall be relieved of its participation in any Extended Letters of Credit to the extent of any payments made by it under this paragraph to fund deposits of cash collateral securing such Extended Letters of Credit and accordingly its LC Exposure shall be reduced to the extent of such payment and such reduction shall be taken into account in determining the limitation on a Lender's obligation to fund as described in clause (A) of this proviso. Any amounts so received by an Issuing Bank in Dollars that secure any Local Letters of Credit may, in the discretion of such Issuing Bank, be converted by it to the Local Currency in which such Local Letter of Credit is denominated. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to fund deposits of cash collateral shall constitute an ABR Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. Each Account Party hereby consents to the foregoing and agrees that the amounts paid by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to fund deposits of cash collateral required to secure any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Account Party shall constitute ABR Revolving Loans for its account due on the Revolving Maturity Date.
provided
 
(iii) The applicable Issuing Bank shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the collateral account in which it holds amounts deposited with it pursuant to sub-paragraph (ii) above. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the applicable Issuing Bank and at the risk and expense of the Account Parties, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the applicable Issuing Bank to reimburse LC Disbursements in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the obligations of the Account Parties owed to such Issuing Bank hereunder. If any Extended Letter of Credit expires or is terminated, then within three Business Days thereafter the relevant Issuing Bank shall return to the relevant Account Party cash collateral then held attributable to such Extended Letter of Credit (after deducting therefrom any amounts owed to such Issuing Bank by the relevant Account Party that are then due).
 
(iv) Subject to paragraph (v) below, after the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date, the fees that would have accrued pursuant to clause (i) of Section 2.12(b) (if the participations of the Revolving Lenders in the Extended Letters of Credit had not terminated) shall continue to accrue on the LC Exposure in respect of each Extended Letter of Credit and shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank for its own account.
 
(v) If the participations of the Revolving Lenders in the Extended Letters of Credit terminate five Business Days prior to November 30, 2007, because the 2008 Senior Notes Refinancing Condition has not been satisfied or waived, but the 2008 Senior Notes Refinancing Condition is thereafter satisfied or waived prior to termination of the Revolving Commitments, then, upon the effectiveness of such satisfaction or waiver, the participations of each Revolving Lender in each Extended Letter of Credit shall revive and become effective, the fees described in paragraph (iv) above shall commence to accrue for the accounts of the Revolving Lenders (but any such fees accrued for the accounts of the Issuing Banks during the interim period shall remain for their account) and (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the Issuing Banks shall, within three Business Days thereafter, return to the relevant Account Parties any cash collateral held pursuant to paragraph (iii) above.
 
(n) All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement for the account of the Global Borrower (or, in the case of any Existing Letters of Credit issued under the Mosaic Interim Credit Agreement, the Parent Borrower) on and as of the Effective Date and shall constitute Letters of Credit for all purposes of the Loan Documents.
Existing Letters of Credit.
 
SECTION 2.06. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan (other then a Local Currency Loan) to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. Each Lender shall make each Local Currency Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., London time (or the time of such other city designated by the Administrative Agent), to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the applicable Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City (or, in the case of any Local Currency, such other city as the Administrative Agent may designate in respect of the applicable Local Currency) and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
Funding of Borrowings.
provided
provided
 
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower
 
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.07. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable U.S. Borrower, in the case of a Revolving Borrowing, the Canadian Borrower, in the case of a Tranche A Borrowing, or the Global Borrower, in the case of a Tranche B Borrowing, may elect to convert the method of calculating interest in respect of such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as the same Type and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Such Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings or Local Currency Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued; that a Local Currency Loan may be extended by mutual agreement of the relevant Borrower and Lender in respect of such Loan (in which case, at or prior to the effectiveness of such extension, such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent of such extension and of the terms on which such Loan is being extended). Any such election shall not result in a novation and shall not otherwise be considered to result in a repayment and reissue of any Borrowing.
Interest Elections.
provided
 
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request containing the information set forth in Section 2.07(c) and signed by such Borrower.
 
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
 
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
 
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
 
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(e) If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Term Borrowing or Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
SECTION 2.08.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
 
(a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Tranche A Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Effective Date, (ii) the Tranche B Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Effective Date and (iii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.
 
(b) The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans or Local Currency Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the total Revolving Exposures plus the Local Currency Loan Exposure would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.
provided
 
(c) The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments.
provided
 
SECTION 2.09. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender as provided in Section 2.10, (iii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Local Currency Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (iv) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan owed by such Borrower on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
 
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the currency thereof and the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof, the Borrower in respect thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
 
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay its Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima
facie
provided
 
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class (or any Local Currency Loan) made by it to any Borrower be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of a promissory note evidencing one or more Local Currency Loans, such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

(a) Subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section and subject to paragraph (c) of this Section, the Canadian Borrower shall repay Tranche A Term Borrowings (i) on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year prior to the Tranche A Maturity Date, commencing on June 30, 2005, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $593,750, and (ii) on the Tranche A Maturity Date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $38,718,750.

(b) Subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Global Borrower shall repay Tranche B Term Borrowings (i) on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year prior to the Tranche B Maturity Date, commencing on June 30, 2005, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $875,000, and (ii) on the Tranche B Maturity Date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $326,375,000.
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, prior to an Event of Default, (i) the amount of all scheduled repayments of the Tranche A Term Loans required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.10(a) on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date plus (ii) the amount of all mandatory prepayments of the Tranche A Term Loans made or required to be made pursuant to Section 2.11 or any other provision of this Agreement shall not, in the aggregate, at any time on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, exceed an amount equal to 25% of the aggregate principal amount of Tranche A Term Loans made on the Effective Date; that the foregoing shall in no way preclude a Tranche A Lender from receiving principal payments in excess of the foregoing amounts upon or in connection with any Event of Default or voluntary prepayments of Tranche A Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.11.
provided
 
(d) To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Tranche A Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Maturity Date and (ii) all Tranche B Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche B Maturity Date.
 
(e) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing of either Class shall be applied (i) first, to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section during the twelve-month period after the date of such prepayment, in the chronological order thereof, and (ii) after such scheduled repayments during such period have been reduced to zero by reason of such prepayment or any previous prepayments, ratably to the remaining scheduled repayments of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section. If the aggregate principal amount of Tranche A Term Loans made on the Effective Date is less than $50,000,000 or the aggregate principal amount of Tranche B Term Loans made on the Effective Date is less than $350,000,000, the scheduled repayments of Term Borrowings of the applicable Class to be made pursuant to this Section shall be reduced ratably by an aggregate amount equal to such shortfall.
 
(f) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings hereunder, the Canadian Borrower, in the case of Tranche A Borrowings, and Global, in the case of Tranche B Borrowings, shall select the Term Borrowing or Term Borrowings to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.
 
SECTION 2.11. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any of its Borrowings in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section; that a Borrower shall not have the right to prepay any Local Currency Loan without the prior written consent of the Lender thereof (unless the terms of such Local Currency Loan permit such prepayment).
Prepayment of Loans.
provided
 
(b) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the Revolving Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the Borrowers shall prepay Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. In the event that, on any Reset Date, the sum of the total Revolving Exposures and the Local Currency Loan Exposure exceeds 105% of the total Revolving Commitments, then, within three Business Days after notice thereof to the Parent Borrower from the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall prepay the Revolving Loans or Local Currency Loans (or a combination thereof) (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) such that, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the total Revolving Exposures plus the Local Currency Loan Exposure does not exceed the total Revolving Commitments.
 
(c) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment Event, the Borrowers shall, within three Business Days after such Net Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings or Revolving Borrowings (in accordance with paragraph (e) below) in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Proceeds; that,

(f) The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender or, in the case of a Local Currency Loan, the relevant Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment, (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment or (iv) in the case of prepayment of a Local Currency Loan, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment (unless the relevant Lender otherwise agrees). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans or Local Currency Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing (other than a Local Currency Loan) shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender and Local Currency Loan Exposure shall be disregarded for such purpose).

(b) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate as interest on Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure; that a Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive such fee for any period that it is a Defaulting Lender, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and such Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit issued by it or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand.

(c) The Loans comprising each Local Currency Borrowing shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof (i) in the case of a Negotiated Local Currency Loan, at the interest rate agreed upon by the applicable Revolving Lender and the applicable Borrower, (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate Loan, at the applicable Fixed Rate and (iii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Local Currency Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the applicable Margin.
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. For the purposes of the (Canada) and disclosure thereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be paid hereunder or in connection herewith is to be calculated on the basis of 360-day year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in such calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 360. The rates of interest under this Agreement are nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this Agreement.

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
 
Each Lender shall give notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable after determining that the circumstances referred to in paragraph (b) above applicable to such Lender no longer exist, and the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Parent Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable after the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that the circumstances giving rise to any notice given by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence no longer exist.

Increased Costs.

(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank (without duplication of any amounts paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17), as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Parent Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any such certificate shall be accompanied by an explanation of the circumstances or event that resulted in such claim for compensation. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
 
Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the relevant Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Parent Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.15, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital under this Section unless such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, represents to the Parent Borrower that at the time it is the policy or general practice of such Lender or Issuing Bank to demand such compensation for comparable costs or reductions, if any, in similar circumstances, if any, under comparable provisions of other credit agreements for comparable customers.
 
SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment (including any prepayment) of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan or any Local Currency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered by a Borrower pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or any Local Currency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 or 10.02(c), or (e) the conversion of any Local Currency Loan pursuant to Section 9.01(a), then, in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but excluding loss of margin) attributable to such event; that the foregoing shall not be construed to entitle a Lender of a Local Currency Loan to any such compensation (i) if such Lender shall have agreed that it is not entitled to such compensation or (ii) in excess of the compensation payable pursuant to a separate agreement entered into by such Lender with respect to such Loan, if applicable. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the same currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar or eurocurrency (as applicable) market.

Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that a Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any loss, cost or expense incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Parent Borrower of the loss, cost or expense and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.

SECTION 2.17. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section but excluding Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Agents, such Lender or the Issuing Banks, as applicable) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Parent Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the applicable Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Parent Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender has received written notice from the Parent Borrower advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.
 
(f) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (a ""), which in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is allocable to Taxes paid by a Borrower, it shall promptly pay such Tax Refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund) plus any interest paid thereon by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund, net of all taxes and out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender incurred in obtaining such Tax Refund; , , that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender if the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this Section 2.17(f) shall require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information) to the Borrowers or any other Person.

SECTION 2.18. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time or, in the case of an amount payable in a Local Currency, 1:00 p.m. local time at the place of payment), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York (or, in the case of payments in a Local Currency, such other location as provided below), except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
 
payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, except as expressly provided herein with respect to Local Currency Loans and Local Letters of Credit. All payments to be made by any Borrower in a Local Currency pursuant to Section 2.05(k) or in respect of any Local Currency Loan shall be made in such Local Currency in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such Local Currency for the account of the Administrative Agent at such time and at such place as shall have been notified by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Borrower by not less than four Business Days' Notice.
 
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which
provided
 
the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent from such Borrower for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such filing, designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Parent Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such filing, designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(b) If (x) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or (y) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or (z) any Lender defaults in its obligations to fund Loans hereunder, or becomes insolvent and
 
its assets become subject to a receiver, liquidator, trustee, custodian or other Person having similar powers, then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Parent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Parent Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Parent Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

The eligibility of any Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary to borrow or to have Letters of Credit issued for its account hereunder shall terminate when the Administrative Agent receives a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination with respect to such Foreign Subsidiary. Each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Election delivered to the Administrative Agent shall be duly executed on behalf of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary and the Parent Borrower, and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination delivered to the Administrative Agent shall be duly executed on behalf of the Parent Borrower. The delivery of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination shall not affect any obligation of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary theretofore incurred in its capacity as a Borrower, and such Foreign Subsidiary shall continue to constitute a Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary for all purposes hereof (other than the right to borrow Loans or to have Letters of Credit issued for its account) until all its obligations hereunder as a Borrower have been discharged and paid in full. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks of its receipt of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Election or Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination.

SECTION 9.01. (a) On the CAM Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments shall terminate as provided in Article VII, (ii) all Local Currency Loans shall be converted into, and all such amounts due thereunder shall accrue and be payable in, Dollars at the applicable Exchange Rates on such date, and on and after such date the interest rate applicable to all Local Currency Loans shall be the rate applicable to overdue ABR Revolving Loans hereunder and (iii) the Lenders shall automatically and without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section 10.04) be deemed to have exchanged interests in the Credit Facilities such that in lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Credit Facility in which it shall participate as of such date (including such Lender's interest in the Specified Obligations of each Loan Party and each Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary in respect of each such Credit Facility), such Lender shall hold an interest in every one of the Credit Facilities (including the Specified Obligations of each Loan Party and each Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary in respect of each such Credit Facility and each LC Reserve Account established pursuant to Section 9.02 below), whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage thereof. Each Lender and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and any Person that

acquires a participation in its interests in any Credit Facility or Local Currency Loan. Each Borrower agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of new promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Credit Facilities; that the failure of any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
provided
 
(b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Specified Obligations, and each distribution made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to any Security Documents in respect of the Specified Obligations, shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by a Lender upon or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of a Specified Obligation shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance herewith.
 
SECTION 9.02. (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit shall not have been reimbursed by the applicable Borrower or with the proceeds of a Revolving Borrowing, each Revolving Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount in Dollars equal to such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage (as notified to such Lender by the Administrative Agent) of such Letter of Credit's undrawn face amount or (to the extent it has not already done so) such Letter of Credit's unreimbursed drawing (in each case, based on the Dollar Amount thereof determined by the Administrative Agent based upon Spot Exchange Rates prevailing at the time, in the case of any Local Letters of Credit), together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to such amount, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account or accounts for each Lender (each, an "") for the amounts received with respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence. To the extent that any amounts received from the Revolving Lenders as provided above relate to Local Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be converted promptly upon receipt by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Local Currency in an amount equal to the undrawn amount of the relevant Local Letter of Credit and, if the amount in Dollars so received by the Administrative Agent from any Revolving Lender attributable to any Local Letter of Credit is for any reason more or less than the amount necessary to produce the required amount of the relevant Local Currency upon such conversion (based upon the actual cost of conversion determined by the Administrative Agent), then either (i) in the case of a shortfall, such Revolving Lender shall, upon request by the Administrative Agent, pay over to the Administrative Agent, in
Letters of Credit.
LC Reserve Account
 
immediately available funds, an amount in Dollars sufficient to make up the shortfall (as determined by the Administrative Agent and notified to such Revolving Lender) or (ii) in the case of an excess, the Administrative Agent shall refund such excess to such Revolving Lender. The Administrative Agent shall deposit in each Lender's LC Reserve Account such Lender's CAM Percentage of the amounts received from the Revolving Lenders as provided above (including the Local Currencies for which any such amounts have been exchanged as provided in the preceding sentence). The Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control over each LC Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in each LC Reserve Account shall be held in such LC Reserve Account until withdrawn as provided in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) below. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and deposited in the LC Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amounts on deposit in respect of each Letter of Credit attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage. The amounts held in each Lender's LC Reserve Account shall be held as a reserve against the LC Exposure, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against any Loan Party or Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary and shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of any Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05.
 
(b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the applicable Issuing Bank, withdraw from the LC Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to the amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing, deposited in respect of such Letter of Credit and remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts to such Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Revolving Lenders under Section 2.05(e) (but not of the applicable Borrower under Section 2.05(e)). In the event any Revolving Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount to the Administrative Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 9.02, the applicable Issuing Bank shall, in the event of a drawing thereunder, have a claim against such Revolving Lender to the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section 2.05(e), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 9.01. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting Revolving Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the event such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the defaulted amount.
 
(c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the LC Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in respect of such Letter of Credit and distribute such amount to such Lender. If any amount to be distributed to a Lender pursuant to this paragraph is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the Admnistrative Agent will, if so requested by such Lender, convert the amount to be distributed to such Lender into Dollars (in accordance with the Administrative Agent's customary foreign exchange procedures) and distribute the resulting amount in Dollars to such Lender; that the Administrative Agent shall not have any liability to such Lender for any loss experienced in connection with such exchange.
provided
 
(d) With the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank with an outstanding Letter of Credit, any Lender may withdraw the amount held in its LC Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit, to pay over to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank on demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing; that, in the case of a drawing under a Local Letter of Credit, the amount to be paid over to the Administrative Agent shall be paid in the relevant Local Currency or, if in Dollars, in an amount determined by the Administrative Agent to be sufficient to permit the Administrative Agent to exchange such amount for such Lender's CAM Percentage of the relevant Local Currency amount.
provided
 
(e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its LC Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its amounts in its LC Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (d) above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the Administrative Agent with amounts in its LC Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account.

SECTION 10.02. (a) No failure or delay by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments.
 
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.23 with respect to an Incremental Facility Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified (unless otherwise specified herein, therein or in such provision) except, in the case of this Agreement,

any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of such Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders (but not the Tranche A Lenders, Tranche B Lenders and Incremental Term Lenders) or the Tranche A Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders, Tranche B Lenders and Incremental Term Lenders) or the Tranche B Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders, Tranche A Lenders and Incremental Term Lenders) or the Incremental Term Lenders (but not the Tranche A Lenders, Tranche B Lenders and the Revolving Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Primary Borrowers and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrowers, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender) if (i) by the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.
 
(c) In connection with any proposed waiver, amendment or modification (a "") requiring the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender, if the consent of the Supermajority Lenders (and, to the extent any Proposed Change requires the consent of Lenders holding Loans of any Class pursuant to clause (viii) of Section 10.02(b), the consent of not less than 66-2/3% in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of such Class) to such Proposed Change is obtained, but the consent to such Proposed Change of other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this Section 10.02(c) being referred to as a ""), then, so long as the Lender that is acting as the Administrative Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, at the Parent Borrower's request, any assignee that is acceptable to the Administrative Agent shall have the right, with the Administrative Agent's consent, to purchase from such Non-Consenting Lender, and such Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Parent Borrower's request, sell and assign to such assignee, at no expense to such Non-Consenting Lender, all the Commitments, Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Exposure of such Non-Consenting Lender for an amount equal to the principal balance of all Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans (and funded participations in Swingline Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements) held by such Non-Consenting Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale (including amounts under Section 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17), such purchase and sale to be consummated pursuant to an executed Assignment and Assumption in accordance with Section 10.04(b) (which Assignment and Assumption need not be signed by such Non-Consenting Lender).
