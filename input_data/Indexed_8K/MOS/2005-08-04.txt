Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 29, 2005, The Mosaic Company ("Mosaic") entered into an amendment to its $850 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (the "Mosaic Credit Facility"). The principal purpose of the amendment was to make technical changes to the Mosaic Credit Facility in order to permit the merger (the "Merger") into a single legal entity of three separate legal entities through which Mosaic was conducting its Phosphates business segment. These three separate legal entities were acquired by Mosaic on October 22, 2004 as part of the combination (the "Combination") of the businesses of IMC Global Inc. and the fertilizer businesses of Cargill, Incorporated in the transaction that resulted in the formation of Mosaic. The Merger, which was also effectuated on July 29, 2005, is an important step towards simplifying Mosaic's internal structure in a manner that facilitates achieving synergies from the Combination.
 
The amendment also made several additional changes to the Mosaic Credit Facility, including among other things (i) reducing restrictions under the Mosaic Credit Facility on repurchases of indebtedness junior to the indebtedness under the Mosaic Credit Facility in order to facilitate Mosaic's use of available cash to reduce junior indebtedness, (ii) expanding the range of financing and refinancing alternatives for revolving credit facilities and foreign subsidiary indebtedness that were permitted under the Mosaic Credit Facility, and (iii) relaxing certain restrictions in order to facilitate Mosaic's ability to obtain surety bonds.

SECTION 6.16.

However, Phosphates is such a "Restricted Subsidiary". As a result, Events of Default under Article VII (c) and (d) have occurred.

Waiver and Consent.
 
(b) Under Section 6.07 of the Credit Agreement, the Parent Borrower agreed, for itself and its Subsidiaries, not to enter into any Swap Agreement except for certain categories of Swap Agreements. However, one of the Parent Borrower's Subsidiaries entered into a Swap Agreement, which is no longer in effect, which was not permitted under Section 6.07. As a result an Event of Default under Article VII(d) has occurred. Upon the Amendment Effective Date, the Required Lenders waive the Event of Default described in the preceding sentence.
 
(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event that a Subsidiary that is a Global Loan Party ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Global Borrower but becomes (or, as a result of a merger or consolidation involving such Subsidiary, the survivor is) a Mosaic Loan Party (including pursuant to the Phosphates Reorganization), then such Mosaic Loan Party should be released as a party to the Global Security Documents (as defined in the Global Collateral Sharing Agreement), that such Mosaic Loan Party becomes (or, if applicable, remains) a party to the Mosaic Pledge Agreement and the Mosaic Security Agreement (and, if it is a party to a Global Mortgage (as defined in the Global Collateral Sharing Agreement) at the time it ceased to be a Global Loan Party, then such Mortgage should be amended to eliminate collateral sharing provisions). Effective upon the Amendment Effective Date, the Required Lenders consent to any amendments to the Global Security Documents that the Collateral Agent approves as necessary or appropriate to give effect to the foregoing.
provided
 
SECTION 3. Each of the U.S. Borrowers represents and warrants to each of the Lenders that, after giving effect to the amendments and waivers contemplated hereby, (a) the representations and warranties of the Borrowers set forth in the Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Amendment Effective Date, (b) no Default has occurred and is continuing, (c) the Phosphates Reorganization shall have been consummated or is being consummated on the Amendment Effective Date and (d) the Phosphates Reorganization will not (i) violate the charter, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority or (ii) violate or result in a default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Parent Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or their assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Parent Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries.
Representations and Warranties.
 
SECTION 4. This Amendment shall become effective as of the date (the "") when the Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received (a) copies hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of the Borrowers and the Required Lenders, (b) evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the Phosphates Reorganization has been consummated or is being consummated on the Amendment Effective Date, (c) amendments to the Security Documents signed by the necessary Loan Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the Phosphates Reorganization with the result that the Fertilizer Borrower will be a Mosaic Loan Party and not a Global Loan Party, and (d) to the extent invoiced, payment of all out-of-pocket expenses required to be paid or reimbursed by any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
