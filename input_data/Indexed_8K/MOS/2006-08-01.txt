Exhibit 99.1 3033 Campus Drive Tel 800-918-8270 Suite E490 Fax 763-577-2986 Plymouth, MN 55441 www.mosaicco.com Press Release MEDIA CONTACT: Linda Thrasher, 763-577-2864 INVESTOR CONTACT: Douglas Hoadley, 763-577-2867 MOSAIC REPORTS FISCAL 2006 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS o The fourth quarter net loss for the period ended May 31, 2006, was $180.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share ("per share"). This compares to reported net earnings of $94.1 million or $0.22 per share for last year's fourth quarter. Included in the results are: o A charge of $287.6 million pre-tax and $285.6 million after tax, or $0.75 per share, from the previously announced restructuring of the Phosphates business. o A tax benefit of $81.0 million, or $0.21 per share, related to the reduction in Canadian deferred tax liabilities as a result of statutory changes in future tax rates in the Province of Saskatchewan during the fourth quarter. o Pre-tax foreign currency transaction losses of $34.1 million, or $0.05 per share, during the fourth quarter compared with a gain of $8.0 million in the prior year period. o Net sales declined 8%, mainly due to lower volumes for phosphates and potash. Mosaic's gross margin declined to 12.5% of net sales compared to 16.9% a year ago. Margins declined as a result of lower production levels and lower high-margin potash sales during the quarter. o The Phosphates business had an operating loss of $268.8 million in the fourth quarter, including the restructuring charge, compared with operating earnings of $68.8 million for the same period a year ago. o The Potash business had operating earnings of $83.8 million in the fourth quarter compared with $118.9 million a year ago as net sales declined 23% due to lower volumes. o The Phosphates business is expected to show improved results in fiscal 2007 due to the completion of the previously announced restructuring activities. The Potash business is also expected to improve during the second half of calendar 2006 with Canpotex shipments resuming to China. PLYMOUTH, MN, August 1, 2006 - The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) announced today a net loss of $180.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the quarter ended May 31, 2006. Mosaic's fiscal 2006 net loss was $121.4 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to fiscal 2005 net earnings of $165.6 million or $0.46 per share. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.33 billion, a decline of 8% compared with the same period a year ago. The decline in net sales was mainly the result of lower sales volumes for the Potash and Phosphates business segments.
"Fiscal 2006 was a transition year for Mosaic and we look forward with confidence to 2007 and beyond. We took aggressive strategic action to restructure our Phosphates business at the end of the fiscal year to make us more cost competitive in the global marketplace," said Fritz Corrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mosaic. "In the Potash business, while markets have been weak, we expect volumes to improve during the second half of calendar 2006 now that a supply contract has been entered into between Canpotex and Sinofert in China." Mosaic's gross margin for the fourth quarter was $166.2 million compared with $245.6 million for the same period a year ago. This included unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative contracts of $11.2 million compared with a loss of $4.3 million a year ago. The gross margin as a percent of sales was 12.5% for the fourth quarter compared with 16.9% a year ago. Although selling prices were higher for most products, they were more than offset by an unfavorable sales mix due to lower Potash sales volumes and the effect of reduced potash and phosphates production levels. In addition, operating costs were higher resulting from increases in energy-based raw materials and other input prices. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $54.6 million were incurred in the fourth quarter, compared to $65.8 million for the same period a year ago. This decline was mainly because of a one-time $14 million Brazilian value-added tax (VAT) credit. SG&A costs were adversely affected by first year Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance activities. Non-cash foreign currency transaction losses totaled $34.1 million for the fourth quarter compared with a gain of $8.0 million for the same period a year ago. This was mainly the result of the effect of a strong Canadian dollar on large U.S. dollar-denominated intercompany receivables held by Mosaic's Canadian affiliates. For the fourth quarter, Mosaic's tax benefit was $61.2 million on a pre-tax loss of $261.5 million. Mosaic continues to have a high effective underlying tax rate as a result of losses in the United States and Brazil, and because its Canadian-based businesses are taxed at relatively higher rates than the other businesses of the company. Included in the fourth quarter was an $81.0 million tax benefit from the reduction in Canadian deferred tax liabilities as a result of the statutory reduction in future tax rates in the Province of Saskatchewan. Mosaic ended the quarter with $173.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Mosaic's total debt at the end of May 2006 was $2.6 billion, resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 42.6%. POTASH The Potash business segment's total sales volume was 1.7 million tonnes during the fourth quarter which was 31% lower than last year's fourth quarter volumes. This was due to a slow North American market as well as a weak export market, especially in China and India. The average potash selling price increased to $141 per tonne, up $6 per tonne from the same period a year ago. Potash net sales were $328.3 million for the fourth quarter, down 23% compared with a year ago. The Potash business segment's gross margins declined to $100.1 million in the fourth quarter or 30.5% of sales, compared with $125.7 million a year ago or 29.7% of sales. This included an unrealized non-cash gain of $15.2 million resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts for the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $0.8 million a year ago. Operating earnings were $83.8 million during the fourth quarter compared to $118.9 million for the same period last year. 2
PHOSPHATES The Phosphates business segment's fertilizer and feed shipments were 2.8 million tonnes for the fourth quarter, down 0.6 million tonnes compared with year ago levels. The average fourth quarter diammonium phosphate (DAP) price increased by 14% compared with last year to $248 per tonne. Phosphates net sales were $805.8 million for the fourth quarter, 1% lower than the fourth quarter last year. Phosphates' fourth quarter gross margin was $39.9 million or 5.0% of net sales, compared with $96.5 million or 11.9% of net sales for the same period a year ago. Operating losses were $268.8 million, including the Phosphates restructuring charge of $287.6 million, compared with operating earnings of $68.8 million for the same period a year ago. The cost of producing DAP increased 10% in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year period mainly because of higher energy-based ammonia and sulfur prices. Operating costs were also higher on a per tonne basis as Mosaic operated its mining and production facilities at lower rates during this period. OFFSHORE Mosaic's Offshore business segment's net sales were $236.8 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 8% compared with last year. Offshore's fourth quarter operating earnings were $10.5 million compared to a loss of $5.8 million for the comparable period last year. The increase in fourth quarter operating earnings was the result of a Brazilian VAT credit. Offshore results continued to be negatively affected by poor farm economics in Brazil. NITROGEN Mosaic's Nitrogen business segment's fourth quarter operating earnings were $4.7 million compared to $3.5 million for the fourth quarter a year ago. EQUITY EARNINGS Total equity earnings in non-consolidated subsidiaries were $19.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $8.1 million compared with last year's results for the same period. Mosaic's equity earnings from its investment in Saskferco were $10.7 million for the fourth quarter compared with $6.8 million a year ago. Mosaic's equity earnings from Fosfertil were $3.3 million for the fourth quarter compared to $4.7 million last year. FISCAL 2006 Net sales increased 21% to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2006 mainly as a result of the business combination that formed Mosaic in October 2004 along with higher prices for phosphates and potash products. Gross margin also increased $111.9 million to $637.4 million, which was 12% of net sales. Higher prices were offset by increased costs of production. Operating earnings were $105.8 million in fiscal 2006, including the $287.6 million Phosphates restructuring charge, compared with $318.5 million in fiscal 2005. There was a foreign currency transaction loss of $100.6 million in fiscal 2006, or $0.15 per share, compared with a gain of $13.9 million a year ago, primarily as a result of a strong Canadian dollar and large U.S. dollar-denominated inter-company receivables held by Mosaic's Canadian affiliates. The equity in net earnings of non-consolidated companies was $48.4 million, a decline of $7.5 million compared with the prior year due to weaker results from Fosfertil. Dividends from non-consolidated companies totaled $26.7 million in fiscal 2006. 3
As of the end of fiscal 2006, Mosaic had surpassed its synergy benefits goal from the business combination between IMC Global and Cargill's Crop Nutrition businesses of $145 million calculated on an annual run-rate basis. Synergy benefits include cost reduction and cost avoidance initiatives, production volume enhancement efforts, opportunity savings, capital spending avoidance and other classifications. In fiscal 2006, the benefits of the synergies have been significantly offset by higher costs for energy and other production inputs, wages and benefits, water treatment, raw material inputs, general inflation and one-time costs to achieve them. OBSERVATIONS AND OUTLOOK "We are encouraged by more attractive industry fundamentals in our Phosphates and Potash businesses as well as the expected benefits of our Phosphates restructuring, which should result in lower costs of production and higher margins in fiscal 2007," Corrigan said. "We expect Potash volumes to recover during the second half of calendar 2006 now that contracts have been signed between Canpotex and Sinofert, a key Chinese customer. We believe that inventory levels throughout the potash distribution pipeline, including China and India, have been sharply reduced." For Phosphates, fiscal 2007 sales volumes are expected to range from 9.5 to 9.9 million tonnes, including 0.9 millions tonnes of feed phosphates. Phosphates margins are expected to benefit from cost declines due to expectations of lower raw material prices. Potash sales volumes for fiscal 2007 are anticipated to be between 7.7 and 8.1 million tonnes taking into account resumed shipments by Canpotex to China in August 2006. In July, Mosaic's single super phosphate (SSP) plant in Quebracho, Argentina began production and is expected to produce up to 240,000 tonnes of granular SSP annually. Mosaic anticipates capital spending ranging between $250 million and $290 million during fiscal 2007 compared with $389.5 million in fiscal 2006. This reduced level of capital spending is primarily a result of the Phosphates restructuring. Mosaic expects to record a tax benefit of $45 to $50 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of a reduction in future Canadian Federal tax rates, which leads to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities. This is similar in nature to the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter from a reduction in the Saskatchewan Provincial tax rate. As they are implemented, these tax rate changes will result in a lower effective tax rate for Mosaic.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY (unaudited) - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations The following table summarizes the calculation of EBITDA and provides a reconciliation to net earnings (loss): EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Calculation - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Interest expense is exclusive of amortization of debt financing fees and amortization of fair market value adjustment of debt. The Company has presented above EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a supplemental numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Moreover, EBITDA as presented in this press release is different than similarly titled measures used for purposes of financial covenants in our senior secured bank credit facility and other covenants relating to our indebtedness, all of which require different adjustments, both positive and negative, that were the result of negotiations with the lenders. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, which we present above, excludes restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring of our Phosphates business. The Restructuring and other charges are not items that are generally excluded from EBITDA. In evaluating these measures, investors should consider that our methodology in calculating such measures may differ from that used by other companies. 8
EBITDA, or various adjusted measures of EBITDA, is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, lenders and others to evaluate companies' performance, including, among other things, cash flows and profitability before the effect of financing and similar decisions. Because securities analysts, investors, lenders and others use EBITDA, Mosaic's management believes that our presentation of EBITDA affords them greater transparency in assessing our financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because, when presented with EBITDA, it highlights the extent to which EBITDA in fiscal 2006 and our fourth fiscal quarter was affected by our decision to restructure our Phosphates business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
