Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
(a) On December 1, 2006, The Mosaic Company ("Mosaic") completed a refinancing (the "Refinancing") pursuant to which:
 
 
 
Offers to purchase Existing Notes
The Existing Notes purchased by subsidiaries of Mosaic pursuant to tender offers consisted of $124,038,000 aggregate principal amount of Mosaic Global Holdings' 6.875% Debentures due 2007, $370,979,676 aggregate principal amount of its 10.875% Senior Notes due 2008, $374,065,000 aggregate principal amount of its 11.250% Senior Notes due 2011, and $396,090,000 aggregate principal amount of its 10.875% Senior Notes due 2013, and $145,819,000 aggregate principal amount of Phosphate Acquisition Partners L.P.'s 7% Senior Notes due 2008. After giving effect to these purchases, $25,962,000 aggregate principal amount of Mosaic Global Holdings' 6.875% Debentures due 2007, $23,908,324 aggregate principal amount of its 10.875% Senior Notes due 2008, $29,395,000 aggregate principal amount of its 11.250% Senior Notes due 2011, and $3,525,000 aggregate principal amount of its 10.875% Senior Notes due 2013 and $4,181,000 aggregate principal amount of Phosphate Acquisition Partners L.P.'s 7% Senior Notes due 2008 remain outstanding.
New Senior Notes
The indentures relating to the New Senior Notes contain certain covenants and events of default that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Except for the covenants limiting the Company's ability to use assets as security in other transactions, merge with or into other companies and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and a covenant requiring that subsidiaries that guarantee specified types of other obligations of the Company also guarantee the New Senior Notes, the covenants relating to the types of matters listed above will no longer apply in the event that the New Senior Notes receive an investment grade rating from at least two of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), Moody's Investor's Services Inc. ("Moody's") and Fitch Inc. ("Fitch") and certain other conditions are satisfied (the "Fall-Away Event").
Under the covenant limiting the payment of dividends, as of August 31, 2006, after giving effect to the Refinancing, Mosaic had at least $60 million available for the payment of cash dividends with respect to its common stock.
The indenture relating to the New Senior Notes also contains provisions requiring Mosaic to offer to purchase, at 101% of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest), all of the outstanding New Senior Notes upon a change of control of Mosaic followed within 90 days by a decline in the rating assigned to the New Senior Notes by S&P, Moody's or Fitch.
The indenture relating to the New Senior Notes also contains other covenants and events of default that limit various matters or require the Company to take various actions under specified circumstances.
The obligations under the New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Mosaic's domestic subsidiaries that are involved in operating activities, Mosaic's subsidiaries that own and operate the Company's potash mines at Belle Plaine and Colonsay, Saskatchewan, Canada, and intermediate holding companies through which Mosaic owns the guarantors. Subsidiaries that are not guarantors generally are other foreign subsidiaries, insignificant domestic subsidiaries and other domestic subsidiaries that are not directly engaged in operating activities.
Mosaic may, in general and at prices and subject to conditions specified in the indenture relating to the New Senior Notes, redeem:
 
The offering of the New Senior Notes was made only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The New Senior Notes were not registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Mosaic has entered into registration rights agreements with the
initial purchasers of the New Senior Notes pursuant to which Mosaic agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and cause to become effective a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange the New Senior Notes for an issue of notes registered under the Securities Act, with terms identical to those of the New Senior Notes, and, following the effective date of such registration statement, to offer to exchange the New Senior Notes for such registered notes. If interpretations of the staff of the SEC do not permit Mosaic to effect the exchange offers, Mosaic has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration with respect to each series of the New Senior Notes. If such an exchange offer is not completed (or, if required, the shelf registration statement is not declared effective) on or before December 1, 2007 with respect to either series of the New Senior Notes, the annual interest rate on such series of New Senior Notes will increase by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following such date and by an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period, up to an additional rate of 1.00% per annum, until the exchange offer is completed (or, if required, the shelf registration statement is declared effective).
Amended and restated credit facilities
The amended and restated credit facilities are intended to serve as the Company's primary senior secured bank credit facilities to meet the combined liquidity needs of all of the Company's business segments. After the Refinancing, the credit facilities under the Restated Credit Agreement consist of a revolving credit facility of up to $450.0 million available for revolving credit loans, swingline loans and letters of credit, a term loan A facility of $46.4 million, a term loan A-1 facility of $400.0 million and a term loan B facility of $612.0 million. As of November 30, 2006, as adjusted for the Refinancing, under the revolving credit facility:
 
 
 
The borrowers under the revolving credit facility are Mosaic and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC and Mosaic Global Holdings Inc.; the borrower under the term loan A facility is Mosaic Potash Colonsay ULC; and the borrower under the term loan A-1 facility and the term loan B facility is Mosaic.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the term loan A facility and the term loan A-1 facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, and borrowings under the term loan B facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. Commitment fees accrue at a rate of 0.375% on unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.
The Restated Credit Agreement requires Mosaic to maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These ratios become more stringent over time pursuant to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that Mosaic will be able to meet these ratios in the future, particularly as they become more stringent. Mosaic's access to funds is dependent upon its product prices, input costs and market conditions. During periods in which product prices or volumes, raw material prices or availability, or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors, there can be no assurance that Mosaic would be able to comply with applicable financial covenants or meet its liquidity needs. Mosaic cannot assure that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that its currently anticipated net sales and cash flow will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available when needed or in an amount sufficient to enable Mosaic to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.
The Restated Credit Agreement also contains events of default and covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to:
 
 
 
In addition, a change of control of Mosaic is a default under the Restated Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to the limitation on the payment of dividends, the payment of dividends on Mosaic's common stock and repurchases or redemptions of Mosaic's capital stock beginning February 18, 2005 is generally limited to $20 million plus an amount equal to the sum of (a) 25% of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 and (b) 25% of the net proceeds from equity offerings by Mosaic that comply with the applicable requirements of the Restated Credit Agreement. Additionally, after the payment of any cash dividends on common stock, the sum of additional borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility plus permitted investments must be at least $100.0 million. Under the covenant limiting the payment of dividends, as of August 31, 2006, Mosaic had $35.1 million available for the payment of cash dividends with respect to its common stock under this covenant.
In connection with the Refinancing, certain covenants in Mosaic's existing credit agreement were amended to provide Mosaic with greater financial flexibility. These amendments included adjustments to the required levels of the leverage ratio and the interest coverage ratio effective beginning with Mosaic's fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2006.
The Restated Credit Agreement also contains other covenants and events of default that limit various matters or require the Company to take various actions under specified circumstances.
The obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of Mosaic's domestic subsidiaries that are involved in operating activities, Mosaic's subsidiaries that own and operate the Company's potash mines at Belle Plaine and Colonsay, Saskatchewan, Canada, and intermediate holding companies through which Mosaic owns the guarantors. Subsidiaries that are not guarantors generally are other foreign subsidiaries, insignificant domestic subsidiaries and other domestic subsidiaries that are not directly engaged in operating activities. The obligations are secured by security interests in mortgages on and/or pledges of (i) the equity interests in the guarantors and in domestic subsidiaries held directly by Mosaic and the guarantors under the Restated Credit Agreement; (ii) 65% of the equity interests in other foreign subsidiaries held directly by Mosaic and such guarantors; (iii) intercompany borrowings by subsidiaries that are held by Mosaic and such guarantors; (iv) the Belle Plaine and Colonsay, Saskatchewan, Canada and Hersey, Michigan potash mines and the Riverview, Florida phosphate plant owned by the Company; and (v) all inventory and receivables of Mosaic and such guarantors.
The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is February 18, 2010, the maturity date of the term loan A facility is February 19, 2010, the maturity date of the term loan A-1 facility is December 1, 2011 and the maturity date of the term loan B facility is December 1, 2013.
Prior to maturity, in general, the applicable borrower is obligated to make quarterly amortization payments of $593,750 with respect to the term loan A facility, $4,750,000 commencing March 31, 2007 with respect to the term loan A-1 facility, and $1,530,000 commencing March 31, 2007 with respect to the term loan B facility. In addition, if Mosaic's leverage ratio under the Restated Credit Agreement is more than 3.75 to 1.00, borrowings must be repaid from 50% of excess cash flow for each fiscal year.
 
Most of the material debt instruments of the Company, including the Restated Credit Agreement and the indenture relating to the New Senior Notes, have cross-default provisions. In general, pursuant to these provisions, a failure to pay principal or interest under other indebtedness in excess of a specified threshold amount will result in a cross-default. The threshold under the Restated Credit Agreement and the indenture relating to the New Senior Notes is $30.0 million. Of the Company's material debt instruments, the indentures relating to Mosaic Global Holdings' 7.375% debentures due 2018 and 7.300% debentures due 2028 have the lowest specified cross-default threshold amount, $25.0 million.
The descriptions set forth above of the New Senior Notes, the indenture relating thereto, the registration rights agreements and the Restated Credit Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, the registration rights agreements and the Restated Credit Agreement filed herewith as exhibits.

However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective with respect to a series of Securities, it shall bind every Securityholder of such series. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the execution of such amendment or waiver by the Trustee.
Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers.
 
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Securityholders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
SECTION 9.05. If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security of any series shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security of such series that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
SECTION 9.06. The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it.

Payment for Consent.
SECTION 10.01. Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder of such series and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities of such series when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and

Guaranteed Obligations
Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations with respect to such series and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities waives notice of any default under the Securities of such series or the Guaranteed Obligations of such series. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder of a series of Securities shall not be affected by (1) the failure of any Holder of such series or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person (including any Subsidiary Guarantor of such series) under this Indenture with respect to such series, the Securities of such series or any other agreement or otherwise; (2) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (3) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture with respect to such series, the Securities of such series or any other agreement; (4) the release of any security held by any Holder of such series or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations of such series or any of them; (5) the failure of any Holder of such series or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations of such series; or (6) except as set forth in Section 10.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to such series herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder of such series or the Trustee for such series to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations of such series.
Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 10.02 and 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of such series or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder of such series or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture with respect to such series, the Securities of such series or any other agreement, by any waiver or
 
modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to such Series herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation with respect to such series is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder of such series or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder of a series of Securities or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor of such series by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Obligation with respect to such series when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Obligation with respect to such series, each Subsidiary Guarantor of such series hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders of such series or the Trustee for such series an amount equal to the sum of (A) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (B) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (C) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders of such series and the Trustee for such series.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of such series and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations with respect to such series hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to such series herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations with respect to such series guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 10.01.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee for such series or any Holder of such series in enforcing any rights under this Section 10.01.
SECTION 10.02. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to a series of Securities shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby
Limitation on Liability.
 
guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
SECTION 10.03. This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
Successors and Assigns.
SECTION 10.04. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver.
SECTION 10.05. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification.
SECTION 10.06. A Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its obligations under this Article 10 (other than any obligation that may have arisen under Section 10.07) upon:

provided
(2) at such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor does not have any Indebtedness or guarantee outstanding (after giving effect to any retirement of Indebtedness or release of a guarantee that occurs concurrently with such release of a guarantee of the Securities) that would have required such Subsidiary Guarantor to enter into a supplemental indenture guaranteeing the Securities' obligations in respect of the Securities pursuant to Section 4.12;
 
(3) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture;

14.
Defaults and Remedies
Under the Indenture, Events of Default with respect to the 2014 Securities include (a) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the 2014 Securities; (b) default in payment of principal on the 2014 Securities at maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of the 2014 Securities, upon acceleration or otherwise; (c) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture with respect to the 2014 Securities or the 2014 Securities, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (d) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $30 million; (e) certain events of bankruptcy or
 
insolvency with respect to the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries; (f) certain judgments or decrees for the payment of money in excess of $30 million; and (g) certain defaults with respect to Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2014 Securities. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 2014 Securities may declare all the 2014 Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the 2014 Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
Holders of the 2014 Securities may not enforce the Indenture with respect to the 2014 Securities or the 2014 Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture with respect to the 2014 Securities or the 2014 Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2014 Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the 2014 Securities notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders.
15.
Trustee Dealings with the Company
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of 2014 Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
16.
No Recourse Against Others
No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, agent or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the 2014 Securities, the Indenture with respect to the 2014 Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, agent or stockholder of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the 2014 Securities, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the 2014 Securities, the Indenture with respect to the 2014 Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of 2014 Securities and Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2014 Securities by accepting a 2014 Security and a Subsidiary Guarantee of the 2014 Securities waives and releases all such liabilities. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the 2014 Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2014 Securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

14.
Defaults and Remedies
Under the Indenture, Events of Default with respect to the 2016 Securities include (a) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the 2016 Securities; (b) default in payment of principal on the 2016 Securities at maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of the 2016 Securities, upon acceleration or otherwise; (c) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture with respect to the 2016 Securities or the 2016 Securities, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (d) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $30 million; (e) certain events of bankruptcy or
 
insolvency with respect to the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries; (f) certain judgments or decrees for the payment of money in excess of $30 million; and (g) certain defaults with respect to Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2016 Securities. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 2016 Securities may declare all the 2016 Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the 2016 Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
Holders of the 2016 Securities may not enforce the Indenture with respect to the 2016 Securities or the 2016 Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture with respect to the 2016 Securities or the 2016 Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2016 Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the 2016 Securities notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders.
15.
Trustee Dealings with the Company
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of 2016 Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
16.
No Recourse Against Others
No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, agent or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the 2016 Securities, the Indenture with respect to the 2016 Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, agent or stockholder of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the 2016 Securities, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the 2016 Securities, the Indenture with respect to the 2016 Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of 2016 Securities and Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2016 Securities by accepting a 2016 Security and a Subsidiary Guarantee of the 2016 Securities waives and releases all such liabilities. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the 2016 Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2016 Securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, agent or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the 2014 Securities, the Indenture with respect to the 2014 Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, agent or stockholder of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the 2016 Securities, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the 2016 Securities, the Indenture with respect to the 2016 Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of 2016 Securities and Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2016 Securities by accepting a 2016 Security and a Subsidiary Guarantee of the 2016 Securities waives and releases all such liabilities. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the 2016 Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantees of the 2016 Securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

Registration Under the Securities Act
The Company and the Guarantors shall commence the Exchange Offer by mailing the related Prospectus, appropriate letters of transmittal and other accompanying documents to each Holder stating, in addition to such other disclosures as are required by applicable law, substantially the following:
 
 
 
 
 
As a condition to participating in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be required to represent to the Company and the Guarantors that (i) any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) at the time of the commencement of the Exchange Offer it has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act, (iii) it is not an "affiliate" (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or any Guarantor and (iv) if such Holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Registrable Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities, then such Holder will deliver a Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available a Prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the Company and the Guarantors shall:
 
 
 
The Company and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff.
(b) In the event that (i) the Company and the Guarantors determine that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by December 1, 2007 or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a "Shelf Request") from any Initial Purchaser representing that it holds Registrable Securities that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective, provided, however, that nothing in this section 2(b) shall require the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement prior to the Target Registration Date.
In the event that the Company and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.
The Company and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) (or any similar rule then in force, but not Rule 144A) under the Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Securities or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
 
(c) The Company and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) hereof, has not become effective on or prior to December 1, 2007 (the "Target Registration Date"), the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Target Registration Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becomes effective or the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act, up to a maximum total increase of 1.00% per annum. In the event that the Company receives a Shelf Request pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii), and the Shelf Registration Statement required to be filed thereby has not become effective by the later of December 1, 2007 or (y) 90 days after delivery of such Shelf Request (such later date, the "Shelf Additional Interest Date"), then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period payable commencing from one day after the Shelf Additional Interest Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act, up to a maximum total increase of 1.00% per annum.
If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period commencing on the 31
st
day in such 12-month period and by an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum total additional rate of 1.00% per annum until such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.
(e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that any failure by the Company or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for
 
which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.
(f) The Company represents, warrants and covenants that it (including its agents and representatives) will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Free Writing Prospectus.
3. . (a) In connection with their obligations pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof, the Company and the Guarantors shall as soon as reasonably practicable:
Registration Procedures
(i) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on the appropriate form under the Securities Act, which form (x) shall be selected by the Company and the Guarantors, (y) shall, in the case of a Shelf Registration, be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and (z) shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include all financial statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith; and use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective for the applicable period in accordance with Section 2 hereof;

(ix) in the case of a Shelf Registration, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available) to purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and the Company and the Guarantors shall notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to suspend use of the Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and such Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus until the Company and the Guarantors have amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission;

(xi) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the initial effective date of a Registration Statement;
(xii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be; cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and execute, and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;
(xiii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by a representative of the Holders of the Registrable Securities (an "Inspector"), any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, any attorneys and accountants designated by a majority of the Holders of Registrable Securities to be included in such Shelf Registration and any attorneys and accountants designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and other records, documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, and cause the respective officers, directors and employees of the Company and the Guarantors to supply all information requested by any such Inspector, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; that if any such information is identified by the Company or any Guarantor as being confidential or proprietary, each Person receiving such information shall be required to maintain, and shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect, the confidentiality of such information to the extent such action is otherwise not inconsistent with, an impairment of or in derogation of the rights and interests of any Inspector, Holder or Underwriter;
provided
 
(xiv) in the case of a Shelf Registration, use their reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be listed on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system on which similar securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor are then listed if requested by the Majority Holders, to the extent such Registrable Securities satisfy applicable listing requirements;
(xv) if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement, promptly include in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests to be included therein and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as the Company has received notification of the matters to be so included in such filing;
(xvi) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including those requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (1) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when requested, (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and the Guarantors (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, (3) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent registered public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor, or of any business acquired by the Company or any Guarantor for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder (to the extent permitted by applicable professional standards) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, including but not limited to financial information contained in any preliminary prospectus or Prospectus and (4) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable
 
Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors made pursuant to clause (1) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement; and
(xvii) so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, cause each Additional Guarantor upon the creation or acquisition by the Company of such Additional Guarantor, to execute a counterpart to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Annex A and to deliver such counterpart, together with an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability thereof against such entity, to the Initial Purchasers no later than five Business Days following the execution thereof.
(b) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities (as a condition to such Holder's participation in the Shelf Registration Statement) to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and the Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
(c) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(v)(3) or 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(ix) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantors, such Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(d) If the Company and the Guarantors shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company and the Guarantors may give any such notice only twice during any 365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 30 days for each suspension and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect during any 365-day period.
(e) The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each an "Underwriter") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.
 
4. . (a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
The Company and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
5. . (a) The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state
Indemnification and Contribution
 
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus used in violation of this Agreement or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through JPMorgan or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3 hereof, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others
provided
provided

entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by JPMorgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the
 
Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
pro
rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
6. .
General
(a) The Company and the Guarantors represent, warrant and agree that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Company nor any Guarantor has entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will enter into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or obligation to the Company or the Guarantors with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.
Successors and Assigns.

Registration Under the Securities Act
The Company and the Guarantors shall commence the Exchange Offer by mailing the related Prospectus, appropriate letters of transmittal and other accompanying documents to each Holder stating, in addition to such other disclosures as are required by applicable law, substantially the following:
 
 
 
 
 
As a condition to participating in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be required to represent to the Company and the Guarantors that (i) any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) at the time of the commencement of the Exchange Offer it has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act, (iii) it is not an "affiliate" (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or any Guarantor and (iv) if such Holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Registrable Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities, then such Holder will deliver a Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available a Prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the Company and the Guarantors shall:
 
 
 
The Company and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff.
(b) In the event that (i) the Company and the Guarantors determine that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by December 1, 2007 or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a "Shelf Request") from any Initial Purchaser representing that it holds Registrable Securities that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective, provided, however, that nothing in this section 2(b) shall require the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement prior to the Target Registration Date.
In the event that the Company and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.
The Company and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) (or any similar rule then in force, but not Rule 144A) under the Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Securities or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
 
(c) The Company and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) hereof, has not become effective on or prior to December 1, 2007 (the "Target Registration Date"), the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Target Registration Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becomes effective or the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act, up to a maximum total increase of 1.00% per annum. In the event that the Company receives a Shelf Request pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii), and the Shelf Registration Statement required to be filed thereby has not become effective by the later of December 1, 2007 or (y) 90 days after delivery of such Shelf Request (such later date, the "Shelf Additional Interest Date"), then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period payable commencing from one day after the Shelf Additional Interest Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act, up to a maximum total increase of 1.00% per annum.
If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period commencing on the 31
st
day in such 12-month period and by an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum total additional rate of 1.00% per annum until such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.
(e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that any failure by the Company or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for
 
which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.
(f) The Company represents, warrants and covenants that it (including its agents and representatives) will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Free Writing Prospectus.

(xvi) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including those requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (1) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when requested, (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and the Guarantors (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, (3) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent registered public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor, or of any business acquired by the Company or any Guarantor for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder (to the extent permitted by applicable professional standards) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, including but not limited to financial information contained in any preliminary prospectus or Prospectus and (4) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable
 
Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors made pursuant to clause (1) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement; and
(xvii) so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, cause each Additional Guarantor upon the creation or acquisition by the Company of such Additional Guarantor, to execute a counterpart to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Annex A and to deliver such counterpart, together with an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability thereof against such entity, to the Initial Purchasers no later than five Business Days following the execution thereof.
(b) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities (as a condition to such Holder's participation in the Shelf Registration Statement) to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and the Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
(c) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(v)(3) or 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(ix) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantors, such Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(d) If the Company and the Guarantors shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company and the Guarantors may give any such notice only twice during any 365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 30 days for each suspension and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect during any 365-day period.
(e) The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each an "Underwriter") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.
 
4. . (a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.

(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.

therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus used in violation of this Agreement or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through JPMorgan or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3 hereof, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others

entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by JPMorgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the
 
Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
pro
rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.

(g) The relevant Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the relevant Account Party, by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures.
provided
(h) If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the relevant Account Party shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Account Party reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if the relevant Account Party fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

(i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank (if any, it being understood that a successor Issuing Bank shall not be required if there is more than one Issuing Bank obligated to issue additional Letters of Credit at the time). The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Parent Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b).

After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of an Issuing Bank.
 
(j) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Parent Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Account Parties shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Primary Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposits of cash collateral shall be made in the respective amounts and currencies that correspond to the amounts and currencies of the LC Exposure in respect of each Letter of Credit. Each such deposit pursuant to this paragraph or Section 2.11(b) shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Primary Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Account Parties' risk and expense (unless reasonably objected to by the Parent Borrower in a timely manner), such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Account Parties for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Account Party under this Agreement. If the Account Party is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Account Parties within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Account Party is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Account Party as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Account Party would remain in compliance with Section 2.11(b) and no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
Cash Collateralization.
provided
(k) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the other conditions applicable to the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and the approval of the applicable Issuing Bank, LC Applicants may request the issuance of Local Letters of Credit. Upon the issuance of any Local Letter of Credit, and so long as any Local Letter of Credit remains outstanding, the following provisions shall apply:
Local Letters of Credit.
(i) For purposes of determining the total LC Exposure at any time and for purposes of calculating fees payable under Section 2.12(b), the amount of any
 
Local Letter of Credit and of any LC Disbursements in respect thereof shall be deemed to be, as of any date of determination, the Dollar Amount thereof at such date. The initial Dollar Amount of any Local Letter of Credit shall be determined by the applicable Issuing Bank on the date of issuance thereof and adjusted from time to time thereafter, in each case, as provided below. The Dollar Amount of each Local Letter of Credit outstanding shall be adjusted by the applicable Issuing Bank on each Calculation Date as provided in Section 2.22(a). If an LC Disbursement is made by the Issuing Bank under any Local Letter of Credit, the Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement shall be determined by such Issuing Bank on the date that such LC Disbursement is made. The applicable Issuing Bank shall make each such determination to be made by it by calculating the amount in Dollars that would be required in order for such Issuing Bank to purchase an amount of the applicable Local Currency equal to the amount of the relevant Local Letter of Credit or unpaid LC Disbursement, as the case may be, on the date of determination at the Spot Exchange Rate with respect to such Local Currency on such date of determination. Each applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower promptly of each such Dollar Amount determined by it, on the date that such determination is required to be made.
(ii) Subject to paragraph (iv) below, the obligation of the applicable Account Party to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement under any Local Letter of Credit, and to pay interest thereon, shall be payable only in the Local Currency in which such LC Disbursement is made, and shall not be discharged by paying an amount in Dollars or any other currency; that the applicable Issuing Bank may agree, in its sole discretion, to accept reimbursement in another currency, but any such agreement shall not affect the obligations of the Revolving Lenders or the Account Parties under paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below if such reimbursement is not actually made to the applicable Issuing Bank when due.
provided
(iii) The obligation of each Revolving Lender under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section to pay its Applicable Percentage of any unpaid LC Disbursement under any Local Letter of Credit shall be payable only in Dollars and shall be in an amount equal to such Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Amount of such unpaid drawing determined as provided in paragraph (i) above. Under no circumstances shall the provisions hereof permitting the issuance of Letters of Credit in a Local Currency be construed, by implication or otherwise, as imposing any obligation upon any Revolving Lender to make any Loan or other payment under the Loan Documents, or to accept any payment from any Account Party in respect of any unreimbursed LC Disbursement, in any currency other than Dollars, it being understood that the parties intend all payments of Indebtedness created under the Loan Documents (other than the Local Currency Loans as set forth in this Agreement) to be denominated and payable only in Dollars except as expressly provided in paragraph (ii) above and in Section 2.18(a).
 
(iv) If and to the extent that any Revolving Lender pays its Applicable Percentage of any unreimbursed LC Disbursement under any Local Letter of Credit, then, notwithstanding clause (ii) above, the obligation of the applicable Account Party to reimburse the portion of such unreimbursed LC Disbursement funded by such Revolving Lender shall be converted to, and shall be payable only in, Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar amount funded by such Revolving Lender as provided above) and shall not be discharged by paying an amount in any other currency. Interest accrued on such unreimbursed LC Disbursement to and excluding the date of such payment by such Revolving Lender shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank and be payable in the applicable Local Currency, but interest thereafter shall accrue on the Dollar amount owed to such Revolving Lender and shall be payable in Dollars.
(l) Each Issuing Bank that is not the same Person as the Person serving as the Administrative Agent shall notify the Administrative Agent of (i) the currency, amount (including the Dollar Amount thereof in the case of Local Letters of Credit) and expiration date of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at or prior to the time of issuance thereof, (ii) any amendment or modification to any such Letter of Credit at or prior to the time of such amendment or modification and (iii) any termination, surrender, cancelation or expiry of any such Letter of Credit at or prior to the time of such termination, surrender, cancelation or expiration.
Certain Notices by Issuing Banks.
(m) . LC Applicants may request that an Issuing Bank allow one or more Letters of Credit issued by it to expire later than permitted by clause (ii) of Section 2.05(c). An Issuing Bank may (but shall not have any obligation to) agree to issue such Letters of Credit, provided that no such Letter of Credit shall expire later than the date that is one year after the date of issuance. Any such Letter of Credit is referred to herein as an "". The following provisions shall apply to any Extended Letter of Credit, notwithstanding any contrary provision set forth in this Agreement.
Extended Letters of Credit
Extended Letter of Credit
(i) Subject to paragraph (v) below, the participations of each Revolving Lender in each Extended Letter of Credit shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date, with the effect that the Lenders shall not have any obligations to acquire participations in any LC Disbursement made thereafter (other than in respect of demands for drawings submitted prior to such termination).

Such deposits of cash collateral shall be made in the respective amounts and currencies that correspond to the amounts and currencies of the LC Exposure in respect of each Extended Letter of Credit. Each such deposit shall be held by the applicable Issuing Bank as collateral for the obligations of the relevant Account Party in respect of such
 
Extended Letters of Credit. If an Issuing Bank notifies the Administrative Agent that the relevant Account Party has failed to make such deposit of cash collateral with such Issuing Bank when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the amount equal to 105% of the LC Exposure attributable to such Issuing Bank's Extended Letters of Credit, the deposit of cash collateral then due from the relevant Account Party in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in Dollars equal to its Applicable Percentage of the deposit of cash collateral then due from the relevant Account Party, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders, to be held as cash collateral as provided herein; that (A) no Revolving Lender shall be required to make any such payment to the extent that such payment would result in such Lender's Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment and (B) a Revolving Lender shall be relieved of its participation in any Extended Letters of Credit to the extent of any payments made by it under this paragraph to fund deposits of cash collateral securing such Extended Letters of Credit and accordingly its LC Exposure shall be reduced to the extent of such payment and such reduction shall be taken into account in determining the limitation on a Lender's obligation to fund as described in clause (A) of this proviso. Any amounts so received by an Issuing Bank in Dollars that secure any Local Letters of Credit may, in the discretion of such Issuing Bank, be converted by it to the Local Currency in which such Local Letter of Credit is denominated. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to fund deposits of cash collateral shall constitute an ABR Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. Each Account Party hereby consents to the foregoing and agrees that the amounts paid by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to fund deposits of cash collateral required to secure any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Account Party shall constitute ABR Revolving Loans for its account due on the Revolving Maturity Date.

provided
(iii) The applicable Issuing Bank shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the collateral account in which it holds amounts deposited with it pursuant to sub-paragraph (ii) above. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the applicable Issuing Bank and at the risk and expense of the Account Parties, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the applicable Issuing Bank to reimburse LC Disbursements in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the obligations of the Account Parties owed to such Issuing Bank hereunder. If any Extended Letter of Credit expires or is terminated, then within three Business
 
Days thereafter the relevant Issuing Bank shall return to the relevant Account Party cash collateral then held attributable to such Extended Letter of Credit (after deducting therefrom any amounts owed to such Issuing Bank by the relevant Account Party that are then due).
(iv) Subject to paragraph (v) below, after the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date, the fees that would have accrued pursuant to clause (i) of Section 2.12(b) (if the participations of the Revolving Lenders in the Extended Letters of Credit had not terminated) shall continue to accrue on the LC Exposure in respect of each Extended Letter of Credit and shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank for its own account.
(v) If the participations of the Revolving Lenders in the Extended Letters of Credit terminate five Business Days prior to November 30, 2007, because the 2008 Senior Notes Refinancing Condition has not been satisfied or waived, but the 2008 Senior Notes Refinancing Condition is thereafter satisfied or waived prior to termination of the Revolving Commitments, then, upon the effectiveness of such satisfaction or waiver, the participations of each Revolving Lender in each Extended Letter of Credit shall revive and become effective, the fees described in paragraph (iv) above shall commence to accrue for the accounts of the Revolving Lenders (but any such fees accrued for the accounts of the Issuing Banks during the interim period shall remain for their account) and (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the Issuing Banks shall, within three Business Days thereafter, return to the relevant Account Parties any cash collateral held pursuant to paragraph (iii) above.
(n) All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement for the account of the Global Borrower on and as of the Original Effective Date and shall constitute Letters of Credit for all purposes of the Loan Documents. All other letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement as of the Restatement Effective Date shall continue to constitute Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement on and as of the Restatement Effective Date for all purposes of the Loan Documents.
Existing Letters of Credit.
SECTION 2.06. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan (other then a Local Currency Loan) to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. Each Lender shall make each Local Currency Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., London time (or the time of such other city designated by the Administrative Agent), to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the applicable Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City (or, in the case of any Local
Funding of Borrowings.

provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.07. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable U.S. Borrower, in the case of a Revolving Borrowing, the Canadian Borrower, in the case of a Tranche A Term Borrowing, or the Parent Borrower, in the case of a Tranche A-1 Term Borrowing or Tranche B Term Borrowing, may elect to convert the method of calculating interest in respect of such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as the same Type and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Such Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings or Local Currency Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued; that a Local Currency Loan may be extended by mutual agreement of the relevant Borrower and Lender in respect of such Loan (in which case, at or prior to the effectiveness of such extension, such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent of such extension and of the terms on which such Loan is being extended). Any such election shall not result in a novation and shall not otherwise be considered to result in a repayment and reissue of any Borrowing.
Interest Elections.
provided
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
 
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request containing the information set forth in Section 2.07(c) and signed by such Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Term Borrowing or Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.08. (a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Tranche A-1 Commitments shall terminate on the Restatement Effective Date upon funding of the Tranche A-1 Term Loans, (ii) the
Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
 
Tranche B Commitments shall terminate on the Restatement Effective Date upon funding of the Tranche B Term Loans and (iii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.
(b) The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans or Local Currency Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the total Revolving Exposures plus the Local Currency Loan Exposure would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.
provided
(c) The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments.
provided
SECTION 2.09. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender as provided in Section 2.10, (iii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Local Currency Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (iv) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan owed by such Borrower on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the currency thereof and the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof, the Borrower in respect thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay its Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima facie
provided
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class (or any Local Currency Loan) made by it to any Borrower be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of a promissory note evidencing one or more Local Currency Loans, such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) any event occurs that constitutes a "Prepayment Event" (or would constitute a "Prepayment Event" except by reason of any of the exclusions set forth in the definition of the term "Prepayment Event"), (B) any Loan Party would be required to prepay,

redeem or repurchase (or offer to prepay, redeem or repurchase) any High Yield Senior Notes, 2006 Mosaic Notes or other Material Indebtedness as a result of such event (a "") and (C) the Prepayment Requirement would be avoided or reduced if Borrowings were prepaid instead of applying Net Proceeds therefrom in accordance with the exclusion set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.11(c) or in the definition of the term "Prepayment Event" (or such Net Proceeds are not so applied), then, as and to the extent necessary to avoid or reduce the Prepayment Requirement, the Borrowers shall prepay Borrowings immediately prior to the expiry of any period that, if Borrowings are prepaid during such period, the Prepayment Requirement would be so avoided or reduced.
Prepayment Requirement
(d) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Parent Borrower, commencing with the fiscal year ending May 31, 2006, the Borrowers shall prepay Term Borrowings or Revolving Borrowings (in accordance with paragraph (e) below) in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year; that no such prepayment pursuant to this paragraph will be required with respect to Excess Cash Flow for any fiscal year if the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0 as of the end of such fiscal year.

Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans or Local Currency Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing (other than a Local Currency Loan) shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

(c) The Loans comprising each Local Currency Borrowing shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof (i) in the case of a Negotiated Local
 
Currency Loan, at the interest rate agreed upon by the applicable Revolving Lender and the applicable Borrower, (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate Loan, at the applicable Fixed Rate and (iii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Local Currency Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the applicable Margin.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
provided
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. For the purposes of the (Canada) and disclosure thereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be paid hereunder or in connection herewith is to be calculated on the basis of 360-day year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in such calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 360. The rates of interest under this Agreement are nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this Agreement.
Interest Act
SECTION 2.14. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
 
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
Each Lender shall give notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable after determining that the circumstances referred to in paragraph (b) above applicable to such Lender no longer exist, and the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Parent Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable after the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that the circumstances giving rise to any notice given by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence no longer exist.
SECTION 2.15. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank (without duplication of any amounts paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17), as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Parent Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any such certificate shall be accompanied by an explanation of the circumstances or event that resulted in such claim for compensation. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the relevant Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Parent Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided
provided further
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.15, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital under this Section unless such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, represents to the Parent Borrower that at the time it is the policy or general practice of such Lender or Issuing Bank to demand such compensation for comparable costs or reductions, if any, in similar circumstances, if any, under comparable provisions of other credit agreements for comparable customers.
SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment (including any prepayment) of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan or any Local Currency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan
Break Funding Payments.
 
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered by a Borrower pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or any Local Currency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 or 10.02(c), or (e) the conversion of any Local Currency Loan pursuant to Section 9.01(a), then, in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but excluding loss of margin) attributable to such event; that the foregoing shall not be construed to entitle a Lender of a Local Currency Loan to any such compensation (i) if such Lender shall have agreed that it is not entitled to such compensation or (ii) in excess of the compensation payable pursuant to a separate agreement entered into by such Lender with respect to such Loan, if applicable. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the same currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar or eurocurrency (as applicable) market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
provided
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that a Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any loss, cost or expense incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Parent Borrower of the loss, cost or expense and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.
provided
SECTION 2.17. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
 
(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section but excluding Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Agents, such Lender or the Issuing Banks, as applicable) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Parent Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the applicable Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Parent Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender has received written notice from the Parent Borrower advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.
(f) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (a ""), which in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is allocable to Taxes paid by a Borrower, it shall promptly pay such Tax Refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such
Tax Refund
 
refund) plus any interest paid thereon by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund, net of all taxes and out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender incurred in obtaining such Tax Refund; , , that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender if the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this Section 2.17(f) shall require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information) to the Borrowers or any other Person.

SECTION 2.18. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time or, in the case of an amount payable in a Local Currency, 1:00 p.m. local time at the place of payment), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York (or, in the case of payments in a Local Currency, such other location as provided below), except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, except as expressly provided herein with respect to Local Currency Loans and Local Letters of Credit. All payments to be made by any Borrower in a Local Currency pursuant to Section 2.05(k) or in respect of any Local Currency Loan shall be made in such Local Currency in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such Local Currency for the account of the Administrative Agent at such time and at such place as shall have been notified by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Borrower by not less than four Business Days' Notice.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
 
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent from such Borrower for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such filing, designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Parent Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such filing, designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If (x) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or (y) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or (z) any Lender defaults in its obligations to fund Loans hereunder, or becomes insolvent and its assets become subject to a receiver, liquidator, trustee, custodian or other Person having similar powers, then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Parent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Parent Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Parent Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
 
SECTION 2.20. The Parent Borrower may from time to time designate any Foreign Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Global Subsidiary) to be a Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Election with respect to such Subsidiary. The eligibility of any Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary to borrow or to have Letters of Credit issued for its account hereunder shall terminate when the Administrative Agent receives a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination with respect to such Foreign Subsidiary. Each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Election delivered to the Administrative Agent shall be duly executed on behalf of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary and the Parent Borrower, and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination delivered to the Administrative Agent shall be duly executed on behalf of the Parent Borrower. The delivery of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination shall not affect any obligation of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary theretofore incurred in its capacity as a Borrower, and such Foreign Subsidiary shall continue to constitute a Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary for all purposes hereof (other than the right to borrow Loans or to have Letters of Credit issued for its account) until all its obligations hereunder as a Borrower have been discharged and paid in full. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks of its receipt of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Election or Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination.
Foreign Borrowing Subsidiaries.
SECTION 2.21. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, one or more of the Foreign Borrowing Subsidiaries may borrow Local Currency Loans in the form of Competitive Local Currency Loans, Negotiated Local Currency Loans or any combination thereof; that on the date of the proposed borrowing and after giving effect thereto (i) the Local Currency Loan Exposure shall not exceed the Local Currency Sublimit, (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Exposures and the Local Currency Loan Exposure shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments and (iii) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied. All Local Currency Loans shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Negotiated Local Currency Loan Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

If the Administrative Agent shall not have received a Competitive Bid from any Lender by the time required above, such Lender shall be deemed to have elected not to make a Competitive Bid; that failure by any Lender to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any Competitive Local Currency Loan as part of such Competitive Local Currency Borrowing. A Competitive Bid submitted by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph (iii) shall be irrevocable.
provided
(iv) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower, by facsimile, of all the Competitive Bids made, the Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount and the Interest Period (including the last day thereof) of each Competitive Local Currency Loan in respect of which a Competitive Bid was made and the identity of the Revolving Lender that made each bid by 12:00 noon (A) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Local Currency Borrowing, four Business Days before the Competitive Local Currency Borrowing and (B) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, one Business Day before the proposed Competitive Local Currency Borrowing.

Each Lender and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and any Person that acquires a participation in its interests in any Credit Facility or Local Currency Loan. Each Borrower agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender
Implementation of CAM.
 
any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of new promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Credit Facilities; that the failure of any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
provided
(b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Specified Obligations, and each distribution made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to any Security Documents in respect of the Specified Obligations, shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by a Lender upon or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of a Specified Obligation shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance herewith.
SECTION 9.02. (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit shall not have been reimbursed by the applicable Borrower or with the proceeds of a Revolving Borrowing, each Revolving Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount in Dollars equal to such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage (as notified to such Lender by the Administrative Agent) of such Letter of Credit's undrawn face amount or (to the extent it has not already done so) such Letter of Credit's unreimbursed drawing (in each case, based on the Dollar Amount thereof determined by the Administrative Agent based upon Spot Exchange Rates prevailing at the time, in the case of any Local Letters of Credit), together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to such amount, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account or accounts for each Lender (each, an "") for the amounts received with respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence. To the extent that any amounts received from the Revolving Lenders as provided above relate to Local Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be converted promptly upon receipt by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Local Currency in an amount equal to the undrawn amount of the relevant Local Letter of Credit and, if the amount in Dollars so received by the Administrative Agent from any Revolving Lender attributable to any Local Letter of Credit is for any reason more or less than the amount necessary to produce the required amount of the relevant Local Currency upon such conversion (based upon the actual cost of conversion determined by the Administrative Agent), then either (i) in the case of a shortfall, such Revolving Lender shall, upon request by the Administrative Agent, pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount in Dollars sufficient to make up the shortfall (as determined by the Administrative Agent and notified to such Revolving Lender) or (ii) in the case of an excess, the Administrative Agent shall refund such excess to such Revolving Lender. The Administrative Agent shall deposit in each Lender's LC Reserve Account such Lender's CAM Percentage of the amounts received from the Revolving
Letters of Credit.
LC Reserve Account
 
Lenders as provided above (including the Local Currencies for which any such amounts have been exchanged as provided in the preceding sentence). The Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control over each LC Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in each LC Reserve Account shall be held in such LC Reserve Account until withdrawn as provided in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) below. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and deposited in the LC Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amounts on deposit in respect of each Letter of Credit attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage. The amounts held in each Lender's LC Reserve Account shall be held as a reserve against the LC Exposure, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against any Loan Party or Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary and shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of any Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05.
(b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the applicable Issuing Bank, withdraw from the LC Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to the amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing, deposited in respect of such Letter of Credit and remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts to such Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Revolving Lenders under Section 2.05(e) (but not of the applicable Borrower under Section 2.05(e)). In the event any Revolving Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount to the Administrative Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 9.02, the applicable Issuing Bank shall, in the event of a drawing thereunder, have a claim against such Revolving Lender to the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section 2.05(e), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 9.01. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting Revolving Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the event such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the defaulted amount.
(c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the LC Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in respect of such Letter of Credit and distribute such amount to such Lender. If any amount to be distributed to a Lender pursuant to this paragraph is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the Administrative Agent will, if so requested by such Lender, convert the amount to be distributed to such Lender into Dollars (in accordance with the Administrative Agent's customary foreign exchange procedures) and distribute the resulting amount in Dollars to such Lender; that the Administrative Agent shall not have any liability to such Lender for any loss experienced in connection with such exchange.
provided
(d) With the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank with an outstanding Letter of Credit, any Lender may withdraw the amount
 
held in its LC Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit, to pay over to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank on demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing; that, in the case of a drawing under a Local Letter of Credit, the amount to be paid over to the Administrative Agent shall be paid in the relevant Local Currency or, if in Dollars, in an amount determined by the Administrative Agent to be sufficient to permit the Administrative Agent to exchange such amount for such Lender's CAM Percentage of the relevant Local Currency amount.
provided
(e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its LC Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its amounts in its LC Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (d) above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the Administrative Agent with amounts in its LC Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account.

SECTION 10.02. (a) No failure or delay by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments.
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.23 with respect to an Incremental Facility Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified (unless otherwise specified herein, therein or in such provision) except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the applicable Agent that is a party
 
thereto and the Loan Party, Loan Parties or Foreign Borrowing Subsidiary that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby (other than with respect to default interest owed pursuant to Section 2.13(d), which shall require the consent of the Required Lenders only), (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.10, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby (provided that the 2008 Senior Notes Refinancing Condition may be waived, amended or modified with the written consent of Lenders having Revolving Exposures, Term Loans and unused Commitments representing more than 66

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrowers, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender) if (i) by the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

(c) To the extent that the Primary Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to any Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section (and without limiting the obligation of any Primary Borrower to do so), each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at the time.
provided
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Borrowers shall assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
