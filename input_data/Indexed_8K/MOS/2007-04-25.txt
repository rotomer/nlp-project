The offers, if accepted, would result in new agreements with those executive officers who do not currently have them, and amend and restate existing agreements with each of our other executive officers.
A copy of the forms of the Severance and Change in Control Agreements are attached as Exhibits 10.iii.a. and 10.iii.b. The following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the forms of the Severance and Change in Control Agreements.

General Benefits
In general, upon any termination of employment an executive officer is entitled to amounts earned but that we have not paid.

de minimis
The Severance and Change in Control Agreements also provide that all options, restricted stock units and other equity awards granted under our Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan to the executive officer will immediately vest upon a Change in Control.

[ENTER CITY AND STATE]
, the Company has employed Employee as [] and Employee desires to serve in that capacity;
WHEREAS
ENTER TITLE
Employee is a key member of the management of the Company and is expected to devote substantial skill and effort to the affairs of the Company, and the Company desires to recognize the significant personal contribution that Employee makes and is expected to continue to make to further the best interests of the Company and its shareholders;
WHEREAS,
, as a further term and condition of Employee's employment, the Company desires to provide Employee the opportunity to receive certain benefits upon termination of Employee's employment by the Company without Cause or by Employee for Good Reason, according to the terms, conditions, and obligations set forth below;
WHEREAS
it is desirable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to continue to obtain the benefits of Employee's services and attention to the affairs of the Company. It is desirable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide inducement for Employee (1) to remain in the service of the Company in the event of any proposed or anticipated change in control of the Company and (2) to remain in the service of the Company in order to facilitate an orderly transition in the event of a change in control of the Company;
WHEREAS,
it is desirable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that Employee be in a position to make judgments and advise the Company with respect to proposed changes in control of the Company without regard to the possibility that Employee's employment may be terminated without compensation in the event of certain changes in control of the Company;
WHEREAS,
, Employee understands that Employee's receipt of the benefits provided for in this Agreement depends on, among other things, Employee's willingness to execute a General Release of Claims in favor of the Company upon termination and to agree to and abide by the non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation covenants contained in this Agreement;
WHEREAS
it is desirable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to protect confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company, to prevent unfair competition by former executives of the Company following separation of their employment with the Company and to secure cooperation from former executives with respect to matters related to their employment with the Company; and
WHEREAS,
, Employee understands that nothing in this Agreement limits the Company's right to terminate Employee's employment at any time and for any reason.
WHEREAS
, in consideration of Employee's employment with the Company and the foregoing premises, the mutual covenants set forth below, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Employee and the Company agree as follows:
NOW THEREFORE
1. Nothing in this Agreement guarantees Employee continued employment with the Company or otherwise limits the Company's right to terminate Employee's employment at any time and for any reason. In the event of termination of Employee's employment by the Company without Cause or by Employee for Good Reason (as each term is defined below), however, Employee shall be eligible to receive certain benefits upon satisfaction of certain conditions, as set forth in this Agreement below. Such benefits are not available to Employee under this Agreement in the event of a termination by the Company with Cause, by the Employee without Good Reason, or due to the Employee's death or disability.
Limited Right to Certain Benefits upon Termination.
2. In the event the Company terminates Employee's employment for Cause, the Company's obligations to Employee hereunder shall terminate, except as to amounts already earned by but unpaid to Employee as of the effective date of termination. Employee's continuing obligations to the Company under this Agreement, however, shall remain in full force and effect, including without limitation with respect to non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause means a good faith determination by the Company of an act or omission by Employee amounting to:
Termination by Company for "Cause."
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Employee's employment shall terminate immediately upon Employee's death or upon a finding and declaration by the Company, determined in good faith and subject to applicable law, that Employee is unable to carry out Employee's essential job functions to any substantial degree by reason of illness or disability. In either such case, the Company's obligations to Employee hereunder shall terminate, except as to amounts already earned by but unpaid to Employee, as of the effective date of termination. Employee's continuing obligations to the Company under this Agreement, however, shall remain in full force and effect, including without limitation with respect to non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation.
Termination by the Company Due To Employee's Death or Disability.
4. The Company may elect to terminate Employee's employment without Cause at any time, with or without prior notice to Employee, in which case Employee shall receive amounts already earned by but unpaid to Employee as of the effective date of termination and be eligible for the following additional benefits:
Termination by the Company without Cause.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Employee may terminate Employee's employment with the Company for "Good Reason," which, for purposes of this Agreement shall mean:
Termination by the Employee with "Good Reason."
 
 
Good Reason shall not exist if Employee expressly consents to such event in writing or Employee fails to object in writing to such event within sixty (60) days of its effective date and the Company fails to cure such event within thirty (30) days after written notice from Employee, such notice to describe the basis for Employee's claim of Good Reason and identify what reasonable actions would be required to cure such Good Reason. Employee agrees to continue to perform the duties of Employee's position and to otherwise cooperate with the Company throughout this entire notice period. If Good Reason is not cured by the Company and Employee then terminates employment effective within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Company's cure period, Employee shall receive amounts already earned by but unpaid to Employee as of the effective date of termination and be paid or reimbursed for additional benefits in the same manner as set forth in Sections 4(a) through 4(i) above.
 
6. Employee may elect to terminate Employee's employment at any time and for any reason, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company. Employee agrees to continue to perform the duties of Employee's position and to otherwise cooperate with the Company throughout this entire notice period. The Company may, however, upon receiving such notice of termination, elect to make the termination effective at any earlier time during the notice period. In either case if such termination is without Good Reason, salary and benefits shall be paid to Employee through Employee's effective termination date only, and the Company shall have no further obligation to Employee. Employee's continuing obligations to the Company under this Agreement, however, shall remain in full force and effect, including without limitation with respect to non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation.
Termination by Employee without Good Reason.
7. Upon a Change in Control of the Company, all unvested outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or similar equity based awards granted to Employee shall immediately vest without any further act or requirement of Employee. Notwithstanding anything herein stated, no Change in Control shall occur under subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7 as long as Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), whether directly or indirectly through one or more Cargill Subsidiaries, beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act")), a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the general election of directors of the Company, voting together as a single class (the "Voting Stock"), or more than 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock (or comparable voting equity interests) of the surviving or acquiring corporation or other entity resulting from a Business Combination described in subparagraph (c) or a direct or indirect parent entity of the surviving or acquiring corporation or other entity. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, a "Change in Control" shall occur when
Effect of a Change in Control on Equity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this Section 7, a Cargill Subsidiary shall include any corporation, limited liability company or other entity, a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock (or comparable voting equity interests) entitled to vote in the general election of directors (or persons filling similar governing positions in non-corporate entities) of which is beneficially owned by Cargill directly or indirectly through one or more Cargill Subsidiaries, provided that for purposes of this definition, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed to be a Cargill Subsidiary. For purposes of this Section 7, an affiliate of Cargill is a person or entity directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, Cargill. For purposes of clarity and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, nothing herein shall be construed as constituting a Change in Control if Cargill and/or its affiliates sells or distributes shares of Voting Stock of the Company beneficially owned by such entities to Cargill's stockholders, provided that no single person, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) becomes a beneficial owner of 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company as a result of the sale or distribution.
 
8. In consideration of the opportunity to receive certain benefits in the event of termination of employment by the Company without Cause, Employee agrees, both during Employee's employment and following termination of this Agreement or termination of Employee's employment by either party, at any time, for any reason, as follows:
Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Covenants.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this Section 8, the Company shall include any existing or future subsidiaries of the Company. A subsidiary of the Company shall include a corporation, limited liability company or other entity, a majority of the voting power, the then outstanding shares (or a comparable voting equity interests) entitled to vote in the general election of directors (or persons filling similar governing positions in non-corporate entities) of which is owned by the Company directly or indirectly or individually through another subsidiary of the Company).
9. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions and agreements contained in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, that the services to be rendered by Employee as an employee of the Company are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, that it would be difficult to replace such services and that any violation of Section 8 of this Agreement would be highly injurious to the Company, that Employee's violation of any provision of Section 8 of this
Company Remedies.
 
Agreement would cause the Company irreparable harm that would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages and that the remedy at law for any breach of any of the provisions of Section 8 will be inadequate. Employee further acknowledges that Employee has requested, or has had the opportunity to request, that legal counsel review this Agreement, and having exhausted such right, agrees to the terms herein without reservation. Accordingly, Employee specifically agrees that the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any remedy at law or in equity, to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance for any actual or threatened violation of this Agreement and to enforce the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement, and that such relief may be granted without the necessity of proving actual damages and without necessity of posting any bond. This provision with respect to injunctive relief shall not, however, diminish the right to claim and recover damages, or to seek and obtain any other relief available to it at law or in equity, in addition to injunctive relief.
10. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under Minnesota law, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions. In the event that any provision is held to be overbroad, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent necessary to render the provision enforceable according to applicable law.
