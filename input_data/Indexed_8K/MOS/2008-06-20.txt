PLYMOUTH, MN, June 20, 2008  The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) and Investment Saskatchewan today announced they are seeking a buyer for Saskferco Products Inc. (Saskferco).
"Saskferco is an excellent company and will have an exciting future under new ownership," said Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mosaic. "The sale of Saskferco will allow us to focus on our core businesses of potash and phosphates and to fund the planned expansions of our Saskatchewan potash mines and other non-U.S. assets. We remain fully committed to Saskatchewan and are aggressively pursuing our 5.1 million tonne potash capacity expansion initiative in the province over the next 12 years."
"Saskferco is a strong company that is well positioned for the future," said Minister Lyle Stewart, the Minister Responsible for Investment Saskatchewan. "Provided that a fair value can be obtained, there is no longer any reason for the government to retain its minority ownership position. We expect Saskferco to continue as a vibrant and successful private company in our provincial economy."
There can be no certainty a sale of Saskferco will result from this process. Further announcements will be made as events warrant.
