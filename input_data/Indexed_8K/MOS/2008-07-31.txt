Still struggling to keep up with demand
July 30, 2008
Certain statements contained herein constitute "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the assumptions made in connection with the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they do involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of The Mosaic Company, or industry results generally, to be materially different from those contemplated or projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted (whether express or implied) by such statements.
These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the predictability of fertilizer, raw material, energy and transportation markets subject to competitive market pressures; changes in foreign currency and exchange rates; international trade risks; changes in governmental policy, including but not limited to governmental activities to address rising food and crop nutrient prices; changes in environmental and other governmental regulation; adverse weather conditions affecting operations in central Florida or the Gulf Coast of the United States, including potential hurricanes or excess rainfall; actual costs of asset retirement, environmental remediation, reclamation and other environmental regulation differing from management's current estimates; accidents and other disruptions involving our operations, including brine inflows at our Esterhazy, Saskatchewan potash mine and other potential mine fires, floods, explosions, seismic events or releases of hazardous or volatile chemicals, as well as other risks and uncertainties reported from time to time in The Mosaic Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
