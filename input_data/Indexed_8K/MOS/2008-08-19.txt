Second Half Outlook:
Pedal to the Metal
Market Mosaic is a quarterly newsletter published for our customers, suppliers and stakeholders each February, May, August and November by the Market Analysis group of The Mosaic Company. The February and August issues recap our assessment of the near term outlook for agricultural and crop nutrient markets. The May and November issues provide an in-depth look at topics of special interest to our readers.

We have used a metaphor of an engine to describe the agricultural and crop nutrient outlook in the last several issues of Market Mosaic. We introduced this metaphor in the February 2007 issue. That issue, titled Rewing Up Production Agriculture, concluded that farmers around the globe needed to rev up the powerful engines of production agriculture in order to meet the accelerating demands for food and fuel. The August 2007 issue, titled Hitting On All Cylinders, highlighted the
fundamental strength in agricultural markets and the positive outlook for crop nutrient demand. The February 2008 issue, titled No Let Up, noted that farmers dare not to take their foot off the accelerator despite the record harvest of 2007.
Based on the summer sell-off of all things related to agriculture, bubble proponents no doubt would have nominated Running Out of Gas as the title for this issue! However, after studying the most recent facts, we have boldly titled this issue Pedal to the Metal to describe the still urgent need for farmers to step on the accelerator  even hitting the floorboard  in order boost production in 2009 and build global grain and oilseed stocks to more secure levels.
Rock Solid Agricultural Outlook
Despite the volatility in grain and oilseed prices this spring and summer, agricultural fundamentals remain tight. Markets still are just one weather problem away from the type of crisis hinted at in June when excessive rainfall delayed planting and flooded fields throughout large parts of the U.S. corn belt. The record harvest of 2007 and the prospect of another record crop in 2008 will just stop rather than reverse the decade-long decline in global grain and oilseed stocks. Estimates released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on August 12 show that inventories of the 16 leading grain and oilseed crops are projected to increase a puny 20.7 million tonnes this year compared to projected use of almost 2.58 billion tonnes. Stocks at the end of the 2008/09 crop year are forecast to account for only 16.2 percent of use, the second lowest percentage since 1974/75.
Global grain and oilseed stocks have dwindled due to a pick-up in the pace of demand growth. Growth has accelerated as a result of continued strong income and food demand growth, particularly in the large and rapidly developing countries in Asia, as well as increases in biofuels production, especially the exponential increase in U.S. ethanol output. According to the latest USDA estimates, global grain and oilseed demand is increasing 2.5 percent per year  120 basis points greater than the historical rate.
Farmers have responded to higher grain and oilseed prices by planting more area and intensifying cropping practices. The supply response during the last two growing seasons was good, but not good enough to build global grain and oilseed stocks to secure levels. For example, global grain and oilseed production increased 3.9 percent or 94 million tonnes to a record 2.50 billion tonnes in 2007. Roughly 40 percent of this increase resulted from a 1.5 percent or 13 million hectare increase in harvested area and the other 60 percent was due to a 2.5 percent or 69 kilograms per hectare increase in average yield. Global grain and oilseed production is projected to increase another 4.2 percent or 104 million tonnes to 2.61 billion tonnes in 2008, according to USDA's August estimates. Again, approximately 40  continued inside
 
percent of the expect- ed increase comes from a 1.5 percent or
more than 13 million hectare increase in
harvested area and
the other 60 per-
cent is the result of a 2.6 percent or 73 kilograms per hect- are increase in aver- age yield. Those are
strong back-to-back
gains, but they have L M H barely moved the needle on the gauge measuring global grain and oil-seed stocks.

Although the 2008 crop is not yet in the bin, input suppliers are gearing up for 2009  the crop farmers will plant later this fall and next spring to meet projected demand during the 2009/10 crop year. Input demand prospects continue to look positive due to the fact that grain and oilseed markets will need to coax additional increases in both planted area and yields in order for the 2009 harvest to meet growing demand  let alone build stocks to more secure levels.
We have attempted to bracket the range of potential outcomes for the 2009/10 crop year based on low, medium and high production scenarios. We assume harvested area will increase another 6.7 million hectares for all three scenarios. That is one-half of the large increases during the last two years and it puts harvested area at a record 902 million hectares in 2009.

Three yield scenarios
are considered. The Area and Yield medium scenario as- sumes a yield equal
to the trend for the last 10 years. The low scenario utilizes
a yield equal to the trend less the largest negative deviation
from trend during the last 10 years. The
high scenario uses
growth, equal to the
compound annual growth rate for the
last 10 years.
Global grain and oil- seed stocks decline to less than 400 mil- lion tonnes at the end of the 2009/10 crop year in the medium scenario. Stocks increase to about 450
million tonnes in the
high scenario as a L M H result of ideal growing conditions and slower demand growth. Under the low scenario, stocks drop to less than 325 million tonnes or just 12.4 percent of use, a percentage even less than the low levels of the early 1970s. Based on this analysis, our conclusion is that agricultural commodity markets at some point will demand that farmers put the pedal to the metal in 2009 in order to grow a bumper crop, build stocks to more secure levels and move world agriculture out of this danger zone.

Accelerating Nutrient Demand Growth
Nutrient demand prospects continue to look outstanding given the need to plant more area and increase crop yields. The latest statistics published by the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) in May indicate that global phosphate use is projected to increase 24 percent or 8.9 million tonnes P2O5 from 2006 through 2012. That is a compound annual growth rate of 3.1 percent or 120 basis points higher than the rate of 1.9 percent from 1995 to 2005. Global potash use is forecast to increase 27 percent or 7.0 million tonnes K2O during the same period. That is a compound annual growth rate of 3.5 percent or 120 basis points higher than the rate of 2.3 percent from 1995 to 2005. Closer to home, U.S. phosphate and potash use is forecast to increase from 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 2008/09. This forecast assumes that U.S. farmers will plant more than 90 million acres of corn next spring Million and maintain phos- Tonnes World Phosphate Use phate and potash P2O5

In fact, estimated revenue after variable cost, although off from the expected record for the 2008 crop, is projected to remain at a level more than double the average from 2003 to 2006.
Phosphate Market  Stable
Phosphate prices have stabilized at high levels this summer following the sharp run-up in values earlier this year. The outlook for the second half of 2008 hinges on three factors  agricultural commodity prices, raw materials costs and Chinese exports. Our handicapping of these factors indicates that the market will continue to stay balanced during the last half of the year.

China has played a pivotal role in the global phosphate market during the last 18 months. World processed phosphate (DAP/MAP/TSP) import demand surged 14 percent or 2.7 million tonnes to a record
22.1 million tonnes in 2007. Latin America, led by agricultural pow-erhouses Argentina and Brazil, accounted for about two-thirds of this increase, but every other region  even Western Europe  registered a gain in imports last year.

producers, however, shorted their domestic customers in the process. As a result, Chi-nese planners imposed a 35 percent export tax on all phosphate products on January 1 and subsequently increased the rate to 135 percent on April 20 in order to reduce exports and insure adequate supplies for domestic farmers.
Import demand is forecast to stay about flat this year, but significant changes are expected by region. In particular, a large jump in imports by India and a recovery of demand in Australia are projected to offset decreases in imports by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico this year.

In Australia, the potent mix of rain and high wheat prices has produced a strong recovery in demand and imports this year. Processed phosphate imports are projected to climb to 1.14 million tonnes in 2008, up from 0.87 million last year and up from just 0.59 million two years ago.
In Latin America, import demand is projected to drop 14 percent or almost 1.0 million tonnes in 2008. Some of the hefty increases in imports last year were carried over into this year. In addition, the restart of the Fertinal plant has reduced Mexican imports this year. On the supply side, we estimate that Chinese processed phosphate exports likely will drop 35 percent in 2008. Although the export tax is

Battle for Acres in 2009
Lumping 16 different crops into a single category provides a useful overview of global agriculture, but it also masks important developments in key commodity markets. However, the same scenario analysis for the four main grain and oilseed crops yields the same conclusion  farmers will have to grow a bin-buster crop in 2009 in order to prevent inventories of these commodities from falling in 2009/10.

scheduled to drop to 35 percent on October 1, most analysts expect that authorities will extend or even increase the tax through at least the fourth quarter. Chinese authorities appear serious about promoting food security and fighting food inflation. The expected decline in Chinese exports creates a hole that U.S. and other producers will need to fill, especially during the last half of this year. For example, China exported as much DAP/MAP during the first half of 2008 as it did during the first half of 2007. So, the entire decline in DAP/MAP exports is expected to take place during the second half of this year. In particular, we project that China will export less than one million tonnes of DAP/MAP during the last half of this year compared to 2.5 million tonnes during the last half of 2007.
U.S. producers exported just less than 7.0 million tons of DAP/MAP during the fertilizer year that ended on June 30, 2008. We forecast that U.S. exports will increase 12 percent or 860,000 tons to more than 7.8 million tons in 2008/09 due to continued strong demand and the expected loss of Chinese exports.

On the domestic front, U.S. DAP/MAP shipments climbed to a record of more than 7.8 million tons in 2007/08, an increase of nine percent or about 670,000 tons from a year earlier. U.S. phosphate use, however, likely declined one to two percent last year due to the drop in corn acreage. Producers clearly shipped more tonnage to distributors than what farmers applied in 2007/08, but some re-stocking was needed given the hard flush of the pipeline during the two previous years.
U.S. phosphate use is forecast to increase about 2.5 percent in 2008/09 due to the expected rebound in corn acreage. U.S. DAP/ MAP shipments are forecast to remain at high levels in 2008/09. In fact, shipments are projected to decline about one percent to 7.7 million tons, a drop of less than one percent and the second highest level in recent history.

Inventories of DAP/MAP held by U.S. producers at both on- and off-site facilities have declined to low levels during the last two years. Producers reported holding 1.11 million tons of DAP/MAP at both on- and off-site facilities on July 31, 2008. That was 17 percent more than a year ago but nine percent less than two years ago and in line with the three year average. Based on the above forecasts, U.S. DAP/MAP producer stocks are forecast to stay at low levels throughout the 2008/09 fertilizer year.
Potash Supply Struggles to Keep Up with Surging Demand
The potash market remains extremely tight as mines continue to struggle to keep up with surging demand. Prices took another large step up this summer and likely will move to levels that are required to ration some demand and allocate available supplies to their highest value uses.
After jumping 16 percent in 2007, world import demand is projected to increase another two percent in 2008  despite the fact
that Chinese imports plunged 51 percent during the first half of the year and are projected to drop more than 30 percent for the entire year. Demand prospects next year look even better given the likelihood of timely settlements of 2009 contracts and record shipments to Chinese customers as well as continued strong demand in other key importing countries.
High grain and oilseed prices and profitable farm economics for many potash-intensive crops such as palm oil, rice and soybeans have stoked demand in the large importing countries in Asia and Latin America. Brazil imported 6.7 million tonnes of potash (KCL) in 2007, up 32 percent from the lower level of 2006, and imports are forecast to increase another seven percent or almost one-half million tonnes to 7.2 million tonnes in 2008. Imports during the first half of 2008 totaled 3.7 million tonnes, up 22 percent or more than 660,000 tonnes from the same period a year ago. The latest statistics from the Fertilizer Association of India (FAI) show that India has stepped up potash imports this year. It is no coincidence that India is growing a

bin-buster crop this year due to more intensive and balanced nutrient use along with the benefits of another good monsoon. India imported almost 2.8 million tonnes of potash (KCL) during the first half of 2008, up a whopping 92 percent or 1.3 million tonnes from the first half of 2007. Imports for the entire year are projected to climb to 4.9 million tonnes.
Chinese potash imports are projected to decline to 6.4 million tonnes KCL in 2008, down from a record 9.4 million tonnes last year. However, 2.5 million of the 3.0 million tonne decline took place during the first half of this year. The sharp drop in imports this year coupled with improving demand prospects is expected to deplete the Chinese pipeline by year end. As a result, we project that China will import near record volumes next year. Canadian offshore exports increased six percent to a record 7.0 million tons K2O (or approximately 10.4 million tonnes KCL) in 2007/08. Offshore shipments are projected to increase another nine percent to 7.7 million tons K2O (or about 11.4 million tonnes KCL) in 2008/09.
On the domestic front, potash demand and shipments declined slightly but remained at high levels in 2007/08. We estimate that U.S. agricultural use dropped one to two percent due to less corn acreage. North American potash shipments or the total amount of potash pushed into the distribution pipeline by
producers and importers dropped about one percent to 6.9 million tons K2O in 2007/08.
North American shipments are forecast to increase 5.5 to 6.0 percent to 7.3 million tons K2O in 2008/09 due to projected increases in U.S. and Canadian agricultural and industrial demand as well as a small re-stocking of a depleted distribution pipeline. North American potash output increased six percent to a
record 13.4 million tons K2O in 2007/08. Mines sputtered last fall and again this spring when producers stepped on the accelerators to boost production to meet speeding demand. In particular, production in October, November, April and June barely exceeded the three year averages for these months despite recent expansions by all three producers. Total shipments are projected to increase to 15.3 million tons K2O in 2008/09 (8.0 million tons of exports and 7.3 million tons of domestic shipments). We estimate that
North American production will increase another 10 percent to 14.7 million tons K2O in 2008/09 due to the start-up of additional capacity this summer and more consistent operating rates at existing mines. Imports and further small declines in producer stocks are expected to make up the 600,000 ton K2O difference.
Stocks held by producers at both on- and off-site facilities declined to just 715,000 tons K2O on July 31. That was the lowest level for this date in 18 years and it was the lowest month-end total since August 2004. Producer stocks are projected to remain at extremely low levels throughout the 2008/09 fertilizer year based on these demand and supply forecasts. Producers will have to manage supply chains with even lower stocks than last year or price will need to ration some demand. Either way, we expect that supply will struggle to keep up with projected demand.
