(e) Compensatory Arrangement for Named Executive Officers
On December 3, 2009, The Mosaic Company (the "Company") paid a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") in the amount of $1.30 per share of common stock to stockholders of record on November 12, 2009.
On December 9, 2009, in order to address the dilutive effects of the Special Dividend on employees who are participants in the Company's long-term equity incentive program, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company approved anti-dilution payments to employees (other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President) who hold stock options or restricted stock units ("RSUs") granted under the Company's 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (or under a similar predecessor company plan). The anti-dilution payments are in lieu of other anti-dilution adjustments under the applicable provisions of the plans. On November 10, 2009, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved similar anti-dilution payments to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, and, upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, approved similar payments to non-employee directors who hold stock options or RSUs granted by the Company (or a predecessor company).
The anti-dilution payments consist of cash payments of $1.30 for each share of common stock subject to outstanding stock options or RSUs (other than RSUs granted in 2008 and 2009 that include dividend equivalent rights).
For stock options and RSUs that are not currently vested, the payments will be made in the year in which the stock options or RSUs vest.
Payments to the Named Executive Officers identified in the Company's proxy statement dated August 25, 2009 for its 2009 annual meeting of stockholders are set forth in the following table:
