Item 8.01. Other Events.
On January 31, 2011, Skipper Grassing, Inc. (the "Independent Contractor"), an independent contractor unrelated to The Mosaic Company ("Mosaic"), was issued an "imminent danger order" (the "Order") by the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, under Section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to stop certain activity that the Independent Contractor was conducting at the Four Corners, Florida, phosphate rock mine of Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC ("Mosaic Fertilizer"). Mosaic Fertilizer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mosaic. The activity that was the subject of the Order was that an employee of the Independent Contractor was allegedly working where there was a danger of falling from the top of a trailer load of hay bales that was 8-1/2 feet from the ground, without wearing a safety belt and safety line. A citation was also issued to the Independent Contractor in connection with the Order. No order or citation was issued to Mosaic Fertilizer in connection with this matter.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
