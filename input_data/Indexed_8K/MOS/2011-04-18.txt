Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On April 13, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The Mosaic Company approved our replacement of senior management severance and change-in-control agreements with executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer and President) that have expired or are expiring. On April 14, 2011, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Committee, approved:
 
 
The Board and the Committee believe that the new agreements reflect emerging best practice by, among other changes, eliminating a "gross-up" payable under earlier agreements in the event of any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the Code.
The new agreements set forth the terms and conditions upon which our executive officers would be entitled to receive certain benefits upon termination of their employment:
 
 
 
 
 
General Benefits
In general, upon any termination of employment an executive officer is entitled to amounts earned but that we have not paid. These amounts generally include:
 
 
 
 
 
Benefits upon Termination by Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason
In addition, in the event of termination by us without cause or by an executive officer for good reason, the executive officer is entitled to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amounts payable would be reduced by the amount of other compensation the executive officer receives from us as an employee, independent contractor or consultant during the twelve months following termination of employment, as well as by any compensation under any other severance plan of ours.
Benefits Following Change-in-Control
In the event of termination by us without cause or by an executive officer for good reason:
 
 
 
 
 
then the executive officer is entitled to the same benefits as discussed under " except that:
Benefits upon Termination by Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason,"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the payments to an executive officer under the agreement together with amounts under other agreements or plans would subject the executive officer to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits payable to the participant would be reduced if doing so would result in the best net benefit to the executive officer.
Description of Key Terms
For purposes of the severance and change-in-control agreements, in general:

The severance and change-in-control agreements require our executive officers to:
 
 
 
The severance and change-in-control agreements prohibit the executive officers from:
 
 
 
 
Duration of Severance and Change-in-Control Agreements
The new agreements will expire March 31, 2014 unless renewed by us and the executive officer, except that following a change in control the term will extend to at least the second anniversary of the change in control. The earlier severance and change-in-control agreements, to the extent not yet expired, including an agreement with Mr. James ("Joc") C. O'Rourke that is currently scheduled to expire in June 2012, will be terminated upon agreement of the parties to new agreements.
