Item 8.01. Other Events.
On June 27, 2011, Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC ("Mosaic Fertilizer"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Mosaic Company ("Mosaic"), was issued an "imminent danger order" (the "Order") by the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (the "DOL"), under Section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("MSHA"), to stop certain activities that Mosaic Fertilizer was allegedly conducting at its Wingate, Florida, phosphate rock mine: two miners were on the deck of a crane attaching a lifting chain to a hoist hook in preparation for lifting a dredge cutter head from the ground onto a floating work platform, and in danger of falling six feet to the ground. The miners were removed from the deck of the crane.
In addition, in connection with the Order, the DOL issued Mosaic Fertilizer a citation under Section 104(a) of MSHA because the two miners were allegedly not wearing safety belts and lines and the crane was not equipped with attachment points for a lifeline.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
