Press Release
On January 10, 2012 Marathon Petroleum Corporation issued a press release announcing certain projections with regard to its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011. The press release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FINDLAY, Ohio, Jan. 10, 2012  Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) today announced that the company expects to report a small loss for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to fourth quarter 2010 net income of $230 million, or $0.64 per share.
The fourth quarter 2011 results were negatively impacted by the rapid increase in the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. During the quarter, the prompt WTI price increased $19.63 per barrel, from $79.20 on Sept. 30, 2011 to $98.83 on Dec. 30, 2011. This increase in WTI price impacted the cost of the majority of the crudes MPC processed in the fourth quarter. In addition, refined product market prices did not increase sufficiently to offset the higher crude oil costs during the fourth quarter of 2011.
MPC is finalizing the fourth quarter results and currently plans to announce fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results on Feb. 1, 2012.
