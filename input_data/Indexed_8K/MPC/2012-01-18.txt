For purposes of this Section 2.10(b) with respect to the Annual Meeting next following the end of the year 2011, a notice of any Stockholder's nomination shall be considered timely if delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on February 10, 2012; that the nominating Stockholder or its representative shall have timely requested the form of written questionnaire and form of written representation and agreement referenced in Section 2.10(e) not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed proxy materials for the immediately preceding Annual Meeting to stockholders (which such first anniversary date is deemed to be March 11, 2012 as set forth in Section 1.10(a)).
