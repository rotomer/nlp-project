Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
As previously confirmed press accounts have indicated, turnaround activities are underway at the 206,000 barrel per day Robinson, Illinois petroleum refinery of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (the "Company"). Since early June 2012, certain of the Robinson refinery processing units have been undergoing planned maintenance that was previously scheduled to commence in July 2012. The impacted units at the Robinson facility are now expected to return to service by mid July 2012. As a result of the acceleration of this turnaround activity, the Company anticipates that its second quarter 2012 total throughput volume will average approximately 60,000 barrels per day less and its second quarter 2012 crude throughput volume will average approximately 90,000 barrels per day less across its six refinery system than the previously forecasted 1.4 million and 1.3 million barrels per day, respectively.
It is the Company's practice to expense turnaround costs in the period in which they are incurred. Consequently, the Company anticipates an increase in operating costs for the second quarter of 2012 compared to its prior guidance. As a result of the increase in turnaround expenses and throughput changes mentioned above, on a per barrel of total throughput basis, the Company anticipates direct operating costs in its Refining & Marketing segment gross margin to be approximately $5.45 per barrel, up from the $4.87 per barrel previously forecasted.
