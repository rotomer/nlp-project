Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims

The parties hereto expressly agree that the applicable Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final, non-appealable judgment that such Issuing Bank was grossly negligent or acted with willful misconduct in connection with such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(g) . Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.

Disbursement Procedures

(h) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that (i) if the Borrower makes such reimbursement on the date such LC Disbursement is made, interest shall accrue for such day if such reimbursement is made after 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such day and (ii) if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.

If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(c), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the Aggregate Commitments and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.19, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower as promptly as practicable to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, no Issuing Bank shall have any exposure in respect of any outstanding Letter of Credit that is not fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or the remaining cash collateral and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the Loans comprising such Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender shall both pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 2.07. . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Borrowings of Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone, fax or electronic mail by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such
 
telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Borrower, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, notifies the Borrower of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.08. . (a) Unless previously terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date (as it may be extended with respect to some or all of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.20); , , that the Commitments shall terminate on September 14, 2012 at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, if the Effective Date shall not have occurred on or before such time.

accordance with Section 2.10, the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitments as a result thereof.
(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the closing of one or more securities offerings, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima facie
provided
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and substantially in the form of Exhibit D. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
SECTION 2.10. . (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
Prepayment of Loans
(b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone, fax or electronic mail (and, in the case of telephonic notice, promptly confirmed by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day as the date of prepayment, or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day as the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

If any such excess remains after prepayment in full of the aggregate outstanding Loans, the Borrower shall provide cash collateral in the manner set forth in Section 2.05(j) in an amount equal to 100% of such excess.
SECTION 2.11. . (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount (if any) by which the Commitment of such Lender exceeds the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; that any commitment fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

provided
(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.000% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.000% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate
 
shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.13. . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any ABR Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Revolving Borrowing.
SECTION 2.14. . (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank;
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section, the Borrower will pay to such Recipient such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Recipient for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding
 
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered; that such Lender or such Issuing Bank is generally seeking, or intends generally to seek, compensation from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Lender or Issuing Bank has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect to such Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements.
provided

The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower in writing of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; , that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (but not including the Applicable Rate applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the

SECTION 2.16. . (a) . Each payment by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.

(b) . The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
(c) .

The indemnity under this paragraph shall be paid within 20 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
Indemnification by the Loan Parties
(e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this paragraph shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document from any other source against any amount then due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph.
Indemnification by the Lenders
 
(f) .

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.16(f)(ii)(A) through (F) and Section 2.16(f)(iii) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnifying party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
(h) . For purposes of Sections 2.16(e) and 2.16(f), the term "Lender" includes any Issuing Bank.
Issuing Bank
 
SECTION 2.17. . (a) Except as provided in Section 2.05(e), the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. The Borrower shall make each reimbursement of LC Disbursements required to be made by it prior to the time for such payments set forth in Section 2.05(e). Any amounts received after the time set forth above or in Section 2.05(e), as applicable, on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to such account in the United States as it may specify from time to time, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including any payment made by the Borrower in connection with any extension of the Maturity Date in accordance with Section 2.20 or any Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.21) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Sections 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations to such Person under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.18. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.18(a), (ii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iii) any Lender refuses to consent to any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof that requires the unanimous approval of all Lenders, or the approval of each of the Lenders affected thereby (in each case in accordance with Section 9.02), and the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained with respect to such amendment, modification, waiver or consent, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent with respect to any assignee that is not already a Lender hereunder (and if a Commitment or LC Exposure is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and
provided
 
Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (D) in the case of any such assignment resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and any contemporaneous assignments and consents, the applicable amendment, modification, waiver or consent can be effected and (E) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto (it being understood and agreed that such Lender shall not be deemed to make the representations and warranties in such Assignment and Assumption if such Lender has not executed such Assignment and Assumption).
SECTION 2.19. . Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the provisions set forth in the following paragraphs (a) through (e) shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
(a) commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders (or each Lender) or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification providing for an increase in such Defaulting Lender's Commitment, providing for an extension of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment (other than in determining whether the Required Lenders have consented to the extension of the Maturity Date under Section 2.20) or requiring the consent of each Lender affected thereby (including pursuant to Sections 9.02(b)(ii) and (iii)) if such Defaulting Lender is an affected Lender;
provided
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:
(i) the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Section 2.04(c)) and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Sections 2.05(d) and 2.05(e)) shall be reallocated (effective as of the date such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (for the purposes of such reallocation, such Defaulting Lender's Commitment shall be disregarded in determining the Non-Defaulting Lenders' respective Applicable Percentages), but only to the extent that (A) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments, (B) after giving effect to any such reallocation, no Non-Defaulting Lender's
 
Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment and (C) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, within three Business Days following the Borrower's receipt of written notice from the Administrative Agent, (A) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure that has not been reallocated and (B) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Banks only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure that has not been reallocated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then all Letter of Credit participation fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's reallocated LC Exposure shall be payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages after giving effect to such reallocation; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit participation fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's unreallocated LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Banks, ratably based on the portion of such LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank, until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above;
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure, as applicable, will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein);
(e) in the event that a Bankruptcy Event with respect to any Lender Parent shall have occurred following the Effective Date and for so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit, and the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan, unless such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or the applicable Lender reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder;
 
(f) in the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposures and LC Exposures of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment, and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; and
(g) the rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.19 are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that the Administrative Agent and each Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party may at any time have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.
SECTION 2.20. . (a) At least 30 days prior to, but not more than 90 days prior to, any anniversary of the Effective Date, the Borrower, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, may request an extension of the Maturity Date to the date that is one year after the then existing Maturity Date (such existing Maturity Date, the ""). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall, in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days after delivery of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, notify the Administrative Agent in writing as to whether such Lender consents to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Maturity Date not later than 20 days after the delivery of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, such Lender shall be deemed to have not consented to such extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the consents received with respect to the Borrower's request for an extension of the Maturity Date. The Maturity Date may be extended pursuant to this Section 2.20 on no more than two separate instances during the term of this Agreement.
Extension of Maturity Date

It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Borrower for any requested extension of the Maturity Date.
provided
(c) If, pursuant to Section 2.20(a), the Borrower requests an extension of the Maturity Date and Lenders constituting the Required Lenders consent to such request, then the Borrower may, at any time after the day that is 27 months prior to the Maturity Date in effect at such time, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), require any Non-Extending Lender, promptly following notice to such Non-Extending Lender and the Administrative Agent, to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to a willing assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) and will agree to the applicable request for extension; that (i) unless the assignee is already a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Non-Extending Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.

Promptly following the applicable Existing Maturity Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders (including each assignee pursuant to Section 2.20(c)) of such extension of the applicable Existing Maturity Date and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Extending Lender and each such assignee.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Availability Period and the Maturity Date (without taking into consideration any extension pursuant to this Section), as such terms are used in reference to any Issuing Bank or any Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender or any Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Lender, may not be extended without the prior written consent of such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender shall not have consented to any such extension, (i) such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, hereunder through the applicable Existing Maturity Date (or the Availability Period determined on the basis thereof, as applicable), and thereafter shall have no obligation to issue, amend, extend or renew any Letter of Credit or to make any Swingline Loan, as applicable (but shall, in each case, continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.04, 2.05, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03, as applicable, as to Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans issued or made prior to such time), and (ii) the Borrower shall cause the Total LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and the Swingline Exposure to be zero no

Each of the Lenders and each of the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as the Administrative Agent to act as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or an Issuing Bank as any other Lender or Issuing Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties), (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose the Administrative Agent to liability or is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final, non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent was grossly negligent or acted with willful misconduct in taking or not taking any such action. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
provided
 
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof). The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facility as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); that no approval of the Borrower shall be necessary if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.
provided
If the Person serving as the Administrative Agent becomes a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent (the effectiveness thereof being subject to the following sentence) and appoint a successor in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after delivery of such notice (or such earlier day as shall be agreed to by the Required Lenders) (the ""), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal
Removal Effective Date
 
Effective Date, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such removal, (a) the removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the removed Administrative Agent, that (i) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (ii) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the Administrative Agent shall also directly be given or made to each Lender and each Issuing Bank.
provided
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Any resignation or removal of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or its successor as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute the resignation or removal of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or its successor as Swingline Lender, and any successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to this Section shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swingline Lender for all purposes hereunder. In such event, the Borrower shall prepay any outstanding Swingline Loans (together with payment of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon) made by the retiring or removed Administrative Agent in its capacity as Swingline Lender.
Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Effective Date that has been made available by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders.
Each Arranger and each institution identified as a "Syndication Agent" or "Documentation Agent" with respect to this Agreement shall have no obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity.

Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, promptness, presentment, demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest, notice of acceptance and any other notice in respect of the Obligations or any part of them, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any defense of payment in full in cash of the Obligations.

Each Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrower and any endorser and other guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal, and each Guarantor hereby
 
agrees that no Guarantied Party shall have any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to it regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Guarantied Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to any Guarantor, such Guarantied Party shall be under no obligation (a) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (b) to disclose any information that such Guarantied Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (c) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to any Guarantor.
Until the Obligations have been paid in full in cash (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations (other than contingent obligations in respect of Letters of Credit, excluding Letters of Credit that have been cash collateralized in the manner reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank or with respect to which other arrangements have been made that are satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank) not then due and payable and as to which no claim has been made as of the time of determination) and the Commitments have expired or have been terminated, the Guarantors shall not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of the Guarantied Parties or any part of them against the Borrower or any right of reimbursement, indemnity or contribution or similar right against the Borrower by reason of this Guarantee or by any payment made by any Guarantor in respect of the Obligations. No failure on the part of the Borrower or any other Guarantor or Grantor to make the payments required by Article III hereof (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor and Grantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of and separate from the Obligations. Upon any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against any Guarantor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Obligations then due, without first proceeding against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Obligations, or joining the Borrower or any other guarantor in any proceeding against any Guarantor.
Subject to Article XV below, this Guarantee shall be irrevocable as to the Obligations (or any part thereof) until the Commitments have expired or have been terminated, the Obligations have been paid in full in cash (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations not then due and payable and as to which no claim has been made), all Letters of Credit have expired or terminated (or have been cash collateralized in the manner reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank or with respect to which other arrangements have been made that are satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank) and all LC Disbursements have been reimbursed, at which time this Guarantee shall automatically be cancelled. Upon such
 
cancellation and at the written request of any Guarantor or its successors or assigns, and at the cost and expense of such Guarantor or its successors or assigns, the Administrative Agent shall execute in a timely manner a satisfaction of this Guarantee and such instruments, documents or agreements as are necessary or desirable to evidence the termination of this Guarantee. Any execution and delivery of the instruments, documents and agreements by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article X shall be without recourse or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the Obligations held by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates which are then due and payable, irrespective of whether or not such Lender. Issuing Bank or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Guarantee and although any of the Obligations is owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or such Issuing Bank different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Article XI are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender, such Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees to promptly notify the applicable Guarantor and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application by such Lender, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

Article X
XV
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrower and any endorser and other guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal, and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that no Guarantied Party shall have any duty to advise any Subsidiary Guarantor of information known to it regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Guarantied Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Guarantied Party shall be under no obligation (a) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (b) to disclose any information that such Guarantied Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (c) to

Article III
The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder are independent of and separate from the Obligations. Upon any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against any Subsidiary Guarantor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Obligations then due, without first proceeding against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Obligations, or joining the Borrower or any other guarantor in any proceeding against any Subsidiary Guarantor.

Upon such cancellation and at the written request of any Subsidiary Guarantor or its successors or assigns, and at the cost and expense of such Subsidiary Guarantor or its successors or assigns, the Administrative Agent shall execute in a timely manner a satisfaction of this Guaranty and such instruments, documents or agreements as are necessary or desirable to evidence the termination of this Guaranty. Any execution and delivery of the instruments, documents and agreements by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this shall be without recourse or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
