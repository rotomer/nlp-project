Upon reasonable advance written notice, BP Products shall have the right, with respect to each Annual Earnout Period, at BP Product's sole cost and expense, to conduct one audit of the records of Buyer to verify the calculation of the Monthly Volumes during each Annual Earnout Period, and such audit must be completed no later than forty-five (45) Business Days following the provision by the Buyer to BP Products of the Annual Earnout Statement.

If the resulting calculation of the Annual Earnout Amount exceeds the corresponding Annual Cap, then such Annual Earnout Amount shall be deemed to equal the corresponding Annual Cap, and none of the excess will be carried over to subsequent Annual Earnout Periods. For the avoidance of doubt, each year the Annual Earnout Period Gross Margin shall be calculated without taking into account any excess or shortfall of the Annual Earnout Amount that may have resulted from any prior year's calculation.

Furthermore, if Buyer is conducting Remedial Work for which it is responsible under and subsequently discovers the presence of a substance that would support an indemnification claim for costs to perform additional Remedial Work necessitated by the presence of such substance (the "") against the Seller but the Additional Remedial Work Costs arising out of or relating to such additional Remedial Work would nonetheless be addressed by Buyers' conduct of the underlying Remedial Work, then no indemnification claim for such Additional Remedial Work Costs may be brought by the Buyer against the Sellers as a result of its subsequent discovery of the presence of such substance. If Buyer is conducting Remedial Work for which Sellers have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement and subsequently discovers the presence of a substance that would, at the time of such discovery, support a separate and independent indemnification claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party against Sellers pursuant to this (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes the time limitations for asserting indemnification claims set forth herein), such additional indemnification claim for additional Remedial Work shall be deemed to have been included in the scope of the original indemnification claim brought by the Buyer Indemnified Party against Sellers.
