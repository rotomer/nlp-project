ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Schering-Plough today issued a press release titled "Schering-Plough Reports Financial Results for 2004 Fourth Quarter, Full Year" and provided additional supplemental financial data. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this 8-K. The supplemental financial data is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this 8-K. ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. Disclosure Notice for Forward Looking Statements This 8-K, including each exhibit, the comments of Schering-Plough officers during our earnings teleconference/webcast on January 25, 2005 at 8:00 am (EDT), and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. They use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "intend," "plan," "potential," "will," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events, circumstances or future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions, ability to access the capital markets, prospective products, the status of product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, development programs, estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, expenses and programs to reduce expenses, the cost of and savings from reductions in work force, the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations, growth strategy and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements here or in other publications may turn out to be wrong. Actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about Schering-Plough's financial and operational performance or the performance of Schering-Plough stock. Schering-Plough does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from Schering-Plough's forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following:
- - A significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the United States. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. - - Competitive factors, including technological advances attained by competitors, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors coming to the market, new indications for competitive products, and generic, prescription and/or OTC products that compete with products of Schering-Plough or the Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals joint venture (such as competition from OTC statins, like the one approved for use in the U.K. for which impact in the cholesterol reduction market is not yet known). - - Increased pricing pressure both in the United States and abroad from managed care organizations, institutions and government agencies and programs. In the United States, among other developments, consolidation among customers may increase pricing pressures and may result in various customers having greater influence over prescription decisions through formulary decisions and other policies. - - The potential impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003; possible other U.S. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, including Medicaid and Medicare, involuntary approval of prescription medicines for over-the-counter use; and other health care reform initiatives and drug importation legislation. Legislation or regulations in markets outside the U.S. affecting product pricing, reimbursement or access. Laws and regulations relating to trade, antitrust, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls and possible nationalization. - - Patent positions can be highly uncertain and patent disputes are not unusual. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively impact sales of existing products or result in injunctive relief and payment of financial remedies. - - Uncertainties of the FDA approval process and the regulatory approval and review processes in other countries, including, without limitation, delays in approval of new products. - - Failure to meet Good Manufacturing Practices established by the FDA and other governmental authorities can result in delays in the approval of products, release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. The resolution of manufacturing issues with the FDA discussed in Schering-Plough's 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, including the timing, scope and duration of a resolution of the manufacturing issues, will depend on the ability of Schering-Plough to assure the FDA of the quality and reliability of its manufacturing systems and controls, and the extent of remedial and prospective obligations undertaken by Schering-Plough.
- - Difficulties in product development. Pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach market for numerous reasons. They may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing, they may fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, they may turn out not to be economically feasible because of manufacturing costs or other factors or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others. - - Post-marketing issues. Once a product is approved and marketed, clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance may raise efficacy or safety concerns. Whether or not scientifically justified, this new information could lead to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products, which may negatively impact sales. Concerns of prescribers or patients relating to the safety or efficacy of Schering-Plough products, other companies' products or pharmaceutical products generally, may also negatively impact sales. - - Major products such as CLARITIN, CLARINEX, INTRON A, PEG-INTRON, REBETOL Capsules, REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX accounted for a material portion of Schering-Plough's 2004 revenues. If any major product were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, OTC availability of the Company's product or a competitive product (as has been disclosed for CLARITIN and its current and potential OTC competition), previously unknown side effects; if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced; generic availability of competitive products; or if the product is discontinued for any reason, the impact on revenues could be significant. Also, such information about important new products, such as ZETIA and VYTORIN, or important products in our pipeline, may impact future revenues. Further, sales of VYTORIN may negatively impact sales of ZETIA. - - Unfavorable outcomes of government (local and federal, domestic and international) investigations, litigation about product pricing, product liability claims, other litigation and environmental concerns could preclude commercialization of products, negatively affect the profitability of existing products, materially and adversely impact Schering-Plough's financial condition and results of operations, or contain conditions that impact business operations, such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs. - - Economic factors over which Schering-Plough has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. - - Instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region - due to the location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or customers - regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. - - Changes in tax laws including changes related to taxation of foreign earnings. - - Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that would require a significant change to Schering-Plough's accounting practices.

[Schering-Plough Letterhead] EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATELY Media Contact: Steve Galpin, Jr. (908) 298-7415 Investor Contacts: Alex Kelly Janet M. Barth (908) 298-7436 SCHERING-PLOUGH REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2004 FOURTH QUARTER, FULL YEAR KENILWORTH, N.J., Jan. 25, 2005 - Schering-Plough Corporation (NYSE: SGP) today reported financial results for the 2004 fourth quarter and full year. "We made enormous progress on the Stabilize and Repair phases of our six-to-eight year Action Agenda," said Fred Hassan, Schering-Plough chairman and CEO. "In 2004, the company managed severe top-line challenges while making critical investments in our long-term future. As we go into 2005, we are seeing the beginnings of top-line growth, with quarterly sales comparisons gradually moving into positive territory. In my experience, it is exceptionally challenging to turn negative sales momentum into positive performance. We are proud of this accomplishment. We now intend to drive this trend into bottom-line growth - through excellent execution, strategic investments, cost consciousness and sales dynamism. And we continue to anticipate beginning a turnaround later this year." Hassan highlighted some of Schering-Plough's major accomplishments in 2004 to transform the company into a long-term, high-performance competitor: - The on-time U.S. approval in July and successful launch of the cholesterol-lowering medicine VYTORIN while growing ZETIA to $1 billion in sales; - Continued progress in fulfilling consent decree obligations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), completing 161 of 212 significant steps and 22 of 33 validation actions without incurring any additional payments for missed deadlines; - Resolution of several major legacy issues, including the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the U.S. Department of Justice; - Gaining greater financial flexibility by strengthening its balance sheet through the successful issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in August; and
- 2 - - Expanding the company's product line and research portfolio through internal R&D advances and licensing and strategic agreements with Bayer, Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. and ViroPharma Incorporated. "On the product front, the year's major milestone was without question the on-time U.S. approval and the successful launch of the cholesterol-lowering medicine VYTORIN," said Hassan. "With its dual inhibition of the two sources of cholesterol, VYTORIN offers patients a powerful new treatment option for reducing cholesterol levels." He said VYTORIN is being well accepted by managed care organizations, reflecting the product's unique profile and attractive value proposition of high efficacy and competitive pricing. "We estimate that VYTORIN has open or second tier managed care access for more than 75 percent of all U.S. covered lives, which is a huge accomplishment in such a short time frame," added Hassan. "It is also worth noting that at this time last year, we reported that ZETIA sales were annualizing at more than $600 million. Now, with Vytorin launched, sales of our cholesterol franchise are annualizing at significantly in excess of $1 billion. ZETIA and VYTORIN represent two of the industry's major product launches in recent years. The cholesterol market is well - -established and the success of our cholesterol franchise remains pivotal to our turnaround." he said. VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), a new once-daily, cholesterol-lowering therapy marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), contains ZETIA (ezetimibe), a cholesterol-absorption inhibitor discovered by Schering-Plough, and Merck's Zocor (simvastatin) statin product. VYTORIN is the first single tablet to provide powerful LDL cholesterol reduction through dual inhibition of the two sources of cholesterol by inhibiting the production of cholesterol in the liver and blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine, including cholesterol from food. VYTORIN has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol by 52 percent at the recommended starting dose (10/20 mg) and 60 percent at the maximum dose (10/80 mg). In head-to-head trials, VYTORIN provided superior reductions in LDL cholesterol versus current market leaders atorvastatin (Pfizer's Lipitor(R)) and simvastatin (Zocor) across the dosing range. Results of a clinical trial reported in October 2004 showed that 82 percent of high-risk patients taking VYTORIN achieved their LDL goal of less than 100 versus only 47 percent for Lipitor at the usual starting doses of each therapy. Schering-Plough achieved further progress in broadening its product portfolio with several regulatory actions in 2004. The company's PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy for hepatitis C in December became the first pegylated interferon combination therapy to be available in Japan. Other products gaining approvals for additional indications or formulations included REMICADE, a treatment for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, in the European Union (EU) and, in the United States, the allergy medicines NASONEX and CLARINEX. In addition, U.S. and EU regulatory applications were filed seeking marketing approval for the systemic antifungal posaconazole and for a new indication for the brain cancer treatment TEMODAR. Throughout the year, Schering-Plough aggressively pursued cost reductions and greater efficiencies while working to upgrade the company's global infrastructure. "We reinvested much of
- 3 - those savings, and I believe that a key factor in the success of the VYTORIN launch was the investment we made in advance to expand and train our U.S. sales force," he said. "During 2004, we did what we said we would do," he said. "We go into 2005 with much accomplished and still much work ahead." On the growing public concern about the general safety of medicines, Hassan commented, "Today our entire industry confronts a special challenge in the form of new, heightened caution among regulators, prescribers and patients. In this new environment, our fundamental commitment to building business integrity, quality and compliance in the New Schering-Plough is especially relevant." Regarding the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the company offered the following comment: "We are pleased by the passage of this important legislation," said Hassan. "While this legislation will require a tax charge, it will also allow us to repatriate significant foreign funds for productive purposes in the United States, in line with the intent of the legislation," he added. FOURTH QUARTER 2004 RESULTS Schering-Plough reported a net loss available for common shareholders of $856 million in the 2004 fourth quarter or 58 cents in diluted loss per common share compared with a loss in the 2003 period of $181 million or 12 cents per share. The net loss available for common shareholders and loss per share in the 2004 fourth quarter reflected a tax provision of $807 million, or 55 cents per share, relating primarily to the recently enacted tax legislation - the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 - which allows companies to repatriate funds held by foreign subsidiaries to the United States at a much-reduced tax rate. Fourth quarter 2004 net sales of $2.2 billion were 12 percent higher than the 2003 period and included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4 percent. The fourth quarter sales increase was led by U.S. and international product growth, the sales contribution from Bayer products and the positive impact from currency exchange. The company noted that net sales under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) does not include sales of the cholesterol products marketed in partnership with Merck, as the company accounts for the cholesterol joint venture under the equity method as described below. Global cholesterol joint venture net sales, which include VYTORIN and ZETIA, totaled approximately $400 million in the 2004 fourth quarter, up more than 140 percent from approximate net sales of $163 million in the comparable 2003 period. U.S. cholesterol joint venture net sales for the period totaled $333 million compared with $144 million in 2003, up 131 percent. VYTORIN (also marketed as INEGY and ZINTREPID) has now been approved in 25 countries, including the United States, and ZETIA (also marketed as EZETROL and ZIENT) in 72 countries. Overall, the company shares in approximately 50 percent of the profits of the joint venture with Merck, although there are different profit sharing arrangements for the cholesterol
- 4 - products in countries around the world. Accordingly, including an adjustment of an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales (see note and table below), Schering-Plough's adjusted net sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 would have totaled $2.4 billion, an increase of $354 million or 17 percent, as compared to $2.0 billion on a similar adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2003. The company utilizes the equity method of accounting for its cholesterol joint venture with Merck. Under the equity method, the company records its share of the operating profits less its share of the research and development costs in "Equity income from cholesterol joint venture." "Equity income from cholesterol joint venture" for Schering-Plough totaled $98 million in the 2004 fourth quarter versus $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The company noted that it incurs substantial costs, such as selling, general and administrative costs, that are not reflected in "Equity income from cholesterol joint venture" and are borne by the overall cost structure of Schering-Plough. On a reported basis, fourth quarter 2004 sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals, which do not include sales of the cholesterol joint venture, totaled $1.7 billion, up 15 percent, with a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4 percent. Consumer Health Care sales declined 4 percent to $217 million. Animal Health sales grew 8 percent to $230 million, reflecting solid growth across core brands and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 5 percent. Among prescription products recording higher sales in the 2004 fourth quarter were TEMODAR, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, and REMICADE, a treatment for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders that Schering-Plough markets in countries outside the United States (excluding Japan and certain Far East markets) for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. TEMODAR sales totaled $150 million in the 2004 fourth quarter, up 72 percent, benefiting from increased market penetration. Sales for REMICADE rose 33 percent to $212 million, due primarily to greater demand and expanded indications. Also posting higher sales in the quarter was CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma, up 25 percent to $40 million, largely as a result of increased use in treating breast cancer. Also contributing to 2004 fourth quarter net sales growth were products under the strategic agreement with Bayer, which became effective on Oct. 1, 2004. Under the agreement, Schering-Plough gained exclusive rights in the United States and Puerto Rico to market, sell and distribute Bayer's AVELOX and CIPRO antibiotics and to undertake Bayer's U.S. commercialization activities for the erectile dysfunction medicine LEVITRA under Bayer's co-promotion agreement with GlaxoSmithKline PLC. In the Japanese market, Bayer will co-market Schering-Plough's cholesterol absorption inhibitor ZETIA when approved. Sales of the Bayer products totaled $91 million in the quarter, reflecting harmonization of trade inventory practices coupled with a mild respiratory season. Schering-Plough records its share of LEVITRA results as alliance revenue within net sales.
- 5 - In the company's prescription allergy business, global CLARINEX sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $162 million, up 22 percent. Sales of CLARINEX outside the United States rose 38 percent to $55 million in the fourth quarter due to market share gains and continued conversion from prescription CLARITIN. U.S. CLARINEX sales increased 15 percent to $107 million, benefiting from favorable comparisons of trade inventory adjustments. Global NASONEX sales rose 10 percent to $145 million, with U.S. sales climbing 5 percent to $81 million. In international markets, NASONEX sales were up 17 percent to $64 million as a result of market share gains and market growth. Although the company's hepatitis C products showed signs of market share stabilization in the 2004 fourth quarter, product sales declined versus the year-ago period due to ongoing competition in a contracting market and increased U.S. generic competition for REBETOL. Fourth quarter global sales of PEG-INTRON were down 15 percent to $138 million; sales of REBETOL were down 51 percent to $49 million. In Consumer Health Care, sales of OTC CLARITIN were down 22 percent to $75 million, primarily reflecting increased private label competition. Sales of foot care products rose 16 percent to $79 million, benefiting from higher sales of DR. SCHOLL'S FREEZE AWAY wart remover product. The company's gross margin at 62.1 percent for the 2004 fourth quarter was flat compared to the 2003 period. Schering-Plough said its ongoing focus on operational excellence in all key functions, including compliance and quality, continues to increase the overall cost structure of the company. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 25 percent to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus the prior year, primarily reflecting the previously announced field force expansions to prepare for the U.S. launch of VYTORIN and the addition of more than 800 Bayer sales representatives, coupled with increased promotional spending and Bayer integration costs. Research and development spending for the 2004 fourth quarter totaled $406 million, up 3 percent. The "Other, net" line primarily reflects higher interest expense from increased borrowings stemming from the long-term debt issued in the 2003 fourth quarter, offset by higher interest income related to higher cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from the August 2004 issuance of $1.4 billion in Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company recorded a tax provision of $807 million, which includes an accrual for tax at the reduced rate under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This Act applies a tax rate of 5.25 percent on qualifying repatriations of funds versus the normal tax rate of 35 percent. The company intends to repatriate approximately $9.4 billion of previously unremitted foreign
- 6 - earnings under the Act. Also included in the fourth quarter tax provision is a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets resulting from changes in company tax planning strategies triggered by the opportunity to take full advantage of the Act. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The company also offered the following summary of recent significant developments, including: - Launched PEG-INTRON in Japan for use in combination with REBETOL Capsules for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C - the first and only pegylated interferon-based combination therapy available in Japan (announced Dec. 10, 2004). An estimated 1.5 to 2 million Japanese are chronically infected with hepatitis C. - Reached an agreement with NeoGenesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., (announced Jan. 20, 2005) for Schering-Plough to acquire most of NeoGenesis' assets, subject to normal closing conditions. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. NeoGenesis is a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on applying novel screening and chemistry technologies to discover and develop small molecule drugs. Schering-Plough and NeoGenesis have had a research collaboration since 1999. - Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals announced on Nov. 9, 2004, a large scale clinical outcomes trial to be conducted for VYTORIN. The trial, known as IMPROVE IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: VYTORIN Efficacy International Trial), will evaluate the risk reduction provided by VYTORIN 10/40 mg as compared to Zocor (simvastatin) 40 mg in reducing death and major coronary events in approximately 10,000 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The intent of the study is to evaluate the incremental reductions in cardiovascular events in these patients that VYTORIN may provide as compared to simvastatin alone. - Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals announced on Oct. 28, 2004, results from a clinical trial conducted in 1,902 patients with high cholesterol showing that VYTORIN provided greater reduction in LDL ("bad") cholesterol across the dosing ranges compared to Lipitor. At the most commonly used starting doses of these two therapies, VYTORIN 10/20 mg decreased LDL cholesterol by 51 percent compared with 36 percent for Lipitor 10 mg (p<0.001). The results were presented at the 15th International Symposium on Drugs Affecting Lipid Metabolism (DALM), in Venice, Italy. - Gained U.S. approval for use of NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age and older (announced Dec. 15, 2004). This represents the first and only FDA-approval of a nasal inhaled steroid for the treatment of this condition prior to
- 7 - surgery. - Reported U.S. availability of new scent-free, alcohol-free formulation of NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg. (announced Jan. 12, 2005). - Reported results on Oct. 31, 2004, of a pivotal investigative clinical study of posaconazole oral suspension for invasive fungal infections, which showed that posaconazole was successful in treating a wide range (20 species) of fungal infections and may have broad clinical use in the treatment of infections when other therapies have failed. The results were reported at the 44th Annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC). - Expanded CLARITIN nonsedating antihistamine line in Japan with the introduction of instantly dissolving CLARITIN REDITABS (announced Nov. 24, 2004). - Received six-month priority review from FDA (announced Oct. 29, 2004) of a Supplemental New Drug Application for TEMODAR in the treatment of gliomas, a form of brain tumors. The application was submitted to FDA in September 2004. - Filed an application with the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) (announced Nov. 3, 2004) seeking centralized Marketing Authorization in the European Union (EU) for the use of TEMODAL Capsules (sold as TEMODAR in the United States) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as adjuvant treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme is a form of brain tumor.
