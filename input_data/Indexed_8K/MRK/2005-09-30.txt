Disclosure Notice The information in this FAQ contains certain "forward-looking" statements, including statements relating to the timing of clinical trials and the status of the completion of work required under the FDA Consent Decree. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from Schering-Plough's forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements may be affected by general market and economic factors, uncertainties in the regulatory approval process, federal and state regulations and legislation, and other uncertainties described in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings under the heading "Disclosure Notice" including the company's second quarter 2005 10-Q. The company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
