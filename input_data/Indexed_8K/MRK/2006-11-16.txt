At the Schering-Plough Corporation 2006 Annual Meeting of shareholders, a shareholder proposal was considered that read:
Earlier this year, Schering-Plough committed to conduct a survey on shareholder wishes on this matter in order to be clear about whether shareholders voting in favor of the resolution wanted any supermajority voting requirements reduced, or intended something else. In order to ensure that all shareholders who wish to be heard on this matter have a chance to do so, Schering-Plough has posted the survey on its Web site at www.schering-plough.com. Shareholders are requested to send the survey for receipt no later than Tuesday, December 12, 2006.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
