ITEM 5.02 .
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Effective December 20, 2006, Schering-Plough entered into a new change of control employment agreement with Robert J. Bertolini, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This agreement replaces the change of control employment agreement between Schering-Plough and Mr. Bertolini dated as of November 17, 2003, which expired.
Under the agreement, a three-year employment term (or a term lasting until age 65, if sooner) is triggered upon a change of control of Schering-Plough. During the change of control employment term, Mr. Bertolini is entitled to a position, authority, responsibilities, compensation and benefits commensurate with what he was entitled to before the change of control.
If, during the change of control employment term, Mr. Bertolini's employment with Schering-Plough is terminated or his position changed, then Mr. Bertolini may be entitled to receive additional amounts, depending upon the reason for the termination, as specified in the change of control employment agreement.
The change of control employment agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Mr. Bertolini's Letter Agreement dated November 4, 2003, which governs the terms of his employment other than following a change of control, continues in effect and is unchanged. It was included as Exhibit 10(e)(iii) to the 2005 10-K.

Exhibit 99.1
     AGREEMENT by and between Schering-Plough Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (the "Company") and Robert J. Bertolini (the "Executive"), dated as of the 19 day of December, 2006. This Agreement is a restatement of and supersedes and replaces the change of control Employment Agreement between the Company and the Executive dated as of November 17, 2003. This Agreement does not alter the terms of the letter agreement between the Company and the Executive dated November 4, 2003 regarding the terms of the Executive's employment with the Company, which letter agreement remains in full force and effect.
th
     The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
     NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
     1. .
Certain Definitions
     (a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.
     (b) The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the date hereof and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 1(a), the date the Executive's employment terminates for any reason prior to the Effective Date; provided, however, that commencing on the third anniversary of the date hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as a "Renewal Date"), the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate on the earlier of (x) the day prior to the first anniversary of the most recent Renewal Date and (y) except as otherwise provided in Section 1(a), the date the Executive's employment terminates for any reason prior to the Effective Date, provided, however, that the Change of Control Period shall not be automatically
 
extended if at least three months prior to the next Renewal Date the Company shall have given notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended.
     2. . For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean:
Change of Control
     (a) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company where such acquisition causes such Person to own 20% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not be deemed to result in a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition directly from the Company, (ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company or (iv) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this Section 2; and provided, further, that if any Person's beneficial ownership of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities reaches or exceeds 20% as a result of a transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above, and such Person subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of additional voting securities of the Company, such subsequent acquisition shall be treated as an acquisition that causes such Person to own 20% or more of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities; or
     (b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
     (c) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or consolidation or similar corporate transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination
 
(including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or
     (d) Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
     3. . The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the earlier of (x) the third anniversary of such date and (y) the Executive's 65th birthday (the "Employment Period").

During the Employment Period it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

Death or Disability
 
to the definition of Disability set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement of its intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 30 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative.
     (b) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
Cause
          (i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
          (ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
     (c) . The Executive's employment maybe terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:
Good Reason
          (i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a) of this Agreement, or any
 
other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
          (ii) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
          (iii) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date;
          (iv) any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
          (v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 12(c) of this Agreement; or
          (vi) a change in the status of the person to whom the Executive reports from the CEO of a publicly-traded company to the CEO of a non-publicly traded company.
For purposes of this Section 5(c), any good faith determination of "Good Reason" made by the Executive shall be conclusive.
     (d) . Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 13(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
     (e) . "Date of Termination" means (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of
Date of Termination
 
death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.
     6. . (a) . If, during the Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than for Cause or Disability or the Executive shall terminate employment for Good Reason:

               (A) the sum of (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) the product of (x) the higher of (I) the Recent Annual Bonus and (II) the Annual Bonus paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which has been earned but deferred (and annualized for any fiscal year consisting of less than twelve full months or during which the Executive was employed for less than twelve full months), for the most recently completed fiscal year during the Employment Period, if any (such higher amount being referred to as the "Highest Annual Bonus") and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is 365 and (3) any compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (1), (2), and (3) shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and
               (B) the amount equal to the product of (1) the lesser of (x) three and (y) the number of days after the Date of Termination and on or before the Executive's 65th birthday, divided by 365, times (2) the sum of (A) the Executive's Annual Base Salary, (B) the Highest Annual Bonus and (C) the highest contributions made under the Company's Employees' Profit Sharing Incentive Plan and the Company's Profit Sharing Benefits Equalization Plan or any successor or replacement plans thereto, for any of the three calendar years preceding the Date of Termination; and
               (C) an amount equal to the excess of (a) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing actuarial assumptions no less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the Company's Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date), and any excess or supplemental retirement plans in which the Executive participates (together, the "SERP") which the Executive would have received if the Executive's employment had continued for three years after the Date of Termination or through age 65, if sooner, assuming for this purpose that all accrued benefits were fully vested, and, assuming that the Executive's compensation in each of the three years (or the shorter period to age 65, if applicable) would have been that required by Section 4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii), over (b) the actuarial equivalent of the Executive's actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the Date of Termination;
          (ii) for the lesser of (x) three years after the Executive's Date of Termination and (y) the period through the Executive's 65th birthday, or such longer period as may be
 
provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 4(b)(iv) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families, provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period;
          (iii) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits");
          (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any employee pension benefit plan or any supplemental or excess employee pension benefit plan of the Company (including without limitation the Retirement Plan, the SERP, the Company's Retirement Benefits Equalization Plan (the "BEP") or any successor or replacement plan thereto), all benefits payable to the Executive under any supplemental or excess employee pension benefit plan of the Company (including without limitation the SERP, the BEP or any successor or replacement plan thereto) following a Change of Control (as defined therein) if, on the Date of Termination, the Executive is then age 50 or over shall not be reduced by any "reduction factors" or similar formulae or otherwise because such benefits are payable prior to a specified age or because the Executive has not yet reached a specified age (including, without limitation, the Executive's earliest or normal retirement age under the terms of the relevant plan);
          (v) consistent with the employment agreement between the Company and Executive dated November 4, 2003, any actuarial adjustment in respect of the Executive's accrued benefit under the SERP for early retirement prior to age 50 will be determined using the same reduction factors from age 50 as is applicable under the SERP's pre-age 62 reduction schedule (e.g. a reduction factor for one year for benefits payable at age 49; a reduction factor for five years for benefits payable at age 45); and
          (vi) in addition to the benefits provided in subparagraph (a)(ii) of this Section 6, if the Executive is age 45 or over on the Date of Termination, the Executive shall, upon attainment of age 55 and upon termination of the three year period after the Executive's Date of Termination, become eligible for all benefits under medical plans, practices, policies and programs made available immediately prior to the Date of Termination (or, if greater, immediately prior to the Effective Date) to retired peer executives of the Company (including without limitation any supplemental coverage under the Executive Medical Benefits Plan) as if
 
the Executive had at the Date of Termination satisfied the age and service conditions for coverage under the applicable provisions of such plans, practices, policies and programs. If the Company is unable to provide the Executive with coverage under such plans, practices, policies and programs, the Company shall provide the Executive with separate comparable coverage but in no event less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of such plans, practices, policies and programs in effect for retirees immediately prior to the Effective Date.
     (b) . If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 6(b) shall include, without limitation, and the Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company and affiliated companies to the estates and beneficiaries of peer executives of the Company and such affiliated companies under such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to death benefits and survivor benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other peer executives and their beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive's estate and/or the Executive's beneficiaries, as in effect on the date of the Executive's death with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their beneficiaries.
Death
     (c) . If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits.

With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 6(c) shall include, without limitation, and the Executive shall be entitled after the Disability Effective Date to receive, disability and other benefits at least equal to the most favorable of those generally provided by the Company and its affiliated companies to disabled executives and/or their families in accordance with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to disability, if any, as in effect generally with respect to other peer executives and their families at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in effect at any time thereafter generally with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families.
Disability
     (d) . If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive other than the obligation to pay to the Executive (x) his Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination, (y) the amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Executive, and (z) Other Benefits, in each case to the extent theretofore unpaid. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or
Cause; Other than for Good Reason
 
provision of Other Benefits. In such case, all Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.
     7. . Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor, subject to Section 13(f), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
Non-exclusivity of Rights
     8. . The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Full Settlement
     9. .
Certain Additional Payments
     (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (each, a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax, the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment ("Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 9 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
 
     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Deloitte & Touche or such other certified public accounting firm that is serving as the Company's primary independent auditors at the time (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts or does not seek to pursue its remedies pursuant to Section 9(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
     (c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
          (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
          (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
          (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
 
          (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax, income tax or other tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such advance; and further provided, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
     (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c), if applicable) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding.
     10. . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, if, based on Internal Revenue Service guidance available as of the date
Code Section 409A Provisions
 
the payment or provision of any amount or other benefit is specified to be made under this Agreement or elsewhere, the Company reasonably determines that the payment or provision of such amount or other benefit at such specified time may reasonably be expected to subject the Executive to "additional tax" under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to, or in connection with, such tax, a "409A Tax") with respect to the payment of such amount or the provision of such benefit, and if payment or provision thereof at a later date would likely avoid any such 409A Tax, then the payment or provision thereof shall be postponed to the earliest business day on which the Company reasonably determines such amount or benefit can be paid or provided without incurring any such 409A Tax (the "Delayed Payment Date"). In addition, if the Company reasonably determines that such 409A Tax with respect to the provision of a benefit can likely be avoided by replacing the benefit with the payment of an amount in cash equal to the cost of a substantially equivalent benefit then, in lieu of providing such benefit, the Company may make such cash payment, subject to the preceding sentence. In the event a benefit is to be provided during the period commencing on the Executive's separation from service and ending on the Delayed Payment Date and the provision of such benefit during that period would be treated as a payment of nonqualified deferred compensation in violation of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then continuation of such benefit during that period shall be conditioned on payment by the Executive of the full premium or other cost of coverage and as of the Delayed Payment Date the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the premiums or other cost of coverage paid by the Executive, which but for this paragraph would have been paid by the Company. Any such reimbursement shall include interest at the rate set out in the last sentence of this Section. The Company and the Executive may agree to take other actions to avoid the imposition of 409A Tax at such time and in such manner as permitted under Section 409A. In the event that this Section 10 requires a delay of any payment, such payment shall be accumulated and paid in a single lump sum on the Delayed Payment Date together with interest for the period of delay, compounded monthly, equal to the prime or base lending rate then used by CitiBank, N.A., in New York City and in effect as of the date the payment would otherwise have been provided.
     11. . The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
Confidential Information

     (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
     (c) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
