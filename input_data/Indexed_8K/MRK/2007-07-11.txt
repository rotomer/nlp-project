Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws: Change in Fiscal Year
The Board of Directors of Schering-Plough Corporation adopted Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective July 10, 2007. The purpose of the amendments, which do not require shareholder approval, was to reflect the expiration of its existing shareholders' rights plan, often known as a "poison pill" provision.
In addition to ending the existing "poison pill" provision, the Board of Directors also amended the Corporate Governance Guidelines to provide that no new shareholder rights plan will be adopted in the future unless the plan is submitted to shareholders for approval within 12 months after its adoption.
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Schering-Plough's website at www.schering-plough.com.

Any vacancy caused by the death or resignation of a director who shall have been elected by the holders of Preferred Shares as a class pursuant to this Section 5(c) may be filled only by the holders of outstanding Preferred Shares at a meeting called for such purpose by the Corporation. The provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Corporation relating to the convening and conduct of special meetings of shareholders and the nomination of directors will apply with respect to any special meeting of the holders of Preferred Shares; that the notice of the nomination need only be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation not more than 10 days after the Corporation (or the holders of 10% of the outstanding Preferred Shares, if applicable) has notified the holders of Preferred Shares of the date of the special meeting to elect the initial Preferred Stock Directors,

          (6) . (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and before any amount shall be paid or distributed with respect to holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock at the time outstanding will be entitled to receive, out of the net assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to shareholders, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $50.00 per share, subject to adjustment as provided for in Section 18(c), plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, for the portion of the then-current Dividend Period until the payment date and all prior Dividend Periods and such Holders shall be deemed to be the Holders of record for such Dividend Periods or portions thereof.

The Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding and the holders of any such securities then outstanding shall
 
share ratably in any distribution of assets upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The amount allocable to each series of such securities then outstanding will be based on the proportion of their full respective liquidation preference to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each such series.

No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 14, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such effective date. Prior to such effective date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.
          (c) Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this Certificate of Amendment, or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, will resume the status of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance.
          (d) In the event that a Holder of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such shares should be registered or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder of such Convertible Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the address of such Holder shown on the records of the Corporation.

(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury of the Corporation, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 12(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
Reservation of Common Stock

Fractional Shares
          (b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 7 hereof, any conversion at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 9 hereof or a conversion at the option of the holder pursuant to Section 8 or Section 10 hereof, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of:
          (i) in the case of a conversion pursuant to Section 7 or Section 9 hereof or a Merger Early Conversion pursuant to Section 10, the Current Market Price; or
          (ii) in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Closing Price of the Common Stock determined as of the second Trading Day immediately preceding the effective date of conversion.
          (c) If more than one share of the Convertible Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered.
 
          (14) . (a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion shall be subject to the following adjustments.
Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates
               (i) . In case the Corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this subsection (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation.
Stock Dividends and Distributions
                (ii) . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
Subdivisions, Splits and Combinations of the Common Stock
                (iii) . In case the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans), entitling such holders, for a period of up to 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of
Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights
 
Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this clause (iii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation.
               (iv) . (A) In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 14(a)(i) or Section 14(a)(ii) hereof, any rights or warrants referred to in Section l4(a)(iii) hereof, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation, and any dividend of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in Section 14(a)(iv)(B) below), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this clause (iv)(A) is applicable, clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) shall not be applicable.
Debt or Asset Distribution
                (B) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying each Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) will occur on the 15th Trading Day from, but excluding, the "ex-date" with respect to the Spin-Off.
                (v) . In case the Corporation shall distribute cash to all holders of the Common Stock immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying such Fixed
Cash Distributions
 
Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the shareholders of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination minus the amount per share of such dividend or distribution; , that no adjustment will be made to either Fixed Conversion Rate for (i) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 14(e) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (iv) of this Section 14(a), (ii) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (iii) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or (iv) any cash dividends on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (x) $0.055 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (y) $0.22 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the ""). The Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to an inversely proportional adjustment whenever the Fixed Conversion Rates are adjusted, that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this clause (v) or clause (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of this Section 14(a).

Dividend Threshold Amount
provided
                If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause (v) as a result of a distribution that is a quarterly or annual dividend, the adjustment shall be based upon the amount by which the distribution exceeds the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly or annual dividend, the adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of such distribution.
                (vi) . In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares (as defined below in this Section)) of an aggregate consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that exceeds the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which (the "") tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day after the date of the Expiration Time, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day after the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn) at the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of cash plus the Fair Market Value of the aggregate

In case any Person other than the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer in which, as of the last time (the "") that tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it shall have been amended), the Board of Directors is not recommending rejection of the offer, then each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Offer Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which will be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to all holders of Common Stock based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Offer Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding less any such Accepted Purchased Shares and the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time and (B) the denominator of which will be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, including any such Accepted Purchased Shares, and the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time. Such adjustment shall become effective as of the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day following the Offer Expiration Time.
Third Party Tender Offers and Exchange Offers

Accepted Purchased Shares
                The adjustment referred to in this clause (vii) will only be made if (1) the tender offer or exchange offer is for an amount that increases the offeror's ownership of common stock to more than 30% of the total shares of Common Stock outstanding; and (2) the cash and Fair Market Value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time.
                However, the adjustment referred to in this clause will not be made if as of the Offer Expiration Time, the offering documents disclose a plan or an intention to cause the Corporation to engage in a consolidation or merger or a sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets. In the event the offeror is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but such Person is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to what would have been in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
 
                (viii) . To the extent that the Corporation has a rights plan in effect on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation of such rights as if the Corporation made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in clause (iv) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
Rights Plans
          (b) . The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 14, if the Board deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
Adjustment for Tax Reasons
provided
          (c) . (i) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share (or, if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share) of Common Stock. Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; , that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; that on the Mandatory Conversion Date, adjustments to the Conversion Rate will be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date. If an adjustment is made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v), l4(a)(vi), 14(a)(vii) or 14(b), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 7(b) will apply on the Conversion Date. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), l4(a)(iv), 14(a)(v), 14(a)(vi) or 14(a)(vii) or 14(b) and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment; , that if such adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), l4(a)(v), l4(a)(vi) or l4(a)(vii) or 14(b) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Conversion Rate.
