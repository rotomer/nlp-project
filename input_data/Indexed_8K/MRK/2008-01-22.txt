Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and unaudited pro forma condensed statements of combined operations as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006 have been prepared on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as U.S. GAAP, and applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the combined historical financial statements of and Organon BioSciences N.V., referred to as Organon BioSciences or the OBS Group, as the case may be, and which comprise the former human and animal health businesses of Akzo Nobel N.V. The sale of the OBS Group by Akzo Nobel N.V. to Schering-Plough closed on November 19, 2007 (the Acquisition Date). Organon BioSciences' historical audited combined financial statements as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and the historical unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements as of and for the six month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, each of which have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, referred to as IFRS, have been filed with the SEC as part of Schering-Plough's registration statement on Form S-3 dated August 2, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of combined operations give effect to the following transactions as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the following transactions as if such transactions had occurred on September 30, 2007:

The Organon BioSciences acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") in the U.S. Under this method, the purchase price and transaction related costs will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) will be allocated to goodwill.
 
 
 
 
In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation, has made estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities based upon assumptions that believes are reasonable. The allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. process for estimating the fair values of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates.

The allocation of purchase price is subject to finalization of analysis of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the final allocation of pension assets as of the Acquisition Date. The final allocation of the purchase price will result in additional adjustments to the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and will also result in adjustments to depreciation, amortization and in-process research and development. The adjustments arising out of the finalization of the purchase price allocation will not impact cash flows. However, such adjustments could result in material increases or decreases to net income available to common shareholders. Further revisions to the purchase price allocation will be made as additional information becomes available. The finalization of the purchase price allocation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after the Acquisition Date.

On November 19, 2007, completed its acquisition of Organon BioSciences for approximately 11.00 billion in cash.

The Organon BioSciences acquisition will be accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the purchase price and transaction related costs are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) is allocated to goodwill.
 
This allocation of the purchase price is subject to finalization of analysis of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the final allocation of pension assets as of the Organon BioSciences Acquisition Date. The final allocation of the purchase price will result in additional adjustments to the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and will also result in adjustments to depreciation, amortization and in-process research and development. The adjustments arising out of the finalization of the purchase price allocation will not impact cash flows. However, such adjustments could result in material increases or decreases to net income available to common shareholders. Further revisions to the purchase price allocation will be made as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the purchase price allocation in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements is preliminary and will be adjusted upon completion of the final valuation. The finalization of the purchase price allocation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after the Acquisition Date.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the Organon BioSciences acquisition and related financing as if it had occurred on September 30, 2007. The historical unaudited condensed combined balance sheet for Organon BioSciences at September 30, 2007, prepared in accordance with IFRS in Euro, has been converted to U.S. GAAP and has been translated to U.S. Dollars using a rate of $1.42, which approximates the Euro conversion rate to U.S. Dollars at September 30, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed statement of combined operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, gives effect to the Organon BioSciences acquisition and related financing as if it had occurred on January 1, 2006. The historical combined statement of income for Organon BioSciences for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, prepared in accordance with IFRS in Euro, have been converted to U.S. GAAP and have been translated to U.S. Dollars using exchange rates of $1.34 and $1.25, respectively, which approximates the average Euro conversion rate to U.S. Dollars for the applicable period.
