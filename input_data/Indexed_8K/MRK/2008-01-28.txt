EXPLANATORY NOTE
Schering-Plough is filing an amendment to its 8-K filed earlier today to correct two typographical errors in Exhibit 99.1. The second Q&A on page 2 of Exhibit 99.1 stated that shares were retained to the company instead of by the company, and the third Q&A on page 2 incorrectly stated that the date the blackout was instituted was December 21, 2008 instead of December 21, 2007. The January 25, 2008 Investor Frequently Asked Questions and Answers have been corrected and furnished in their entirety.
Schering-Plough Corporation from time to time issues Investor Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (FAQs) that are believed to be of interest to investors.
