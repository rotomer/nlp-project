Exhibit 3.2
     The corporate seal shall be two concentric circles having written between them the name of the Corporation and having in their center the words, "Incorporated 1970 New Jersey." Such seal may be an impression or a drawing thereof.
     1. Place of Meetings. Meetings of the shareholders may be held at such place as shall from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors").
     2. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held on such date as from time to time may be established by the Board of Directors.
          (a) . At any annual meeting of shareholders, only such business as shall be set forth in the notice of the annual meeting shall be conducted. Matters to be included in the notice of the annual meeting shall be determined by the Board of Directors.
Business to be conducted at an Annual Meeting
          (b) . A shareholder of the Corporation wishing to include a matter in the notice of meeting for an annual meeting may do so by complying with this Section 2(b). For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Corporate Secretary and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the Board of Directors sets as a
Presentation of matters at request of a shareholder
 
date for the annual meeting a date which is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation if such announcement is made less than 99 days prior to the date of the annual meeting as so announced. The public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting shall not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to any business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made (i) the name and address of such shareholder as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner. A matter submitted by a shareholder for inclusion in the notice of an annual meeting shall not be included if the Board of Directors, or the Chairman of the Board of Directors if so authorized by the Board of Directors, with the advice of counsel determines that the subject is not a proper matter for consideration by the shareholders.
          (c) . No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2 and as otherwise may be required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The provision of Section 2(b) shall not be applicable to any shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts so warrant, declare to the annual meeting that proposed business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2 or otherwise, and declare to the annual meeting that such business shall not be transacted.
Agenda of Annual Meeting
     3. Notice. Written notice of the time, place and purpose or purposes of every meeting of shareholders shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
     4. Record Date. For the purpose of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for such determination of shareholders. Such date shall be not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of such meeting.
     5. Quorum. At any meeting of shareholders, the holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the votes shall constitute a quorum.
     6. Special Meetings. Except as otherwise provided in the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, a special meeting of shareholders may be called only by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the Board of Directors. At any special meeting of shareholders, only such business as shall be set forth in the notice of the meeting shall be conducted.
 
     Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Shares then outstanding, any action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such shareholders unless all of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon consent thereto in writing. This By-Law may be amended, supplemented or repealed by the affirmative vote, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
     1. Election of Directors
          (a) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors which shall have and may exercise all of the powers of the Corporation, except such as are expressly conferred upon the shareholders by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these By-laws. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Shares then outstanding to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the Board of Directors shall consist of not less than nine (9) nor more than twenty-one (21) persons. The exact number of directors within the minimum and maximum limitations specified in the preceding sentence shall be fixed from time to time by either (i) the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, or (ii) the shareholders, by the affirmative vote, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Number, Election and Terms.
     Directors will be elected for annual terms, as provided in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
          (b) In an uncontested election where the number of director nominees is equal to the number of directors to be elected, director nominees who receive votes to withhold, at a meeting in which a quorum is present, by the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast for the election of directors, shall promptly offer his or her written resignation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, excluding the nominee in question, will recommend that the Board accept the resignation absent a compelling reason for the director to remain on the Board. In determining whether there is a compelling reason for the director to remain on the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant
Majority Vote Resignation Policy for Directors.
 
such as the stated reasons why shareholders "withheld" votes for election from such director (and whether the issue has been cured), the qualifications of the director whose resignation has been tendered, compliance with exchange listing standards for board composition regarding independence and financial expertise qualifications, and these By-laws. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation on the earlier of thirty days or its next regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board's explanation of its decision shall be promptly disclosed on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     In a contested election where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the above majority voting resignation policy will not apply, and therefore the Board of Directors shall thereafter consist of those nominees who shall have received a plurality of the votes cast in such election.
     2. Removal. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Shares then outstanding, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time only for cause and only by the affirmative vote, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
     3. Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Shares then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors and any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
     4. The number of directors as fixed in accordance with Section 1 of this Article V, without reduction for vacancies from time to time existing, is referred to herein as the "entire Board of Directors." The Board of Directors may decrease the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors, but not below nine, so as to eliminate any vacancies.
     5. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such places and times as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.
     6. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and shall be called on the written request of at least one-third of the total number of directors then in office. Notice of any special meeting of directors, or any postponement or relocation thereof, shall be given to each director at the director's business, residence, or alternate address, as directed from time to time by the director, in writing by hand delivery, first-class or overnight mail or courier service, telegram or facsimile transmission, orally by telephone, or if approved in advance by the director, by email. If mailed by first-class mail, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered when deposited in the United States mails so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid, at least five days before such meeting. If by telegram, overnight mail or courier service, such notice shall be deemed
 
adequately delivered when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company or the notice is delivered to the overnight mail or courier service company at least 24 hours before such meeting. If by facsimile transmission or email, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered when the notice is transmitted at least 12 hours before such meeting. If by telephone or by hand delivery, the notice shall be given at least 12 hours prior to the time set for the meeting. A meeting may be held at any time without notice if all the directors are present or if those not present waive notice of the meeting. Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the directors who have so requested a meeting, may postpone or relocate any meeting of the Board of Directors with advance notice as set forth herein.
     7. Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings wherever the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.
     8. Quorum and Vote. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, the presence of a majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except as otherwise provided in these By-laws or as otherwise provided by statute, the vote of a majority of the directors present at the time of the vote, if a quorum is present at such time, shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
     9. Executive Committee and Other Committees.
          (a) . The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, may appoint from among its members an Executive Committee and other committees, each consisting of one or more members and alternates, all of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the entire Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer, by reason of such office, shall be a voting member of the Executive Committee. The Board of Directors may by resolution appoint one member as the Chairman of the Executive Committee and such member, when present, shall preside at all meetings of such committee. In the absence of the Chairman of the Executive Committee, the Chief Executive Officer, if present, shall preside at all such meetings. In the absence of the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, a majority of the members of the Executive Committee present shall choose a chairman to preside at such meetings.
Creation of executive and other committees
          (b) . To the extent permitted by law, the Executive Committee may exercise all the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of specified matters where such authority is delegated to it by the Board of Directors, and also, to the extent permitted by law, during the intervals between the meetings of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee shall have, and may exercise, all the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation (including the exercise of the power to authorize the use of the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to papers which may require it, in such manner as the Executive Committee shall deem to be in the best interests of the Corporation and not inconsistent with any prior specific action of the Board of
Authority of committees

Neither the Executive Committee nor any other committee shall have the authority to make, alter, or repeal any by-law of the Corporation, elect or appoint any director, remove any director or officer, submit to shareholders any action that requires shareholder approval, or amend or repeal any resolution adopted by the Board of Directors which by its terms may be amended or repealed only by the Board of Directors.
