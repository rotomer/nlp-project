DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information in the frequently asked questions included in this FAQ, and in other written and oral statements about Schering-Plough and its business made by Schering-Plough or its officers from time to time, includes certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to prescription trends for VYTORIN and ZETIA.
Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. Schering-Plough does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from Schering-Plough's forward-looking statements, including market forces (such as customer buying patterns); economic factors; product availability; patent and other intellectual property protection; current and future branded, generic or over-the-counter competition; the timing and outcomes of the regulatory process; and prescriber, patient and media reaction to data obtained from post-marketing clinical trials, among other uncertainties. For further details about these and other factors that may impact the forward-looking statements, see Schering-Plough's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Schering-Plough's 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2008, filed August 1, 2008.
