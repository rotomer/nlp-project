Exhibit 99.1
SCHERING-PLOUGH REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2009 SECOND QUARTER
Diversification Strategy and Strong Execution Continue to Drive Solid Performance; Robust Pipeline Continues To Advance and Build Long-Term Value
KENILWORTH, N.J., July 21, 2009  Schering-Plough Corporation (NYSE: SGP) today reported financial results for the 2009 second quarter.
          "Our successful diversification strategy and strong execution by our people have given us the strength to again power through tough challenges  delivering operational sales growth and reconciled earnings-per-share growth for the second quarter," said Fred Hassan, chairman and CEO.
          "Meantime, we can see that six years of focus and investment in our R&D pipeline have created enormous long-term value," said Hassan. "Our rich late-stage pipeline continues to advance. We continue to achieve positive regulatory actions in major markets  for example, the recent approval of two products  ASMANEX and REMERON  on the same day in Japan, and a recommendation for approval in Europe of SIMPONI, a novel biologic treatment for inflammatory diseases. In our industry, long-term strength comes from creating a continuous flow of new innovations. We are proud that we have created such a strong and productive R&D engine at Schering-Plough."
          For the 2009 second quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $633 million or 38 cents per common share on a GAAP basis. Earnings per common share for the 2009 second quarter would have been 46 cents on net income of $769 million on a reconciled basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Organon BioSciences (OBS) and special, merger- and acquisition-related items. For the 2008 second quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $424 million or 26 cents per common share on a GAAP basis and earnings of 45 cents per common share on a reconciled basis.
          GAAP net sales for the 2009 second quarter totaled $4.6 billion, down 6 percent as compared to the second quarter of 2008, reflecting operational growth of 4 percent and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 10 percent during the quarter.
 
          Net sales of the cholesterol joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc., which include VYTORIN and ZETIA, totaled $1.0 billion in the 2009 second quarter. Schering-Plough does not record sales of its cholesterol joint venture with Merck as the venture is accounted for under the equity method. Including an adjustment of an assumed 50 percent of the global cholesterol joint venture net sales, Schering-Plough's adjusted net sales for the 2009 second quarter would have been $5.2 billion.
          "Our diverse product strength  from REMICADE to TEMODAR to NUVARING to MIRALAX  and our rich geographic diversity helped drive our operational growth. In fact, we grew sales in most regions around the world on an operational basis. Achieving operational growth on such a broad front in the midst of a severe global recession is no small feat," said Hassan.
          Regarding the company's R&D strength, the company highlighted its strong R&D engine and steady product flow as a special asset at a time when R&D innovation in the industry is so critical. The company noted that the "Five Stars" in its product pipeline, highlighted at its November 2008 R&D update meeting, continued to advance: thrombin receptor antagonist (TRA), in Phase III for atherothrombosis; SIMPONI (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases; SAPHRIS (asenapine), for the acute treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; boceprevir, a protease inhibitor in Phase III for hepatitis C; and BRIDION (sugammadex), an innovative agent for use in anesthesiology.
          The company's R&D engine has produced a number of recent regulatory and pipeline advances, including:
          Regarding the planned merger with Merck announced on March 9, 2009, the company noted that pre-integration planning teams at both Schering-Plough and Merck have been meeting
 
collaboratively to plan for a smooth and effective integration. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009. Until the merger closes, both companies will continue to operate independently.
Second Quarter 2009 Results
For the 2009 second quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $633 million or 38 cents per common share on a GAAP basis. Earnings per common share for the 2009 second quarter would have been 46 cents on net income of $769 million on a reconciled basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the OBS acquisition and special, merger- and acquisition-related items. For the 2008 second quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $424 million or 26 cents per common share on a GAAP basis and earnings of 45 cents per common share on a reconciled basis.
          GAAP net sales for the 2009 second quarter totaled $4.6 billion, down 6 percent as compared to the second quarter of 2008, reflecting operational growth of 4 percent and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 10 percent during the quarter.
          Net sales of the cholesterol franchise, which include sales of the cholesterol joint venture plus sales recorded by Schering-Plough in non-joint venture territories (such as Japan and Latin America), declined 8 percent in the second quarter of 2009 to $1.1 billion, reflecting a 2 percent operational decrease and a 6 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales declined 10 percent in the U.S. In international markets, sales declined 4 percent, reflecting operational growth of 10 percent and a 14 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ZETIA in Japan, sold under a co-marketing agreement with Bayer, contributed $41 million to cholesterol franchise sales in the 2009 period.
          Sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals for the 2009 second quarter decreased 3 percent to $3.6 billion, reflecting 7 percent operational growth and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 10 percent.
          Sales of REMICADE increased 2 percent (19 percent operational growth offset by 17 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $565 million in the second quarter of 2009 due to continued market growth. REMICADE is a treatment for inflammatory diseases that Schering-Plough markets in countries outside the U.S. (except in Japan and certain other Asian markets) for rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
          Global sales of NASONEX, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for allergies, increased 3 percent to $321 million in the 2009 second quarter (10 percent operational growth offset by 7 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) as compared to $311 million in the second quarter of 2008. Operational sales were strong in both the U.S. and internationally as compared to the 2008 period.
 
          Sales of TEMODAR, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 2 percent (11 percent operational growth offset by 9 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $256 million, with higher sales in the U.S. and Japan.
          Sales of PEGINTRON for hepatitis C decreased 6 percent to $215 million in the 2009 second quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 6 percent.
          In women's health care, sales of FOLLISTIM/PUREGON, a fertility treatment, for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 11 percent (1 percent operational decrease and 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $145 million as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Sales of NUVARING, a contraceptive product, in the second quarter of 2009 increased 11 percent (19 percent operational growth offset by 8 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $129 million as compared to $116 million in the second quarter of 2008.
          Global sales of CLARINEX, a nonsedating antihistamine, were $226 million, a decrease of 6 percent (4 percent operational growth offset by 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) as compared to the second quarter of 2008.
          Sales of CLARITIN in the prescription business were $96 million, a 13 percent decrease (6 percent operational decrease and 7 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) compared to sales of $111 million in the second quarter of 2008.
          Animal Health sales totaled $677 million in the 2009 second quarter, a 17 percent decrease as compared to $818 million in the second quarter of 2008 (7 percent operational decrease and 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact). The sales decline was a result of the overall economic environment, difficult comparisons against the 2008 launch of bluetongue vaccine and the impact of 2008 product divestitures.
          Consumer Health Care sales were $381 million in the 2009 second quarter, down 5 percent versus the 2008 period. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of sun care products, which primarily reflected the impact of unseasonable weather conditions in many parts of the U.S. Higher sales of MIRALAX helped offset lower sales of OTC CLARITIN.
          Schering-Plough does not record sales of its cholesterol joint venture and incurs substantial costs such as selling, general and administrative costs that are not reflected in "Equity income" and are borne by the overall cost structure of Schering-Plough. As a result, Schering-Plough's gross margin and ratios of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the cholesterol joint venture's operating results.
          Schering-Plough's gross margin on a GAAP basis was unfavorably affected by purchase accounting adjustments and totaled 65.1 percent for the 2009 second quarter as compared to 61.2 percent in the 2008 period. On a reconciled basis, the gross margin percentage decreased to 68.1 percent for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to 68.4 percent for the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
 
          SG&A expenses were $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 13 percent decrease versus the second quarter of 2008 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and the company's Productivity Transformation Program (PTP).
          Research and development spending for the 2009 second quarter totaled $863 million, a 5 percent decrease, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange.

SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION
Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted net sales, defined as Net sales plus an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales.
 
a/      Total Net sales of the cholesterol joint venture for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Total Net sales of the cholesterol joint venture for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.
NOTE: Adjusted net sales, defined as net sales plus an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales, is a non-U.S. GAAP measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the Schering-Plough's overall business. Schering-Plough believes that this performance measure contributes to a more complete understanding by investors of the overall results of the company. Schering-Plough provides this information to supplement the reader's understanding of the importance to the company of its share of results from the operations of the cholesterol joint venture. Net sales (excluding the cholesterol joint venture net sales) is required to be presented under U.S. GAAP. The cholesterol joint venture's net sales are included as a component of income from operations in the calculation of Schering-Plough's "Equity income." Net sales of the cholesterol joint venture do not include net sales of cholesterol products in non-joint venture territories.

The results of the operation of the joint venture are reflected in Equity income. As a result, Schering-Plough's Gross margin and ratios of Selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the cholesterol joint venture's operating results.
Schering-Plough utilizes the equity method of accounting in recording its share of activity from the Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol joint venture. Schering-Plough's Net sales do not include the sales of the joint venture. The cholesterol joint venture agreements provide for the sharing of operating income generated by the joint venture based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. Equity income also includes milestone and other payments. Either company's share of the joint venture's income from operations is subject to a reduction if that company fails to perform a specified minimum number of physician details in a particular country. The companies agree annually to the minimum number of physician details by country.
In the U.S. market, Schering-Plough receives a greater share of profits on the first $300 million of annual ZETIA sales. As such, Schering-Plough's share of operating income from the joint venture in the first fiscal quarter is generally higher than subsequent quarters.
