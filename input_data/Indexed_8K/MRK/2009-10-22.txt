SCHERING-PLOUGH REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2009 THIRD QUARTER
Focus and Execution on Core Strategies Drive Solid Performance; 3 of 5 Stars' in Product Pipeline Launched in Major Markets
KENILWORTH, N.J., Oct. 22, 2009  Schering-Plough Corporation (NYSE: SGP) today reported financial results for the 2009 third quarter.
          "This quarter we delivered operational top-line growth, reconciled bottom-line growth and major pipeline successes. We powered through  even in the face of tough global economic and currency headwinds," said Fred Hassan, chairman and CEO "As we near the anticipated close of our combination with Merck, we are proud of how our colleagues continue to drive Schering-Plough's strong performance."
          He added, "Our people are focused and executing well on our core strategies. We continue to improve efficiencies and reduce costs through our Productivity Transformation Program (PTP). And, importantly, we are delivering our robust product pipeline."
          Hassan pointed to several recent examples:
          For the 2009 third quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $477 million or 29 cents per common share on a GAAP basis. Earnings per common share for the 2009 third quarter would have been 40 cents on net income of $670 million on a reconciled basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the 2007 acquisition of Organon BioSciences NV (OBS) and special, merger- and acquisition-related items. For the 2008 third quarter,
 
Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $576 million or 35 cents per common share on a GAAP basis and earnings of 39 cents per common share on a reconciled basis. GAAP earnings in the 2008 period benefited from a $160 million pre-tax gain on divestitures of certain animal health products related to the OBS acquisition.
          GAAP net sales for the 2009 third quarter totaled $4.5 billion, down 2 percent as compared to the third quarter of 2008, reflecting operational growth of 4 percent and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 6 percent during the quarter.
          "Our prescription pharmaceutical business performed particularly well in this past quarter," said Hassan. Six of the company's 10 largest-selling prescription products posted higher sales, even with the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. "Now, six years into our Action Agenda, we have transformed our entire company while building a powerful R&D engine," he added.
          At Schering-Plough's R&D Update meeting in November 2008, the company highlighted "Five Stars" in its late-stage pipeline: a thrombin receptor antagonist (TRA), in Phase III for atherothrombosis; SIMPONI; SAPHRIS; boceprevir, a protease inhibitor in Phase III for hepatitis C; and BRIDION (sugammadex), an innovative agent for use in anesthesiology. With the recent approvals of SIMPONI and SAPHRIS, three of those Five Stars  SIMPONI, SAPHRIS and BRIDION  have been launched in major markets.
          Since the November 2008 meeting, the company has submitted regulatory filings for three new entities: corifollitropin alfa, a sustained follicle stimulant for controlled ovarian stimulation, filed in the EU; mometasone furoate/formoterol, a combination asthma therapy, filed in the U.S. and EU; and nomegestrol acetate/17-estradiol, a combined oral contraceptive, filed in the EU.
b
          Regarding the planned merger with Merck announced on March 9, 2009, the company noted that pre-integration planning teams at both Schering-Plough and Merck have been meeting collaboratively to plan for a smooth and effective integration. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009. Until the merger closes, both companies will continue to operate independently.
Third Quarter 2009 Results
For the 2009 third quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $477 million or 29 cents per common share on a GAAP basis. Earnings per common share for the 2009 third quarter would have been 40 cents on net income of $670 million on a reconciled basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the OBS acquisition and special, merger- and acquisition-related items. For the 2008 third quarter, Schering-Plough reported net income available to common shareholders of $576 million or 35 cents per common share on a GAAP basis and earnings of 39 cents per common share on a reconciled basis. GAAP earnings in the 2008 period benefited from a $160 million pre-tax gain on divestitures of certain animal health products related to the OBS acquisition.
 
          GAAP net sales for the 2009 third quarter totaled $4.5 billion, down 2 percent as compared to the third quarter of 2008, reflecting operational growth of 4 percent and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 6 percent during the quarter.
          Net sales of the cholesterol franchise, which include sales of the cholesterol joint venture plus sales recorded by Schering-Plough in non-joint venture territories (such as Japan and Latin America), declined 5 percent in the third quarter of 2009 to $1.1 billion, reflecting a 2 percent operational decrease and a 3 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales declined 10 percent in the U.S. In international markets, sales increased 3 percent, reflecting operational growth of 10 percent and a 7 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ZETIA in Japan, sold under a co-marketing agreement with Bayer, contributed $47 million to cholesterol franchise sales in the 2009 period.
          Sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals for the 2009 third quarter totaled $3.5 billion, reflecting operational growth of 6 percent offset by a 6 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
          Sales of REMICADE increased 8 percent (18 percent operational growth offset by 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $608 million in the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to continued market growth. REMICADE is a treatment for inflammatory diseases that Schering-Plough markets in countries outside the U.S. (except in Japan and certain other Asian markets) for rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, SIMPONI, a once-monthly, subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases, has been launched in Canada and Germany; launches in other international markets are ongoing or planned.
          Sales of TEMODAR, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 2 percent (7 percent operational growth offset by 5 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $278 million, with higher sales in all regions, excluding foreign exchange.
          Global sales of NASONEX, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for allergies, increased 3 percent to $266 million in the 2009 third quarter (7 percent operational growth offset by 4 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) as compared to $258 million in the third quarter of 2008. Operational sales increased in both the U.S. and internationally as compared to the 2008 period.
          Sales of PEGINTRON for hepatitis C decreased 16 percent to $198 million in the 2009 third quarter (14 percent operational decrease and 2 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact), with lower sales in both the U.S. and internationally.
          In women's health care, sales of NUVARING, a contraceptive product, in the third quarter of 2009 increased 11 percent (15 percent operational growth offset by 4 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $131 million as compared to $118 million in the third quarter of 2008, with higher sales in all regions when excluding foreign exchange. Sales of FOLLISTIM/PUREGON, a fertility treatment, decreased 14 percent (10 percent operational decrease and 4 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) to $122 million as compared to the third quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting lower demand for fertility treatments.
 
          Global sales of CLARINEX, a nonsedating antihistamine, were $164 million, a decrease of 7 percent (1 percent operational decrease and 6 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) as compared to the third quarter of 2008.
          Sales of CLARITIN in the prescription business were $95 million, a 9 percent increase (13 percent operational growth offset by 4 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact) compared to sales of $87 million in the third quarter of 2008.
          Animal Health sales totaled $669 million in the 2009 third quarter, a 12 percent decrease as compared to $759 million in the third quarter of 2008 (5 percent operational decrease and 7 percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact). The sales decline was primarily due to the overall economic environment, difficult comparisons against the 2008 launch of bluetongue vaccine as well as back orders on certain products due primarily to the ongoing integration of Animal Health manufacturing practices and quality standards.
          Consumer Health Care sales were $282 million in the 2009 third quarter, roughly in line with the 2008 period. Higher sales of MIRALAX and other OTC products were offset by lower sales of OTC CLARITIN, sun care and foot care products.
          Schering-Plough does not record sales of its cholesterol joint venture and incurs substantial costs such as selling, general and administrative costs that are not reflected in "Equity income" and are borne by the overall cost structure of Schering-Plough. As a result, Schering-Plough's gross margin and ratios of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the cholesterol joint venture's operating results.
          Schering-Plough's gross margin on a GAAP basis was unfavorably affected by purchase accounting adjustments and special items, and totaled 61.8 percent for the 2009 third quarter as compared to 62.0 percent in the 2008 period. On a reconciled basis, the gross margin percentage decreased to 65.9 percent for the third quarter of 2009 as compared to 66.9 percent for the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by favorable product mix and manufacturing cost savings.
          SG&A expenses were $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2009, a 9 percent decrease versus the third quarter of 2008 (5 percent operational decrease and 4 percent favorable foreign exchange impact) primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and the company's Productivity Transformation Program.
          Research and development spending for the 2009 third quarter totaled $913 million, a 2 percent increase (4 percent operational increase and 2 percent favorable foreign exchange impact), related to higher spending for clinical trials and related activities, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.

     Adjusted net sales, defined as Net sales plus an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales.
 
NOTE: Adjusted net sales, defined as net sales plus an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales, is a non-U.S. GAAP measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the Schering-Plough's overall business. Schering-Plough believes that this performance measure contributes to a more complete understanding by investors of the overall results of the company. Schering-Plough provides this information to supplement the reader's understanding of the importance to the company of its share of results from the operations of the cholesterol joint venture. Net sales (excluding the cholesterol joint venture net sales) is required to be presented under U.S. GAAP. The cholesterol joint venture's net sales are included as a component of income from operations in the calculation of Schering-Plough's "Equity income." Net sales of the cholesterol joint venture do not include net sales of cholesterol products in non-joint venture territories.

The results of the operation of the joint venture are reflected in Equity income. As a result, Schering-Plough's Gross margin and ratios of Selling, general and administrative expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the cholesterol joint venture's operating results.
Schering-Plough utilizes the equity method of accounting in recording its share of activity from the Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol joint venture. Schering-Plough's Net sales do not include the sales of the joint venture. The cholesterol joint venture agreements provide for the sharing of operating income generated by the joint venture based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. Equity income also includes milestone and other payments. Either company's share of the joint venture's income from operations is subject to a reduction if that company fails to perform a specified minimum number of physician details in a particular country. The companies agree annually to the minimum number of physician details by country.
In the U.S. market, Schering-Plough receives a greater share of profits on the first $300 million of annual ZETIA sales. As such, Schering-Plough's share of operating income from the joint venture in the first fiscal quarter is generally higher than subsequent quarters.
