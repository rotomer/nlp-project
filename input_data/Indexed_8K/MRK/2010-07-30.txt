Second-Quarter Financial Results
The following supplemental combined second-quarter 2009 non-GAAP sales are adjusted to reflect a full quarter of legacy Merck and legacy Schering-Plough combined results. This supplemental information is provided to enhance investors' understanding of the company's products and overall business performance and should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, sales recorded in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
The company's financial performance for the second quarter of 2010 discussed below reflects the combined company results. The increases noted are largely due to the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough operations which are not included in the 2009 results.
Materials and production costs were $4.5 billion for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2009. The second quarter of 2010 includes $1.7 billion of additional costs related to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to inventories and to intangible assets recognized as a result of the merger. The second quarters of 2010 and 2009 include $224 million and $47 million, respectively, for costs associated with restructuring programs. The gross margin was 59.9 percent for the second quarter of 2010, reflecting a 16.6 percentage point unfavorable impact from the purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring costs noted above. In 2009, gross margin was 77.1 percent for the second quarter, reflecting a 0.8 percentage point unfavorable impact due to restructuring costs.
Marketing and administrative expenses were $3.2 billion for the second quarter of 2010. Costs for the second quarter include $75 million of merger-related costs. Marketing and administrative costs were $1.7 billion for the second quarter of 2009. Costs for the second quarter of 2009 include $44 million of merger-related expenses.
Research and development expenses were $2.2 billion for the second quarter of 2010, which included $144 million of costs for restructuring activities. Expenses for 2009 were $1.4 billion for the quarter which included $108 million of costs for restructuring activities.
Restructuring costs, primarily related to employee separations, were $526 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared with $37 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase for the second quarter of 2010 is associated with the merger restructuring program.
Total overall costs associated with the company's global restructuring programs included in materials and production, research and development, and restructuring costs were $894 million and $192 million for the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily comprised of employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation.
Equity income from affiliates was $43 million in the second quarter of 2010. Equity income from affiliates no longer reflects any contribution from the Merck/Schering-Plough partnership or from Merial Limited.
Other (income) expense, net was $280 million of income in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $4 million of expense in the second quarter of 2009 largely reflecting $443 million of income recognized in the second quarter of 2010 upon AstraZeneca's asset option exercise, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income as a result of the merger.
 
The effective tax rate of 37.1 percent for the second quarter of 2010 reflects the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, the gain on AstraZeneca's asset option exercise and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes these items, was 20.5 percent for the quarter.
Financial Targets
For 2010, Merck is now targeting a non-GAAP EPS range of $3.29 to $3.39, excluding certain items, and a 2010 GAAP EPS range of $0.82 to $1.16. The 2010 non-GAAP guidance excludes purchase accounting adjustments, restructuring and merger-related costs, the gain on AstraZeneca's asset option exercise, and the first-quarter tax charge related to the recently enacted U.S. health care reform legislation. EPS and other financial targets for 2010 assume that Merck will retain full rights to REMICADE and SIMPONI in the applicable markets.
A reconciliation of anticipated 2010 EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP EPS that excludes certain items is provided in the table that follows:
 
 
 
 
Merck said it now expects full-year 2010 revenue to be between $45.4 billion and $46.1 billion, including the impact of the recently passed health care reform legislation. For the full year 2010, the increased Medicaid rebates (including Managed Medicaid) and other impacts are expected to reduce revenue by approximately $170 million, which includes a second-quarter 2010 impact of approximately $44 million and $76 million for the first half of 2010.
Non-GAAP research and development expense, which excludes joint ventures, is now anticipated to be approximately $8.2 billion to $8.6 billion for the full year of 2010. This guidance excludes the portion of the restructuring costs and any in-process R&D impairment charges included in research and development expense for 2010.
Merck continues to estimate that its consolidated non-GAAP 2010 tax rate will be approximately 22 percent to 24 percent.
Merck continues to target a high single-digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate for the combined company from 2009 to 2013 when compared to Merck 2009 non-GAAP EPS. As the company has previously said, the longer-term targets are applicable regardless of the assumptions made for the REMICADE and SIMPONI business.
Product Performance
The sales figures discussed below for legacy Schering-Plough products are reported on a GAAP basis, which represents sales for the second quarter of 2010 only.
Bone, Respiratory, Immunology and Dermatology
Worldwide sales of SINGULAIR (montelukast sodium), a once-a-day oral medicine indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, were $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2010, comparable with the second quarter of 2009.
Global sales of NASONEX (mometasone furoate monohydrate), nasal spray, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, were $338 million for the second quarter of 2010.
Sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were $669 million for the second quarter of 2010. REMICADE is a treatment for inflammatory diseases which is marketed by Merck in countries outside the United States (except in Japan and certain other Asian markets). In addition, SIMPONI (golimumab), a once-monthly, subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases, has been launched in ten countries including Canada, Germany, and recently in Spain; launches in other international markets are planned.
 
Cardiovascular
Global sales of ZETIA (ezetimibe) and VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) were $564 million and $490 million, respectively, for the second quarter of 2010. Combined global sales of ZETIA and VYTORIN were $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2010.
Diabetes and Obesity
JANUVIA (sitagliptin), Merck's DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recorded worldwide sales of $600 million during the second quarter of 2010, representing a 30 percent increase compared with same quarter in 2009. JANUMET (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride), a single tablet that targets all three key defects of type 2 diabetes, achieved worldwide sales of $218 million during the quarter, an increase of 41 percent compared with the second quarter 2009. The JANUVIA/JANUMET combined franchise had sales of $818 million during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 33 percent compared to the same quarter in 2009.
Infectious Disease
ISENTRESS (raltegravir), an HIV integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, reported worldwide sales of $267 million for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 55 percent compared with the second quarter of 2009.
Worldwide sales of PEGINTRON (peginterferon alfa-2b) for chronic hepatitis C were $185 million for the second quarter of 2010.
Mature Brands
Merck's mature brands are human health pharmaceutical products that are approaching the expiration of their marketing exclusivity or are no longer protected by patents in developed markets, but continue to be a core part of the company's offering in other markets around the world.
Global sales of Merck's antihypertensive medicines, COZAAR (losartan potassium) and HYZAAR
7
(losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide), were $485 million for the second quarter of 2010, representing a 46 percent decrease compared with the second quarter of 2009. The company is experiencing a significant decline in COZAAR/HYZAAR sales since these medicines have lost marketing exclusivity in the United States and in major European markets.
 
 
Neuroscience and Ophthalmology
Global sales of MAXALT (rizatriptan benzoate), Merck's tablet for the treatment of acute migraine, were $133 million for the second quarter of 2010, a 5 percent decrease from the same quarter last year.

Worldwide sales of Merck's other viral vaccines, which include VARIVAX (varicella virus vaccine live), M-M-R II (measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccine live) and PROQUAD (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella virus vaccine live), as recorded by Merck, were $340 million for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 5 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.
ZOSTAVAX (zoster vaccine live), the company's vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster), recorded sales of $18 million in the United States for the second quarter of 2010 compared with $42 million for the second quarter of 2009. Customers will experience backorders, or periods where they are unable to place orders, for ZOSTAVAX throughout 2010 and possibly into 2011. Due to supply constraints, no international launches or immunization programs are currently planned for this year or 2011.

Sales of FOLLISTIM/PUREGON (follitropin beta injection), a fertility treatment, were $137 million for the second quarter of 2010.
