Forward-Looking Statements:
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K (including information included or incorporated by reference therein) includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed arrangements under the Second Amendment Agreement, including future financial and operating results, the plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.  Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Mercks and Schering-Ploughs management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
 
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the possibility that the transactions contemplated by the Second Amendment Agreement will not be realized within the expected time period, due to, among other things, the inability to obtain governmental and other consents and approvals of the arrangements contemplated by the Second Amendment Agreement on the proposed terms and schedule; and disruption from the arrangements contemplated by the Second Amendment Agreement making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships.  Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Mercks 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Mercks other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) available at the SECs Internet site (www.sec.gov).

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
News Release
and NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 15, 2011  Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and its subsidiary Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc., today announced that the companies have reached agreement to amend the distribution rights to REMICADE (infliximab) and SIMPONI (golimumab), which treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This agreement concludes the arbitration proceeding Johnson & Johnson initiated in May 2009, requesting a ruling related to the distribution agreement following the announcement of the proposed merger between Merck and Schering-Plough.
WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J.,
 
Under the terms of the amended distribution agreement, Merck's subsidiary, Schering-Plough (Ireland) will relinquish exclusive marketing rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI to Johnson & Johnsons Janssen pharmaceutical companies in territories including Canada, Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific* (relinquished territories), effective July 1, 2011.  Merck will retain exclusive marketing rights throughout Europe, Russia and Turkey (retained territories). The retained territories represent approximately 70 percent of Merck's 2010 revenue of approximately $2.8 billion from REMICADE and SIMPONI, while the relinquished territories represent approximately 30 percent.  In addition, all profit derived from Merck's exclusive distribution of the two products in the retained territories will be equally divided between Merck and Johnson & Johnson, beginning July 1, 2011.  Under the prior terms of the distribution agreement, the contribution income (profit) split, which is currently at 58 percent to Merck and 42 percent to Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc., would have declined for Merck and increased for Johnson & Johnson each year until 2014, when it would have been equally divided.  Johnson & Johnson will also receive a one-time payment of $500 million in April 2011. Merck expects to file the amended agreement on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.
We are pleased to have reached this voluntary agreement and look forward to continuing to serve patients in need with REMICADE and SIMPONI throughout Europe, Russia and Turkey, said Kenneth Frazier, President and Chief Executive Officer of Merck.  The immunology field is a rapidly growing therapeutic area.  Merck will have a strong footprint in this category through our significant retained interests in REMICADE and SIMPONI, both of which will be important contributors to our overall portfolio.  We also are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for customers and patients in the territories being relinquished, with no impact on product supply.
We are pleased to have reached an amended agreement with Merck and expand our market-leading immunology portfolio on a global basis, said Bill Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. These important medicines provide very meaningful benefit to the patients who depend upon them, and our first priority will be to ensure the continued availability of REMICADE and SIMPONI to healthcare providers and patients around the world, while continuing to increase access.  We are working closely with Merck to make certain this is a seamless transition in the relinquished territories.
[ In addition to this announcement, Merck and Johnson & Johnson issued separate news releases providing additional financial information regarding this transaction to their respective companies. A full listing of the territories is included below.]
