The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as
2 representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company and the Guarantor to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriter and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. The Company and the Guarantor, as the case may be, represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (#333-90034 and #333-90034-01) with respect to the Securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; no other document with respect to such registration statement and no other document required to be incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than documents filed prior to the date hereof and documents permitted to be filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in such registration statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), being hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"); the various parts of such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in the registration statement at the time such part of the registration statement became effective but excluding Form T-1, each as amended at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, being hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; if it is contemplated, at the time the Pricing Agreement is executed, that a registration statement or a post-effective amendment will be filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) or Rule 462(d) under the Act, the term "Registration Statement" as used in this Agreement includes such registration statement; the prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this

5 (h) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company and the Guarantor with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated (i) will not result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Guarantor or the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company, (ii) will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or the Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or the Guarantor is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or the Guarantor is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (iii) will not result in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or the Guarantor or any of its properties, except for such violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company or the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery, obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters; and (i) Other than as set forth in the Final Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Guarantor, the Company, or any of their subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Guarantor, the Company, or any of their subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Guarantor, the Company, or any of their subsidiaries, would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others. 3.

The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that each of the Company and the Guarantor shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Final Prospectus in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; (b) Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the incorporation of the Company and the Guarantor, the validity of the Indenture, the Designated Securities, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) The Company shall have requested and caused counsel for the Company and the Guarantor to furnish to the Representatives written opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex IV and Annex V, which opinions must be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives. (d) At the date and time of execution (the "Execution Time") of the Pricing Agreement and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Guarantor who have certified the financial statements of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated such date, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated the date of the Time of Delivery, as to such

(f) On or after the date and time that the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities is executed by the parties thereto (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the Guarantor's securities or securities guaranteed by the Guarantor, including any of the Company's debt securities; (g) On or after the date and time that the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities is executed by the parties thereto there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or The New York Stock Exchange or there shall have been a suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption of securities settlement or clearance services; or (iii) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any similar substantial national or international calamity or emergency, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities; (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantor reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of all of their obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; (i) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Stewart McKelvey Stirling Scales, special Canadian counsel to the Company, in substantially the form of Annex III; and

Notice of such cancelation shall be given to the Company and the Guarantor in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 7 shall be delivered at the time and place specified in the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities. 8. (a) The Company and the Guarantor will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantor will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any such document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein; provided, further, that the foregoing indemnification, to the extent it relates to any actual or alleged untrue statement or omission made in or from any Preliminary Prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the Final Prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting such untrue statement or omission purchased offered Securities if a copy of the Final Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated therein by reference) was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such offered Securities to such person if the Company or the Guarantor has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor and each of their directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages
11 or liabilities to which the Company or the Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or (ii) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist of any Underwriter or any of their respective controlling persons, or by the Company and the Guarantor, if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist of the Company, the Guarantor or any of the Company's or Guarantor's directors, officers or controlling persons. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
12 indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
13 fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability, which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Guarantor to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company and the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company and the Guarantor that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company and the Guarantor notify the Representatives that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company and the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Guarantor agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus which the majority in interest of the Underwriters (including the Representatives) may reasonably determine are thereby necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company and the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
14 (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company and the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancelation of this Agreement. 11. If the sale of the Designated Securities provided for by the Pricing Agreement is not consummated for any reason (other than (1) a breach by any Underwriter of its obligations hereunder, (2) a termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof, or (3) a termination pursuant to the second clause of Section 7(g)(i), Section 7(g)(ii) or Section 7(g)(iii) hereof), the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally, through the Representatives, for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under any further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities, except that the provisions of Sections 6 and 8 hereof shall survive. If the sale of the Designated Securities provided for by the Pricing Agreement is not consummated due to (1) a breach by any Underwriter of its obligations hereunder, (2) a termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or (3) a termination pursuant to the second clause of Section 7(g)(i), Section 7(g)(ii) or Section 7(g)(iii) hereof, the Underwriters will be responsible for all out-of-pocket expenses that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the purchase and sale of the Designated Securities, except that the provisions of Sections 6 and 8 hereof shall survive. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
15 All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company or the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Guarantor at 5555 San Felipe Road, Houston, Texas 77056-2723, or by facsimile to (713) 296-9375: Attention: Corporate Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each person who controls the Company, the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington D.C. is open for business. 15. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011 as its Authorized Agent (the "Authorized Agent") upon whom process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Pricing Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) or the transactions contemplated thereby that may be instituted in any Federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter. 16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

ANNEX III FORM OF CANADIAN OPINION OPINION OF [CANADIAN COUNSEL] PURSUANT TO SECTION 7(i) OF THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT June , 2002 Banc of America Securities LLC 100 North Tryon Street Charlotte, NC 28255 and J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. 270 Park Avenue New York, NY 10017 and As Representatives of the several Underwriters, Cravath, Swaine & Moore Worldwide Plaza 825 Eighth Avenue New York, NY 10019-7475 Dear Sirs: Re: MARATHON GLOBAL FUNDING CORPORATION - ISSUE OF ___% NOTES DUE 20__ We have acted as Canadian counsel to Marathon Global Funding Corporation (the "Company") in connection with the creation, issue and sale by the Company of U.S. $400,000,000 principal amount of ___% notes due 20__ (the "Designated Securities"), as guaranteed by Marathon Oil Corporation (the "Guarantor"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated June , 2002 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company, the Guarantor, and Banc of America
III-2 Securities LLC, for itself and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule __ of the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"). The Designated Securities were issued pursuant to the provisions of an indenture dated as of June , 2002 (the "Indenture") between the Company, the Guarantor, and [ ] as trustee. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to section 7(i) of the Underwriting Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined will have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Underwriting Agreement. As counsel to the Company, we have participated, together with [ ], United States counsel to the Company, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore, United States counsel to the Underwriters, in the preparation of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture. We have also considered such questions of law and examined such statutes, public and corporate records, certificates of governmental authorities and officers of the Company and other documents and conducted such other examinations as we have considered necessary or desirable to enable us to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination we have assumed the legal capacity of all individuals, the veracity of the information contained in the documents, the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, facsimile or photostatic copies of original documents. We are solicitors qualified to practice law in the Province of ______ and, except to the extent that we rely upon the opinions of other counsel as herein set forth, we express no opinion as to any laws or any matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the Province of ______ and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. The phrases "to our knowledge" or "we are not aware of" or similar phrases as used to qualify any opinion herein means the actual knowledge or awareness of those lawyers of our firm who were involved in the offering of the Designated Securities without such lawyers making specific inquiry or investigation for the purpose of this opinion. As to various questions of fact material to our opinion, which we have not verified independently, we have relied upon documents or certificates of governmental authorities and the Company or its officers. In expressing the opinions in paragraphs (a) and (f) we have relied, as to factual matters, exclusively on the officer's certificate provided by an officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), a copy of which is attached, and we believe that we and you may properly rely upon such Officer's Certificate. In expressing the opinion in paragraph (f) with respect to the non-contravention of applicable law, we have assumed that the Designated Securities will not be sold by the Underwriters in Canada and that the Designated Securities will not be sold to purchasers having the intention of re-sale to persons in Canada. On the basis of the foregoing and subject to the qualifications hereinafter expressed, we are of the opinion that:
III-3 (a) the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each Canadian jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole; (b) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (c) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (d) the Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (e) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Designated Securities will not contravene any provisions of the memorandum or articles of incorporation of the Company; (f) to our knowledge, the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Designated Securities will not contravene any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company that has been filed pursuant to and in accordance with the Exchange Act and that is material to the Company taken as a whole, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court of Canada or any jurisdiction therein, or any provision of applicable law and no consent, approval, authorization or order of or qualification with any governmental body or agency is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Designated Securities; (g) a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would give effect to the choice of New York law as the proper law governing the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement provided that such choice of law is bona fide (in the sense that it was not made with a view to avoiding the consequences of the laws of any other jurisdiction) and provided that such choice of law is not contrary to public policy, as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws
III-4 of Canada applicable therein; to our knowledge, there are no reasons under present law for avoiding the choice of New York law to govern the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein; (h) if the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement were sought to be enforced in the Province of Nova Scotia in accordance with the laws applicable thereto, as chosen by the parties, namely, New York law, a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would, subject to paragraph (g) above, and to the extent specifically pleaded and proved as a fact by expert evidence, recognize the choice of New York law and apply such law to all issues that, under the conflict of laws rules of the Province of Nova Scotia, are to be determined in accordance with the proper or general law of a contract, provided that none of the provisions of the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement, or of New York law, are contrary to public policy as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein; and further provided that, in matters of procedure (as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein), the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia will be applied including the [ ] and a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia will retain discretion to decline to hear such action and apply such law (1) if it is contrary to public policy (as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein) for such court to do so, or (ii) if it is not the proper forum to hear such an action, or (iii) if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere; to our knowledge, there are no reasons based on public policy, as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the laws of Canada applicable therein, for avoiding enforcement of the Indenture, the Designated Securities or the Underwriting Agreement (with the exception of the indemnity and contribution provisions contained therein); (i) the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia permit an action to be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia on any final and conclusive judgment in personam for a fixed sum of money of any federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York ("New York Court") respecting the enforcement of the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement that is not impeachable as void or voidable under the internal laws of the State of New York for a sum certain if (i) the court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the judgment debtor, as recognized by the courts of the Province of Nova Scotia (to our knowledge, submission under the provisions of the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement to the jurisdiction of the New York Court will be sufficient for this purpose), and the judgment debtor was properly served in the action leading to such
III-5 judgment; (ii) such judgment was not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice and the enforcement thereof would not be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, or contrary to any order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada); (iii) the enforcement of such judgment does not constitute, directly or indirectly, the enforcement of foreign revenue, expropriation or penal laws or other laws of a public law nature; (iv) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is discovered prior to rendering of judgment by the court in the Province of Nova Scotia; and (v) the action to enforce such judgment is commenced within the applicable limitation periods; to our knowledge, there are no reasons under present law of the Province of Nova Scotia for avoiding recognition of said judgments of New York Courts which might be rendered in respect of the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement based upon public policy, as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein; and (j) in an action on a final and conclusive judgment in personam for a fixed sum of money of a New York Court which is not impeachable as void or voidable under New York law, a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would not refuse to recognize the jurisdiction of the court rendering such judgment on the basis of process having been served on CT Corporation System [WHO IS MARATHON FUNDING'S EQUIVALENT?] as the agent to receive service of process in the United States of America appointed by the Company under the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement provided the Company has not purported to revoke the appointment, or CT Corporation System has not terminated the agency or otherwise rendered service on it ineffective. Our opinion in paragraph (h) relating to the enforceability of the Indenture, the Designated Securities and the Underwriting Agreement, as applicable, and our opinion in paragraphs (i) and (j) relating to a final and conclusive judgment in personam for a fixed sum of money of a New York court are subject to the following limitations and qualifications: (i) enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, limitations of action, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general application now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; (ii) enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity, including the limitation that the grant of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is discretionary and may not be available;

ANNEX IV FORM OF IN-HOUSE COUNSEL'S OPINION [ ] [ ], As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [ ] Ladies and Gentlemen: I am the [ ]of Marathon Oil Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"). I am furnishing this opinion under Section 7(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated [ ] (the "Underwriting Agreement") that is incorporated by reference into the Pricing Agreement dated [ ] (the "Pricing Agreement") by and among Marathon Global Funding Corporation, a Nova Scotia corporation (the "Company"), Marathon Oil Corporation (the "Guarantor") and the several Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of [$___,000,000 aggregate principal amount of [ ] Notes due [ ] and] $___,000,000 aggregate principal amount of [ ] Notes due [ ] (the "Securities"). The Company will issue the Securities under an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of [ ] between it, the Guarantor and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee. The Securities will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by the Guarantor pursuant to the Indenture. The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-90034 and 333-90034-01) relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance therewith and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, of securities of the Company, to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, including the Securities. That registration statement, as amended by post-effective amendment No. 1 thereto, which the Company and the Guarantor filed with the Commission on June 14, 2002, at the time that registration statement became effective, including all documents incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the prospectus dated June 17, 2002, together with the prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2002,each as filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Prospectus." I have, or attorneys under my supervision have, examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of the restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, of the Guarantor, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Underwriting Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, corporate records of the Guarantor, including
IV-2 minute books of the Guarantor, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Guarantor, oral representations of the Guarantor's employees, statutes and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions I hereinafter express. In giving these opinions, I have relied on certificates of representatives of the Guarantor and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters those certificates cover or contain, and I have assumed that all signatures on documents I have examined are genuine, all documents submitted to me as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original copies of those documents and those original copies are authentic. On the basis of the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications I set forth herein, I am of the following opinions: 1. The authorized capital stock of the Guarantor is comprised of 550,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), and 26,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value ("Preferred Stock"). No shares of Preferred Stock have been issued. All the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. 2. Each subsidiary of the Guarantor listed on Annex A hereto (each a "Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Subsidiaries") has been duly incorporated or formed and is validly existing as a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and each Subsidiary has full corporate or other power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus. All the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the Subsidiaries which the Prospectus indicates are owned by the Guarantor, directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, to my knowledge, after due inquiry, free and clear of any perfected security interest and any other material security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance (other than restrictions on transfer contained in the Guarantor's joint venture agreements). 3. I do not know of (a) any pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings involving the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that are required to be disclosed in the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, which are not disclosed in the Prospectus or (b) any franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not described or filed as required. The statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus under the headings "Description of Notes," "Description of Debt Securities," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies," insofar as such statements summarize legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings discussed therein, are accurate and fair summaries of such legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings. 4. The issuance and sale of the Securities, including the Guarantee, the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Pricing Agreement and the compliance by the Guarantor with the terms of the Pricing Agreement will not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of or the imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance on any property or assets of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary under, (i) the terms of any indenture,
IV-3 contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor or any Subsidiary is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, except for any such conflicts, breaches, violations, liens, charges or encumbrances as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) to my knowledge, any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Guarantor or that Subsidiary or any of its properties, except for such conflicts, breaches or violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 5. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than (a) the financial statements (including the notes thereto and the auditor's reports thereon) included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (b) the other accounting, financial, reserve engineering and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not comment), as of the respective dates on which they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. 6. No holders of securities of the Company or the Guarantor have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement. I have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantor, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Guarantor and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although I have not undertaken to determine independently, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains, I advise you that, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to my attention that lead me to believe that the Registration Statement (other than (a) the financial statements and schedules (including the notes thereto and the auditor's reports thereon) included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (b) the other accounting, financial, reserve engineering and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I have not been asked to comment, and it being understood that I am making no statement as to the accuracy of any statement or representation in any exhibit to the Registration Statement), as of its effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (other than (a) the financial statements (including the notes thereto and the auditor's reports thereon) included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (b) the other accounting, financial, reserve engineering and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I have not been asked to comment), as of its issue date or the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
IV-4 omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In this letter, phrases such as "to my knowledge" and those with equivalent wording refer to my conscious awareness without any independent investigation. I am licensed to practice law in the State of Texas. The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of the laws of the State of Texas, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and applicable federal law. I am providing this opinion in my capacity as General Counsel of the Guarantor and not in my individual capacity as a lawyer. I am furnishing this letter to you solely for your use in connection with the transactions consummated on the date hereof under the Pricing Agreement and may not be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose. This letter speaks as of the date hereof, and I disclaim any obligation to update it. Very truly yours,
ANNEX V FORM OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL'S OPINION [Letterhead of Baker Botts L.L.P.] [ ] [ ], As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [ ] Ladies and Gentlemen: We are furnishing this opinion letter to you at the request of Marathon Oil Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), under Section 7(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated [ ] (the "Underwriting Agreement") that is incorporated by reference into the Pricing Agreement dated [ ] (the "Pricing Agreement") by and among Marathon Global Funding Corporation, a Nova Scotia corporation (the "Company"), the Guarantor and the several Underwriters Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement names (the "Underwriters"), relating to the sale by the Company to the Underwriters of [$___,000,000 aggregate principal amount of [ ] Notes due [ ] and $___,000,000 aggregate principal amount of [ ] Notes due [ ], fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor (such Notes, together with the guarantees relating thereto by the Guarantor (the "Guarantees"), being referred to herein as the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued under an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of [ ] among the Company, the Guarantor and [ ], as trustee. The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. #333-90034 and #333-90034-01) relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance therewith and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, of debt securities of the Company, to be fully unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, including the Securities. That registration statement which the Company and the Guarantor filed with the Commission on June 7, 2002, at the time that registration statement became effective, including all documents filed as part thereof or incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the prospectus dated June 17, 2002, together with the prospectus supplement dated [ ], each as filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Prospectus." We have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of the restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, of the Guarantor (the "Charter Documents"), the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Underwriting Agreement,
V-2 the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, the Establishment Action (as defined in the Indenture) relating to the Securities, the form of the Securities, corporate records of the Guarantor, including minute books of the Guarantor it has furnished to us, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Guarantor, statutes and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions we hereinafter express. In giving these opinions, we have relied on certificates of officers of the Guarantor and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters those certificates cover or contain, and we have assumed that all signatures on documents we have examined are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original copies of those documents and those original copies are authentic. In giving the opinions set forth in paragraphs 4 and 8 below, we have relied on oral advice of the staff of the Commission that the Commission has declared the Registration Statement effective under the 1933 Act. On the basis of the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications we set forth herein, we are of the following opinions: 1. The Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct the business of the Marathon Group as described in the Prospectus [as amended or supplemented]. 2. The Guarantor has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Pricing Agreement. 3. The Guarantor has duly authorized the issuance and sale of the Guarantees. When executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the Pricing Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture, the Securities will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and the Guarantees will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. The Securities and the Guarantees conform, as to legal matters, in all material respects to the descriptions thereof the Prospectus [as amended or supplemented] contains. 4. The Guarantor has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture, the Indenture constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company and the Guarantor, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act"). 5. The issuance and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees, the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Pricing Agreement and the compliance by the Guarantor with the terms of the Pricing Agreement will not result in any violation of (a) the Charter Documents, (b) the terms of any agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor or any Subsidiary is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject and listed on Schedule I
V-3 hereto or (c) the laws of the State of New York or Texas, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Federal laws of the United States. 6. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or registration or qualification with, any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Guarantor or any of its properties is required on the part of the Guarantor under any applicable law for issuance and sale of the Securities or the consummation of the other transactions the Pricing Agreement contemplates, except such as have been obtained under the 1933 Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as state securities or Blue Sky laws may require in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters. 7. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company and the Guarantor prior to the date hereof, as of their respective effective or issue dates, appear on their face to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the Trust Indenture Act. 8. The Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending its effectiveness has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose are pending before or threatened by the Commission. Any filing of the Prospectus Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act requires has been timely made in accordance with that rule. 9. We do not know of any pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings with respect to the Company or the Guarantor that are required to be disclosed in the Prospectus [as amended or supplemented], or any amendment or supplement thereto, which are not disclosed in the Prospectus [as amended or supplemented]. 10. Neither the Company nor the Guarantor is and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, will be an "investment company" as the Investment Company Act of 1940 defines that term. We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and Guarantor, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company and Guarantor, your representatives and your counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although we have not undertaken to determine independently, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains (except to the extent set forth in the last sentence of paragraph 3 above), we advise you that, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that lead us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of its issue date or the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In paragraph 7 above and in this paragraph, references to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus do not include references to any of the following, as
V-4 to which we have not been asked to comment, which the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains or incorporates by reference or omits: (a) the financial statements, including the notes and schedules, if any thereto, or the auditor's reports on the audited portions thereof, (b) the other accounting, financial, reserve engineering and statistical information, (c) any statement or representation in any exhibit to the Registration Statement or (d) the information respecting the business of the U.S. Steel Group. Our opinions above as to the enforceability of the Securities, the Guarantees, and the Indenture are subject to the effect of (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (c) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. In this letter, references to federal statutes include all amendments thereto and all rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, in each as in effect on the date hereof. In this letter, phrases such as "to our knowledge," "known to us" and those with equivalent wording refer to the conscious awareness of information by the lawyers of this Firm who have prepared or signed this letter or been actively involved in assisting and advising the Company and the Guarantor in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement, without any independent investigation by any lawyer of this Firm. Except as we otherwise expressly state, we limit our opinions in this letter in all respects to matters of the laws of the States of New York and Texas and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We are furnishing this letter to you solely for your use in connection with the transactions consummated on the date hereof under the Pricing Agreement, and it may not be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose. This letter speaks as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update it. Very truly yours,

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is herein expressly required, to the Company and the Guarantor. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. 9
The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantor in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security. The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Securities entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders of Securities. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Holder of Securities made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be. With regard to any record date, only the Holders of Securities on such date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or take, or vote on, the relevant action. SECTION 1.05 Notices, Etc., to Trustee, Company and Guarantor. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, (1) the Trustee by any Holder, the Company or the Guarantor shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with and received by the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or (2) the Company or the Guarantor by the Trustee or any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the address last furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company or the Guarantor, or, if no such address has been furnished, Treasurer, Marathon Oil Corporation, 5555 San Felipe Road, Houston, Texas 77056-2723. SECTION 1.06 Notice to Holders; Waiver of Notice. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at the address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be 10
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 1.07 Conflict With Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be. SECTION 1.08 Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 1.09 Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company and the Guarantor shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 1.10 Separability Clause. In case any provision in this Indenture, the Securities or the Guarantees shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 1.11 Benefits of Indenture; No Recourse Against Others. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. A director, officer, employee, stockholder, partner or other owner of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee, as such, shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities, for any obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees, or for any obligations of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee under this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of those obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all that liability. The waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of Securities. 11
SECTION 1.12 Governing Law.

SECTION 3.03 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Officer of the Company and on behalf of the Guarantor, by an Officer of the Guarantor, under their respective corporate seals reproduced thereon which may, but need not, be attested. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. The seal may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Security, and the failure to affix the seal of the Company or the Guarantor shall not affect the validity of the Securities or the Guarantees. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall bind the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company and the Guarantor to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by one or more Establishment Actions as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating: (1) if the form of such Securities has been established by an Establishment Action as permitted by Section 2.01, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by an Establishment Action as permitted by Section 3.01, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (3) that, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, such Securities and the related Guarantees will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general 22
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Establishment Action otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated as of the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.09, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or the related Guarantees. SECTION 3.04 Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company and the Guarantor may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company and the Guarantor will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until 23
so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture and the related Guarantees as definitive Securities of such series and tenor. SECTION 3.05 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Company shall cause to be kept in an office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment a register (the register maintained in any such office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and for transfers of Securities. The Trustee, or any other party serving in such capacity with the Trustee's consent, is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture and the related Guarantees, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 9.06 or 11.07 not involving any transfer. If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 11.03 and ending at the 24
close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. The provisions of the following clauses shall apply only to Global Securities: (1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless: (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act; (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security; or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 3.01. (3) Subject to clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct. (4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 3.04, 3.06, 9.06 or 11.07 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. SECTION 3.06 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security 25
of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture and the related Guarantees equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. SECTION 3.07 Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved. Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company or the Guarantor, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of 26
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company or the Guarantor shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon, the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 1.06, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company or the Guarantor may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 3.08 Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.07) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, 27
and neither the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 3.09 Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company or the Guarantor may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company or the Guarantor may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Until directed otherwise by a Company Order, all cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be conspicuously marked as such and thereafter treated in accordance with the Trustee's document retention policies; provided, however, if any cancelled Security is destroyed by the Trustee, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company a certificate with respect to such destruction. SECTION 3.10 Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), if in this Indenture or in any Security a rate of interest is or is to be calculated on the basis of a period which is less than a full calendar year, the yearly rate of interest to which such rate is equivalent shall be such rate multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is made and divided by the number of days in such period. The rates of interest set forth in this Indenture or in any Security will be calculated using the nominal rate method of calculation and will not be calculated using the effective rate method of calculation or on any other basis that gives effect to the principle of deemed re-investment of interest. In calculating interest or fees payable under this Indenture or on or with respect to a Security for any period, unless otherwise provided, the first day of such period shall be included and the last day of such period shall be excluded. ARTICLE IV SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE SECTION 4.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect with respect to any (or all) series of Securities (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such Securities, when: (1) either 28
(A) all such Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company or the Guarantor and thereafter repaid to the Company or the Guarantor or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company or the Guarantor, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by them; and (3) the Company or the Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such Securities have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.07, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02, Article VI and the last paragraph of Section 10.03 shall survive. 29
SECTION 4.02 Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company or the Guarantor acting as the Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. ARTICLE V REMEDIES SECTION 5.01 Events of Default. "Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company or the Guarantor in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company and the Guarantor by the Trustee or to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of a decree or an order (A) for relief in respect of the Company or the Guarantor in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law; 30
(B) adjudging the Company or the Guarantor a bankrupt or insolvent or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or the Guarantor under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law; (C) appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or the Guarantor or of any substantial part of its property; or (D) ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company or the Guarantor, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (6) (A) the commencement by the Company or the Guarantor of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal, State or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent; (B) the consent by the Company or the Guarantor to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of it in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal, State or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or the consent by it to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it; (C) the filing by the Company or the Guarantor of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal, State or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or the consent by the Company or the Guarantor to the filing of such petition; (D) the consent by the Company or the Guarantor to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or the Guarantor or of any substantial part of its property; (E) the making by the Company or the Guarantor of an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (F) the admission by the Company or the Guarantor in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; or (G) the taking of corporate action by the Company or the Guarantor in furtherance of any such action; 31
or (7) the Guarantor repudiates its obligations under the Guarantees, or the Guarantees become unenforceable or invalid or are no longer in full force and effect, except as expressly contemplated herein; or (8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. SECTION 5.02 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(5) or 5.01(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company and the Guarantor (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(5) or 5.01(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (1) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; 32
and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.03 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company and the Guarantor covenant that if (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, the Company or the Guarantor will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates (or yield to maturity in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, except as a result of the Trustee's negligence or bad faith. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. SECTION 5.04 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company or the Guarantor (or any other obligor upon the Securities), or their respective property or creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such 33
payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 except as a result of its negligence or bad faith. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee. SECTION 5.05 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel (except no such provision shall be made respecting compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances made as a result of Trustee's negligence), be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 5.06 Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses of collection, reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee except as a result of its negligence or bad faith. SECOND: In case the principal of the outstanding Securities of any series in respect of which such moneys have been collected shall not have become due, to the payment of interest on the Securities of such series, in the order of maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the same rate or the yield to maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified on the Securities of such series, such payments to be made ratably to the persons entitled thereto, without discrimination or preference. 34
THIRD: In case the principal of the outstanding Securities of any series in respect of which such moneys have been collected shall have become due, by declaration, or otherwise, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon the Securities of such series for principal, premium (if any) and interest, with interest upon the overdue principal, premium (if any) and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the same rate or the yield to maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified on the Securities of such series; and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon the Securities of such series, then to the payment of such principal, premium (if any) and interest, without preference or priority of principal and premium (if any), or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of such series over any other Security of such series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest. SECTION 5.07 Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless: (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) The Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. 35
SECTION 5.08 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 5.09 Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 5.10 Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 5.11 Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. SECTION 5.12 Control by Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that: 36
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture; and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 5.13 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default: (1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series; or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.14 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company or the Guarantor. SECTION 5.15 Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. Each of the Company and the Guarantor covenant (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company and the Guarantor (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waive all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. 37
ARTICLE VI THE TRUSTEE SECTION 6.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. SECTION 6.02 Notice of Defaults. If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 5.01(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event or events, as the case may be, specified in Section 5.01, not including periods of grace, if any, provided for therein. SECTION 6.03 Certain Rights of Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.01: (1) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, action, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order; and any resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or any Establishment Action may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution of the Company or an Establishment Action, as the case may be; and any resolution of the Board of Directors of the Guarantor may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board of Resolution of the Guarantor; (3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate; 38
(4) the Trustee may consult with counsel, and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, action, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company and the Guarantor, personally or by agent or attorney; (7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (8) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; and (9) the Trustee is not required to take notice or deemed to have notice of any default or Event of Default hereunder, except any Event of Default under Section 5.01(1), (2) or (3), unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or has received notice in writing of such default or Event of Default from the Company, the Guarantor or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, and, in the absence of any such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume that no such default or Event of Default exists. SECTION 6.04 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company and the Guarantor, as applicable, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. 39
SECTION 6.05 May Hold Securities. The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to 6.08 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company and the Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. SECTION 6.06 Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Trustee, or any Paying Agent, in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. Neither the Trustee nor any Paying Agent shall be under any liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Company. SECTION 6.07 Compensation, Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Company agrees: (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder and the costs and expenses of enforcing this right to indemnification. In the event any action, suit or proceeding is brought against any Trustee in connection with any claim for which it is entitled to indemnity hereunder, the Trustee shall promptly (but no later than ten days following service) notify the Company in writing, enclosing a copy of all papers served. All counsel employed to defend any such claim shall be retained directly by the Company and may serve as counsel to the Company, the Guarantor and/or one or more Trustees. Absent a conflict of interest, the Company shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of more than one law firm in connection with its obligations hereunder. A Trustee entitled to indemnification may, in addition to counsel engaged by the Company, engage counsel to represent such Trustee at its sole expense. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 40
Indenture, the Company shall not be liable to pay any settlement agreed to without its written consent. In the event the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in any proceedings which result from the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default under Section 5.01(5) or 5.01(6) hereof, or from the occurrence of any event which, solely by virtue of the passage of time, would become such an Event of Default, the expenses so incurred and compensation for services so rendered are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code or equivalent law. SECTION 6.08 Conflicting Interests. If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series. SECTION 6.09 Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be the Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. SECTION 6.10 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company and the Guarantor. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of 41
such series, delivered to the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (d) If, at any time, (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.08 after written request therefor by the Company, by the Guarantor or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company, by the Guarantor or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Company and the Guarantor by a Board Resolution of each of the Company and the Guarantor may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 5.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company or the Guarantor, by a Board Resolution of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series), provided that, if the Company and the Guarantor appoint different successor Trustees, the Guarantor's appointment shall prevail, and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company, the Guarantor and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in 42
accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company, the Guarantor or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (f) The Company or the Guarantor shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 1.06. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. SECTION 6.11 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company, the Guarantor and the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company, the Guarantor or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the Guarantor, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (ii) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and, upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided 43
therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company, the Guarantor or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be. No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 6.12 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. SECTION 6.13 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company or the Guarantor. If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company or the Guarantor (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company or the Guarantor (or any such other obligor). SECTION 6.14 Appointment of Authenticating Agent. The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.06, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and the related Guarantees and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each 44
Authenticating Agent must be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. In case at the time such successor to any Authenticating Agent with respect to any series shall succeed to such Authenticating Agent, any of the Securities of such series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to such Authenticating Agent may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Authenticating Agent and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities of such series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to any Authenticating Agent may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of successor Authenticating Agent; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the predecessor Authenticating Agent shall have; provided, however, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Authenticating Agent or to authenticate Securities in the name of any predecessor Authenticating Agent shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent, the Company and the Guarantor. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which must be acceptable to the Company and the Guarantor and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.06 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. 45
Any Authenticating Agent by the acceptance of its appointment shall be deemed to have agreed with the Trustee that: it will perform and carry out the duties of an Authenticating Agent as herein set forth; it will keep and maintain and furnish to the Trustee from time to time as requested by the Trustee appropriate records of all transactions carried out by it as Authenticating Agent and will furnish the Trustee such other information and reports as the Trustee may reasonably require; it is eligible for appointment as Authenticating Agent under this Section 6.14 and will notify the Trustee promptly if it shall cease to be so qualified; and it will indemnify the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee and will defend any claim asserted against the Trustee by reason of acts or failures to act of the Authenticating Agent but it shall have no liability for any action taken by it at the specific written direction of the Trustee. The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 6.07. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form: This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

The Guarantor covenants that it will not merge or consolidate with any other corporation or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, firm or corporation, except that the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with, or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets to, any other corporation, provided that: (1) (A) the Guarantor shall be the continuing corporation; or (B) (i) the successor corporation (if other than the Guarantor) shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof; and (ii) such corporation shall expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on all the Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor; and (2) the Guarantor or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall not, immediately after such merger or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, be in default in the performance of any such covenant or condition and no event which with the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both would constitute an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. For purposes of this Section 8.01, "substantially all of its assets" shall mean, at any date, a portion of the non-current assets reflected in the Guarantor's consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the most recent quarterly period that represents at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the total reported value of such assets.

With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, each when authorized by its Board of Directors, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby: (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or any other Security which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.02, or change the coin or currency in which any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or adversely affect any right of the Holder of any Security to require the Company to repurchase such Security; (2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture; (3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 5.13 or Section 10.07, except to increase any percentage set forth in such Sections or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section and Section 10.07, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6.11 and 9.01(8); or (4) modify or affect the obligations of the Guarantor under Article XIV in any manner adverse to the Holders. A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. 51
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. SECTION 9.03 Execution of Supplemental Indentures. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. SECTION 9.04 Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. SECTION 9.05 Conformity With Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act. SECTION 9.06 Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures. Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and the Guarantor and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. ARTICLE X COVENANTS SECTION 10.01 Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of (including any amount in respect of original issue discount) and any premium and interest on each of the Securities of such series at the Place of Payment, at the respective times and in the manner provided in the Securities and this Indenture. The principal of, premium, and interest on the Securities shall be payable only in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security. 52
SECTION 10.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and in each other Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company or the Guarantor in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or an affiliate of the Trustee, and each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby appoint the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and in each other Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. SECTION 10.03 Money for Securities Payments to be Held in Trust. If the Company or the Guarantor shall at any time act as the Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company will cause each Paying Agent, other than the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantor, for any series of Securities to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series. 53
Each of the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, having agreed to the foregoing on its behalf as a Paying Agent by its execution and delivery of this instrument, has hereby satisfied the provisions of this paragraph with respect to itself as a Paying Agent. The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company or the Guarantor, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company or the Guarantor) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in New York, New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company free of the trust formerly impressed upon it. SECTION 10.04 Statement by Officers as to Default. Each of the Company and the Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate, stating whether or not to the knowledge of the signers thereof the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. SECTION 10.05 Mortgage of Certain Property. For the benefit of the Holders of the Securities, if the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Guarantor shall Mortgage as security for any indebtedness for money borrowed any property capable of producing oil or gas which (i) is located in the United States and (ii) is determined to be a principal property by the Board of Directors of the Guarantor in its discretion, the Guarantor will secure or will cause such Subsidiary to secure each series of the Securities equally and ratably with all indebtedness or obligations secured by the Mortgage then being given and with any 54
other indebtedness of the Guarantor or such Subsidiary then entitled thereto; provided, however, that this covenant shall not apply in the case of: (1) any Mortgage existing on the date of this Indenture (whether or not such Mortgage includes an after-acquired property provision); (2) any Mortgage, including a purchase money Mortgage, incurred in connection with the acquisition of any property (for purposes hereof, the creation of any Mortgage within 180 days after the acquisition or completion of construction of such property shall be deemed to be incurred in connection with the acquisition of such property), the assumption of any Mortgage previously existing on such acquired property or any Mortgage existing on the property of any corporation when such corporation becomes a Subsidiary of the Guarantor; (3) any Mortgage on such property in favor of the United States of America, any State, or any agency, department, political subdivision or other instrumentality of either, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments to the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of any contract or any statute; (4) any Mortgage on such property in favor of the United States of America, any State, or any agency, department, political subdivision or other instrumentality of either, to secure borrowings by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Guarantor for the purchase or construction of the property Mortgaged; (5) any Mortgage in connection with a sale or other transfer of: (A) oil, gas or other minerals in place for a period of time until, or in an amount such that, the purchaser will realize therefrom a specified amount of money (however determined) or a specified amount of minerals; or (B) any interest in property of the character commonly referred to as an "oil payment" or "production payment"; (6) any Mortgage on any property arising in connection with or to secure all or any part of the cost of the repair, construction, improvement, alteration, exploration, development or drilling of such property or any portion thereof; (7) any Mortgage on any pipeline, gathering system, pumping or compressor station, pipeline storage facility, other pipeline facility, drilling equipment, drilling platform, drilling barge, any movable railway, marine or automotive equipment, gas plant, office building, storage tank, or warehouse facility, any of which is located at or on any such principal property; (8) any Mortgage on any equipment or other personal property used in connection with any such principal property; 55
(9) any Mortgage on any such principal property arising in connection with the sale of accounts receivable resulting from the sale of oil or gas at the wellhead; or (10) any renewal of or substitution for any Mortgage permitted under any of the preceding clauses. Notwithstanding the foregoing restriction contained in this Section 10.05, the Guarantor may and may permit its Subsidiaries to incur liens or grant Mortgages on property covered by the restriction above so long as the net book value of the property so encumbered, together with all property subject to the restriction on sale and leasebacks contained in Section 10.06, does not, at the time such lien or Mortgage is granted, exceed ten percent (10%) of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. SECTION 10.06 Sale and Leaseback of Certain Properties. For the benefit of the Holders of Securities, the Guarantor will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary of the Guarantor to, sell or transfer any property capable of producing oil or gas which (i) is located in the United States and (ii) is determined to be a principal property by the Board of Directors of the Guarantor in its discretion, with the intention of taking back a lease of such property; provided, however, this covenant shall not apply if: (1) the lease is between the Guarantor and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries; (2) the lease is for a temporary period by the end of which it is intended that the use of such property by the lessee will be discontinued; (3) the Guarantor or a Subsidiary of the Guarantor could, in accordance with Section 10.05, Mortgage such property without equally and ratably securing the Securities; (4) the transfer is incident to or necessary to effect any operating, farm-out, farm-in, unitization, acreage exchange, acreage contribution, bottom-hole or dry-hole arrangement or pooling agreement or any other agreement of the same general nature relating to the acquisition, exploration, maintenance, development or operation of oil or gas properties in the ordinary course of business or as required by any regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the property; or (5) (A) the Guarantor promptly informs the Trustee of such sale, (B) the net proceeds of such sale are at least equal to the fair value (as determined by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of the Guarantor) of such property and (C) the Guarantor shall, and in any such case the Guarantor covenants that it will, within 180 days after such sale, apply an amount equal to the net proceeds of such sale to the retirement of debt of the Guarantor, or of a Subsidiary in the case of property of such Subsidiary, maturing by its terms more than one year after the date on which it was originally incurred 56
(herein called "funded debt"); provided that the Guarantor shall not be obliged to retire more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of any series of Securities within five years from the date such Securities are issued; provided further that the amount to be applied to the retirement of funded debt of the Guarantor or of a Subsidiary shall be reduced by the amount below if, within 75 days after such sale, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (i) stating that on a specified date after such sale the Guarantor or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, voluntarily retired a specified principal amount of funded debt, (ii) stating that such retirement was not effected by payment at maturity or pursuant to any applicable mandatory sinking fund or prepayment provision (other than provisions requiring retirement of any funded debt of the Guarantor or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, under the circumstances referred to in this Section 10.06), and (iii) stating the then optional redemption or prepayment price applicable to the funded debt so retired or, if there is no such price applicable, the amount applied by the Guarantor or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, to the retirement of such funded debt. In the event of such a sale or transfer, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee a certified copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Guarantor referred to in the parenthetical phrase contained in subclause (5)(B) of this Section 10.06 and an Officers' Certificate setting forth all material facts under this Section 10.06. For the purposes of this Section 10.06 the term retirement of such funded debt shall include the "in substance defeasance" of such funded debt in accordance with then applicable accounting rules. SECTION 10.07 Waiver of Certain Covenants. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series, the Company and the Guarantor may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 3.01(18), 9.01(2) or 9.01(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series or in Section 10.05 or 10.06, if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. 57
ARTICLE XI REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES SECTION 11.01 Applicability of Article. Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article. SECTION 11.02 Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. SECTION 11.03 Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination or any integral multiple thereof) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal 58
amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 11.04 Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed, (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, (5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. SECTION 11.05 Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company or the Guarantor is acting as the Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.03) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. 59
SECTION 11.06 Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company and the Guarantor shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. SECTION 11.07 Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. ARTICLE XII SINKING FUNDS SECTION 12.01 Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for such Securities. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities as provided for by the terms of such Securities. 60
SECTION 12.02 Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities. The Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any Securities previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 12.03 Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund. Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 12.02 and will also deliver to the Trustee or cause to be delivered any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 15 nor more than 45 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.06 and 11.07. ARTICLE XIII DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE SECTION 13.01 Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Section 13.02 or Section 13.03 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to Section 3.01 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 13.02 or 13.03, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 3.01 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. Any such election shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for such Securities. 61

Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to have been discharged from their respective obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.04 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that (i) the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness of the Company represented by such Securities and the entire indebtedness of the Guarantor represented by the related Guarantees and (ii) the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to have satisfied all their respective other obligations under such Securities, the Guarantees and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 13.04 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's and the Guarantor's respective obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 10.02 and 10.03, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article.

(5) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act). (6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or the Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound.

(8) The Company or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

The Company or the Guarantor shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations and Foreign Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 13.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof, other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities. Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money, U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 13.04 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in 65
excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities. SECTION 13.06 Reinstatement. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company and the Guarantor have been discharged or released pursuant to Section 13.02 or 13.03 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 13.05 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company or the Guarantor makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust. ARTICLE XIV GUARANTEES SECTION 14.01 Guarantees. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees on a senior basis to the Holders from time to time (a) the full and prompt payment of the principal of and any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the stated maturity thereof, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, or in the event of default in any sinking fund payment, and (b) the full and prompt payment of any interest on any Security when and as the same shall become due, subject to any applicable grace period. Each payment by the Guarantor with respect to any Security shall be paid in the currency or currencies specified for payments on such Security as contemplated by Section 3.01 and pursuant to this Indenture. Each and every default in the payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on any Security shall give rise to a separate cause of action hereunder, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises. The Guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to a series of Securities shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Security, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor, and, subject to Section 8.03 and Articles IV and XIII, shall remain in full force and effect until the entire principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of such series shall have been paid or provided for in accordance with the provisions of such series and of this Indenture, and such payment shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening from time to time of any event, including 66
without limitation any of the following, whether or not with notice to, or the consent of, the Guarantor: (1) the waiver, surrender, compromise, settlement, release or termination of any or all of the obligations, covenants or agreements of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities of such series; (2) the failure to give notice to the Guarantor of the occurrence of a default or an Event of Default hereunder; (3) the waiver, compromise or release of the payment, performance or observance by the Company or the Guarantor of any or all of the obligations, covenants or agreements of either of them contained in this Indenture; (4) the extension of the time for payment of principal of any premium and interest on any Security of such series or for any other payment under this Indenture or of the time for performance of any other obligations, covenants or agreements under or arising out of this Indenture; (5) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any obligation, covenant or agreement set forth in this Indenture or the Securities of such series; (6) the taking or the omission of any of the actions referred to in this Indenture and any of the actions under the Securities of such series; (7) any failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of the Trustee to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on the Trustee in this Indenture, or any other act or acts on the part of the Trustee or any of the Holders from time to time of the Securities of such series; (8) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets, marshalling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting the Guarantor or the Company, or any of the assets of any of them, or any allegation or contest respecting the validity of the Guarantee in any such proceeding; (9) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge by operation of law of the Guarantor from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture; (10) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge by operation of law of the Company from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture; (11) the default or failure of the Guarantor or the Trustee fully to perform any of its obligations set forth in this Indenture or the Securities of such series; or 67
(12) the invalidity of this Indenture or the Securities of such series or any part of any thereof. No set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation, or any defense of any kind or nature which the Guarantor has or may have against the Trustee shall be available hereunder to the Guarantor against the Trustee to reduce the payments of the Guarantor under this Section 14.01. The Guarantor assumes responsibility for being and remaining informed of the financial condition of the Company and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of amounts owing under the Securities which diligent inquiry would reveal and agrees that the Holders of the Securities shall have no duty to advise the Guarantor of information known to any of them regarding such condition or any such circumstances. SECTION 14.02 Proceedings Against the Guarantor. In the event of a default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in any sinking fund payment, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on any Security when and as the same shall become due, each of the Trustee and the Holder of such Security shall have the right to proceed first and directly against the Guarantor under this Indenture without first proceeding against the Company or exhausting any other remedies which the Trustee or such Holder may have and without resorting to any other security held by it. The Trustee shall have the right, power and authority to do all things it deems necessary or advisable to enforce the provisions of this Indenture relating to the Guarantee and to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities and, in the event of a default in payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in any sinking fund payment, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on any Security when and as the same shall become due, the Trustee may institute or appear in such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of its rights and the rights of the Holders, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture relating to the Guarantee or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a default in payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on any Security when due, the Trustee may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Guarantor and collect the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by applicable law out of the property of the Guarantor, wherever situated. SECTION 14.03 Guarantees for Benefit of Holders. The Guarantees contained in this Indenture are provided by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders from time to time. Such provisions shall not be deemed to create any right in, or 68
to be in whole or in part for the benefit of any Person other than, the Trustee, the Guarantor, the Holders from time to time and their permitted successors and assigns. 69

MARATHON GLOBAL FUNDING CORPORATION % NOTES DUE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY MARATHON OIL CORPORATION This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2002, (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company, as Issuer, Marathon Oil Corporation, as Guarantor and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $ . The Securities of this series are subject to redemption prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' notice by mail, at any time, in whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. "Business Day" means any calendar day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in New York, New York or Houston, Texas and on which commercial banks are open for business in New York, New York and Houston, Texas. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. 1
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors, and two other firms that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer") which the Company specifies from time to time; provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Securities to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date. Notice of the redemption will be mailed to holders of Securities by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. 2
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on or after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or of certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holders for one or more of the following purposes: (1) to evidence the succession of another corporation to the Company or the Guarantor; (2) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor; (3) to add additional events of default for the benefit of Holders of all or any series of Securities; (4) to add to or change provisions of the Indenture to allow the issuance of Securities in other forms; (5) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities thereunder, under certain conditions specified therein; (6) to secure the Securities pursuant to the requirements of Section 10.05 of the Indenture or otherwise; (7) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01 of the Indenture; (8) to evidence the appointment of a successor Trustee; and (9) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision of the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision of the Indenture, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture as shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company and the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and 3

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

In our capacity as your special Nova Scotia counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined (i) the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of Marathon Funding (together, the "CHARTER DOCUMENTS"), (ii) the Indenture dated as of June 14, 2002 among Marathon Funding, as issuer, Marathon, as guarantor, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (the "INDENTURE"), pursuant to which the Marathon Funding Securities may be issued, and (iii) the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of corporate records of Marathon Funding, certificates of public officials and of representatives of Marathon Funding, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereafter expressed.
Marathon Oil Corporation June 21, 2002 Page 2 In expressing our opinion in paragraph 1 we have relied exclusively upon a certificate of status pertaining to Marathon Funding issued on behalf of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies for the Province of Nova Scotia, dated June 13, 2002. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 1. Marathon Funding is an unlimited company duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia. 2. Assuming that (i) the Indenture constitutes and enforceable obligation of Marathon Funding under the laws of the State of New York as provided therein, (ii) the Marathon Funding Securities have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and (iii) the choice of the laws of the State of New York to govern the Debt Securities is bona fide, the choice of the laws of the State of New York to govern the Debt Securities will be upheld as a valid choice of law and, if specifically pleaded and proved, the laws of the State of New York will be applied by the courts of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia, except with respect to procedure, which will be governed by the laws of Nova Scotia; provided that such choice of law is not contrary to public policy, as that term is understood under Nova Scotia law. Based solely on our review of the Indenture and our review otherwise described above but without having any knowledge of New York law we have no reason to believe that a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would refuse to apply New York law to govern the Debt Securities. The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to Marathon's current report on Form 8-K reporting the offering of the Marathon Funding Securities. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

EXHIBIT 5.2 [BAKER BOTTS L.L.P. LETTERHEAD] June 21, 2002 Marathon Oil Corporation 5555 San Felipe Road Houston, Texas 77056-2723 Gentlemen: Marathon Oil Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Marathon"), has engaged us to render to it the opinions we express below in connection with the offering of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes due July 1, 2012 (the "Marathon Funding Securities") of Marathon Global Funding Corporation, a Nova Scotia unlimited liability company ("Marathon Funding"), fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Marathon (the "Marathon Guarantees" and, together with the Marathon Funding Securities, the "Securities"), which Marathon and Marathon Funding are offering under the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended by pre-effective amendment no. 1 thereto (Reg. Nos. 333-90034 and 333-90034-01), Marathon and Marathon Funding filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), which relates to their offering and sale of various securities under the 1933 Act's Rule 415. In this letter, "Registration Statement" means that registration statement, as amended, when it became effective under the 1933 Act. Marathon and Marathon Funding will issue the Securities under an indenture dated as of June 14, 2002 among Marathon Funding, Marathon and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee, relating to the debt securities of Marathon Funding fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Marathon (the "Indenture").

In giving these opinions, we have relied on certificates of officers of Marathon and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters those certificates cover or contain, and we have assumed that all signatures on documents we have examined are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original copies of those documents and those original copies are authentic. We base the opinions we express below in part on the following assumptions we have made: o the board of directors of Marathon Funding or any committee which such board has duly designated in accordance with the organizational documents of Marathon Funding and applicable law (the board or any such committees being the "Board") will have taken all corporate action necessary to: o authorize the issuance of the Marathon Funding Securities; and o approve the terms of the offering and sale of the Marathon Funding Securities; o the Indenture will have been duly authorized by Marathon Funding; o in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Board will have designated and established the terms of the series to which the Marathon Funding Securities belong and the Marathon Funding Securities will not include any provision that is unenforceable; and o Marathon Funding will have duly authorized the Underwriting Agreements. On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 1. Marathon is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
BAKER BOTTS L.L.P. Marathon Oil Corporation 3 June 21, 2002 2. The Marathon Funding Securities will, when issued and duly purchased and paid for in accordance with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreements, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Marathon Funding, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture under which they are issued and enforceable against Marathon Funding in accordance with their terms, and the related Marathon Guarantees will, when issued, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Marathon, enforceable against Marathon in accordance with their terms, except, in each case, as that enforcement is subject to (a) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity, regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and (c) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. We limit the opinions we express above in all respects to matters of the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, each as in effect on the date hereof. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.2 to Marathon's current report on Form 8-K reporting the offering of the Securities. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit we are in the category of persons whose written consent Section 7 of the 1933 Act requires to be filed with the Registration Statement.
