Item 5. Other Events.
        On March 19, 2004, Marathon Oil Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Marathon") announced that it had entered into an agreement with Ashland Inc. ("Ashland") pursuant to which Ashland will transfer to Marathon Ashland's 38% ownership interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC ("MAP") and a portion of Ashland's instant oil change business consisting of 61 Valvoline Instant Oil Change Centers located in Ohio and Michigan and Ashland's maleic anhydride business, the associated plant in West Virginia and related assets. Under the terms of the agreement, Ashland shareholders would receive $315 million in Marathon common stock. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Ashland would receive redemption proceeds of approximately $800 million in cash and accounts receivable, and Marathon would assume approximately $1.9 billion of new debt. MAP will not make quarterly cash distributions to Marathon and Ashland between the date the principal transaction agreements were signed and the closing of the transaction. As a result, the final amount of redemption proceeds to be received by Ashland would be increased by an amount equal to approximately 38% of the cash accumulated from MAP's operations during that period. Ashland's liabilities under certain existing environmental indemnification obligations related to MAP will be capped at $50 million. In connection with the proposed transaction, we estimate that the present value of the obligations that MAP will effectively assume, as a result of that cap, will be approximately $15 million. On completion of the transaction, MAP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon.
        The completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, (1) the approval of the transaction by Ashland's shareholders; (2) Ashland's and Marathon's receipt and the continuing effectiveness of a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to the tax treatment of several aspects of the transaction; (3) Ashland's and Marathon's receipt of tax opinions covering specified matters relating to the proposed transaction; (4) Ashland's and Marathon's receipt of updates of opinions as to the solvency of Ashland and New EXM Inc., a subsidiary of Ashland that will be the publicly owned successor to Ashland and will change its name to Ashland Inc.; (5) Ashland's receipt of irrevocable consents with respect to 90% of the aggregate principal amount of substantially all of its outstanding publicly held debt (with the consent of 66/% of the aggregate principal amount of a series constituting a consent for the entire series); and (6) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

Except as otherwise contemplated or provided in the Tax Matters Agreement, any of the other Transaction Agreements or any of the Ancillary Agreements, the Ashland Parties acknowledge that their sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims (other than (i) claims arising from covenants to the extent such covenants are to be performed after the Closing and (ii) claims of fraud) relating to the Transaction Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XIII.

In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax Benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt or accrual of any indemnity payment hereunder or the deductibility of any indemnified Loss.  Any indemnification payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to clauses (i) and (ii) in the second sentence of this Section 13.03, and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such net Tax cost (including gross-up) or net Tax Benefit only after the indemnified party has actually realized such cost or benefit.  For purposes of this Agreement, an indemnified party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax cost or a net Tax Benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such indemnified party is increased above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes, that such indemnified party would be required to pay but for the receipt or accrual of the indemnity payment or the deductibility of such Loss, as the case may be.

Each such indemnified party shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

Such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to the Third Party Claim (if reasonably attainable) and the basis of the indemnified party's request for indemnification under this Agreement.  The failure of the indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party of the Third Party Claim shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any duty to indemnify hereunder unless and only to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the failure of the indemnified party to promptly notify it of such Third Party Claim prejudiced its ability to defend such Third Party Claim; , that the failure of the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to the indemnified party otherwise than under this Agreement.

If it elects to assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall defend such Third Party Claim by promptly and vigorously prosecuting all appropriate proceedings to a final conclusion or settlement.  After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim using counsel of its choice, but the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with its participation in the defense thereof unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 13.04(b) or diligently prosecute the defense of the Third Party Claim or (iii) there shall exist or develop a conflict that would ethically prohibit counsel to the indemnifying party from representing the indemnified party.  The indemnified party agrees to provide such reasonable cooperation to the indemnifying party and its counsel as the indemnifying party may reasonably request in contesting any Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the Third Party asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any person who is not an affiliate or Representative of the indemnified party, in each case only if and to the extent that any such counterclaim or cross-complaint arises from the same actions or facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim.

 If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.04(b), then the indemnified party shall have the right to defend the Third Party Claim by promptly and vigorously prosecuting all appropriate proceedings to a final conclusion or settlement.  The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim using counsel of its choice, but the indemnified party shall not be liable to the indemnifying party hereunder for any legal or other expenses incurred by the indemnifying party in connection with its participation in the defense thereof.  If requested by the indemnified party, the indemnifying party agrees to provide such reasonable cooperation to the indemnified party and its counsel as the indemnified party may reasonably request in contesting any Third Party Claim that the indemnified party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the third party asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any person who is not an affiliate or Representative of the indemnifying party, in each case only if and to the extent that any such counterclaim or cross-complaint arises from the same actions or facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim.

  In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying party under Section 13.01 or 13.02 that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party.  Subject to Sections 13.01(b) and 13.02(b), the failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 13.01 or 13.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced by such failure.  The indemnifying party shall have 60 calendar days following its receipt of such notice to dispute its liability to the indemnified party under Section 13.01 or 13.02.  The indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the indemnifying party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the indemnified party and in otherwise resolving such matters.  Such cooperation and assistance shall include retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records that are reasonably relevant to such matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and providing such reasonable cooperation and assistance in the investigation and resolution of such matters as the indemnifying party may reasonably request.  If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within 60 days from its receipt of a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 13.04(d) that the indemnifying party disputes the claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice, that claim shall be deemed a liability of the indemnifying party hereunder.  If the indemnifying party has timely disputed that claim, as provided above, that dispute may be resolved by proceedings in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 14.10 if the parties do not reach a settlement of that dispute within 30 days after notice of that dispute is given.  Payment of the amount set forth in a notice of a claim pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 13.04(d) that has not been disputed shall be made

Carrybacks and Carryforwards.
Marathon Group (including former members of the Ashland Group) not to carryback any Tax Item attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a member of the Ashland Group or of the New Ashland Inc.

Group (including a former member of the Ashland Group) results in a Tax Detriment to any member of the New Ashland Inc. Group (or former member of the Ashland Group), Marathon shall pay to New Ashland Inc. the Tax Loss realized by the New Ashland Inc. Group by reason of such carryback.
 
(b)  To the extent permissible by the applicable Tax law, with respect to any Tax Item attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that may be carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period of a member of the Marathon Group (including a former member of the Ashland Group), New Ashland Inc. shall cause each member of the New Ashland Inc. Group or of the Ashland Group to carry back any such Tax Item and not to carry forward any such Tax Item to such a Post-Closing Tax Period of a member of the Marathon Group (including a former member of the Ashland Group).  To the extent that New Ashland Inc. is not permitted by applicable law to carry back such Tax Item or to forgo such carry forward of such Tax Item and requests that Marathon obtain a Refund, reduction or offset of Tax with respect to such carry forward, then Marathon shall take all reasonable measures to obtain such a Refund, reduction or offset with respect to the carry forward (including by filing an amended return) and shall pay to New Ashland Inc. the Tax Savings realized by any member of the Marathon Group by reason of such carry forward, including any interest received thereon (provided, further, that the out-of-pocket costs associated with claiming any such carryforward shall be borne by New Ashland Inc.).

Such Tax Savings or Tax Loss shall be considered to arise at the time that such party's decreased or increased payment (respectively) for such taxable period is first due or otherwise actually realized
as a change in the amount of Tax or Refund, reductions or credit of Tax then due and payable.  If any party is considered under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 4.01 to realize a Tax Savings for which it is required to make a payment, or Tax Loss with respect to which the other party is required to make a payment, the party required to make such payment shall make such payment within 30 days of the date such Tax Savings or Tax Loss is considered to arise.
 
(d)  For purposes of this Section 4.01, a Tax Item is deemed to be attributable to the taxable period in which it first accrued or was otherwise taken into account for Tax purposes.  For the avoidance of doubt, a net operating loss, foreign tax credit or similar Tax Item is deemed to be attributable to the taxable period in which the loss, foreign tax or equivalent event giving rise to such Tax Item first accrued or was otherwise taken into account for Tax purposes.

Ashland and Marathon Company shall execute and deliver an amendment to the MAP LLC Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, that shall specially allocate to Marathon Company any Pass-Through Items that would be allocable to New Ashland Inc. in the absence of such amendment and that are attributable to a payment that is (1) described in Section 12.01(d)(vii) of the Master Agreement, which results in a special non-pro rata distribution to Ashland, or (2) made with respect to the St. Paul Park QQQ Project or the Plains Settlement (as both are described in Section 9.09 of the Master Agreement).  If any such payment produces a Tax Benefit for any member of the New Ashland Inc. Group, then New Ashland Inc. shall pay to Marathon the amount of any resulting Tax Savings actually realized by such member of the New Ashland Inc. Group within 30 days of the date that such Tax Savings is realized.  Such Tax Savings shall be considered to be realized by a member of the New Ashland Inc. Group or the Marathon Group, as the case may be, pursuant to the principles of Section 4.01(c) above.
Special Allocation of Certain Deductions.
 
SECTION 4.03.    If as a result of a Final Determination with respect to whether certain refinery assets contributed by Ashland to MAP are considered to be asset class 13.3 (Petroleum Refining) or 28.0 (Manufacture of Chemicals and Allied Products), New Ashland Inc. pays any additional Tax with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and such Final Determination results in the increase in the adjusted Tax basis as of the date of such contribution of any asset or property of MAP that was contributed by Ashland to MAP, Marathon shall cause MAP to take depreciation deductions with respect to such additional Tax basis to the maximum extent allowed, and as promptly as permitted, by applicable law, which shall include Marathon causing MAP to amend any relevant Tax Return of MAP.

SECTION 5.01.    (a)    The parties will request the IRS to issue a private letter ruling holding that New Ashland Inc. is entitled to claim the Specified Liability Deductions.  If the IRS issues such a private letter ruling, the Specified Liability Deductions shall be claimed by New Ashland Inc. on the New Ashland Inc. Affiliated Group's consolidated Federal income tax return and not by Marathon or any member of the Marathon Group.
Deduction of Specified Liability Deductions.
Request for Tax Ruling.
 
(b)    If the IRS is unwilling to issue the ruling described in Section 5.01(a) above, the parties will request the IRS to issue a private letter ruling holding that HoldCo (which shall include for purposes of this Article V Marathon or any member of the Marathon Affiliated Group that is the "acquiring corporation" of HoldCo in the Acquisition Merger within the meaning of Code Section 381(a)) is entitled to claim the Specified Liability Deductions under the Net Deduction Method and that the use of the Specified Liability Deductions by HoldCo is not limited under Code Sections 382, 384 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-15 (the "Alternative Ruling").  If the IRS issues the Alternative Ruling, the Specified Liability Deductions shall be claimed by HoldCo on the Marathon Affiliated Group's consolidated Federal income tax return for each taxable period in which the Alternative Ruling is in effect and not by New Ashland Inc. or any member of the New Ashland Inc. Group, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.01(c) below.  The amount of the Specified Liability Deductions claimed by Marathon shall be determined under the Net Deduction Method unless the parties agree in writing that a different method should be used or unless there is a Final Determination requiring a different method.  Unless explicitly provided to the contrary in this Article V, Marathon shall retain full control over all Tax Items on its Tax Returns.
Request for Alternative IRS Ruling.
 
(c)    (i)  If the IRS issues the Alternative Ruling, the parties will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to initiate a judicial proceeding (and any necessary administrative proceedings) to obtain a Final Determination that New Ashland Inc. is entitled to claim the Specified Liability Deductions;  that the parties shall not initiate such a judicial proceeding unless and until they have entered into the agreement described in Section 5.01(c)(ii) below; that the parties shall not initiate such a judicial proceeding if either New Ashland Inc. or Marathon determines, in its good faith judgment, that it is reasonably possible that such a proceeding may result in adverse consequences to New Ashland Inc. or Marathon, respectively.  Possible adverse consequences include but are not limited to causing the Tax Ruling not to be binding on the IRS; credit risk; possible impairment of the reputation of either party; and possible impairment of the relationship between either party and the IRS.  The parties expect that any such proceeding shall be initiated by an amended return filed by New Ashland Inc. claiming the Specified Liability Deductions and requesting a Refund of Tax based on that claim and, if the IRS does not timely grant that Refund, a lawsuit filed by New Ashland
Litigation in the Event of Alternative IRS Ruling.

Inc. in the appropriate Federal court (as determined by New Ashland Inc. in its sole reasonable discretion) seeking such Refund.
 
(ii)  Before initiating such a proceeding, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach and enter into an agreement specifying the appropriate actions, if any, to be taken by the Marathon Affiliated Group with respect to its claim of such Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable years, and the recomputation and possible reversal of any Tax Benefit Payments made by Marathon with respect to such taxable years.  The goals of such negotiation shall be to preserve the Tax Benefits of the Specified Liability Deductions for all relevant taxable years in a manner that is consistent with such Final Determination, the Tax Ruling and the economic arrangements described in this Article V, and that keeps Marathon whole for any assessments of Tax resulting from such Final Determination without subjecting Marathon to any significant incremental credit risk.  If agreement is reached, the parties shall execute an agreement binding on both parties.
 
(iii)  If such a proceeding results in a Final Determination that New Ashland Inc. is entitled to claim the Specified Liability Deductions, then New Ashland Inc. shall claim the Specified Liability Deductions on the New Ashland Inc. Affiliated Group's consolidated Federal income tax returns that are due on or after the date of such Final Determination and neither Marathon nor any member of the Marathon Group shall claim such deductions on returns filed after such date.  New Ashland Inc. shall be entitled to claim  Specified Liability Deductions for prior years only to the extent provided in the agreement described in Section 5.01(c)(ii) above.
 
SECTION 5.02    (a) (i)  If the IRS issues the Alternative Ruling, then for each taxable year for which HoldCo claims the Specified Liability Deductions it shall make a payment to New Ashland Inc. in respect of the Federal Tax Benefits attributable to such Specified Liability Deductions (the "Federal Tax Benefit Payment") and one or more payments to New Ashland Inc. in respect of the state, local or foreign Tax Benefits attributable to such Specified Liability Deductions (the "Non-Federal Tax Benefit Payment" and, together with the Federal Tax Benefit Payment, the "Tax Benefit Payments").
Tax Benefit Payments from Marathon to New Ashland Inc.
 
(ii)  The Federal Tax Benefit Payment for a taxable year shall equal the sum of the Basket One Amount and the Basket Two Amount for such taxable year.  The Non-Federal Tax Benefit Payment for a taxable year shall be determined with respect to the entire amount of Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable year on a "with and without" basis under the methodology and principles applicable solely to the Basket Two Amount, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the differences between the Code and the applicable Tax law for such purpose, and there shall be no Basket One Amount or Basket One Deductions for such purpose.  For purposes of calculating the Tax Benefit Payments, the amount of the Specified Liability Deductions shall be determined using the Net Deduction Method unless the parties agree in writing that a different method should be used or unless there is a Final Determination requiring a different method.
(iii)  The Tax Benefit Payments shall be paid directly to New Ashland Inc. or placed in escrow as provided in Article VI below.
 
(b) (i)    For each taxable year of HoldCo ending on or before January 1, 2025, the Basket One Amount shall equal the Basket One Tax Rate multiplied by the Basket One Deductions for such taxable year.  For each taxable year ending on or after January 1, 2025, the Basket One Amount, and the Basket One Deductions, shall be $0.00.
Basket One Amount.
 
(ii) 
Definitions.
 
(A)   The Basket One Tax Rate for a taxable year shall equal the highest marginal Federal income tax rate applicable to corporations for such taxable year minus 3 percentage points.  As of the date of this TMA, the Basket One Tax Rate is 32% (35%  currently the highest marginal Federal income tax rate applicable to corporations (Section 11 of the Code)  minus 3 percentage points).
 
(B)   The Basket One Deductions for a taxable year shall equal the lesser of (I) the Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable year and (II) the Basket One Cap for such taxable year.
 
(C)   The Basket One Cap for a taxable year shall equal (I) $30 million adjusted by the Inflation Factor, but in no event more than $60 million (the "Basket One Cap Base Amount"), plus (II) the unused Basket One Cap Carryforward, if any, from each of the two preceding taxable years.  The Basket One Cap Carryforward originating in a taxable year shall equal the excess, if any, of the Basket One Cap Base Amount for such taxable year over the Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable year.  Specified Liability Deductions for a taxable year shall be considered to be used first against, and to the extent of, the Basket One Cap Base Amount for such taxable year.  For purposes of determining the amount of the Basket One Cap Carryforward "used" in a particular taxable year, the excess, if any, of the Specified Liability Deductions for that taxable year over the Basket One Cap Base Amount for such taxable year shall be considered to be used first against, and the extent of, the Basket One Cap Carryforward originating in the second preceding taxable year; and next against, and to the extent of, the Basket One Cap Carryforward originating in the immediately preceding taxable year.
 
(c)  (i)        The Basket Two Amount for a taxable year shall be determined on a "with and without" basis to measure the actual Tax savings realized by the Marathon Affiliated Group from its use of Basket Two Deductions and Basket Two Carryovers, and shall equal the excess (if any) of (A) the amount of Federal income tax that the Marathon Affiliated Group would have been required to pay with respect to such taxable year if there were no Basket Two Deductions for, and no Basket Two Carryovers to, such taxable year over (B) the amount of Federal income tax that the Marathon Affiliated Group was actually required to pay with respect to such taxable year.
Basket Two Amount.
(ii) 
Definitions.
 
(A)   The Basket Two Deductions for a taxable year shall equal the excess, if any, of (I) the total Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable year over (II) the Basket One Deductions for such taxable year.
 
(B)   The Basket Two Carryovers to a taxable year shall equal the amount of Basket Two Carryovers originating in other taxable years and carried forward or carried back to such taxable year.  The Basket Two Carryovers originating in a taxable year are the carryovers of net operating losses, excess foreign tax credits, minimum tax credits or other Tax Items of the Marathon Affiliated Group, if any, that originate in such year under the principles of the Code, but only to the extent such carryovers are greater than the amount of such carryovers that would have originated in such taxable year if the Marathon Affiliated Group had no Basket Two Deductions for such taxable year and no Basket Two Carryovers to such taxable year.  Carryovers of all Tax Items shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations governing the carry forward, carryback, use, limitation and expiration of carryovers of the relevant type of Tax Item.  If the carryover of a Tax Item originating in a taxable year includes a portion that is a Basket Two Carryover and another portion that is not a Basket Two Carryover, such portions shall be considered to be used on a "with and without basis" as described in Section 5.02(c)(i) above.
 
(d)     The Basket One Amount for a taxable year, once determined, shall not be redetermined for any reason other than an adjustment in the amount of the Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable year resulting from a Tax Claim with respect to the New Ashland Inc. Affiliated Group or the Marathon Affiliated Group by a Tax Authority.  The Basket Two Amount for a taxable year shall be redetermined at appropriate times (, payment, refund, or Final Determination), taking into account actual adjustments with respect to Tax Claims and subsequent events that affect the calculation of the Basket Two Amount, including carry forwards and carrybacks.  Payments of the increased or decreased amount of any Tax Benefit Payments for any taxable year shall be made as provided in Article VI below.
Redeterminations.
e.g.
 
(e)    For each taxable year, unless Marathon and New Ashland Inc. otherwise agree, New Ashland Inc. at its own expense will cause a nationally recognized accounting firm to prepare and deliver to Marathon a certificate, in a form acceptable to Marathon, verifying the amount and deductibility of the Specified Liability Deductions for such taxable year (taking into account any issues raised by the IRS from time to time).  New Ashland Inc. will at its own expense provide to Marathon a written opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP or any other law firm acceptable to Marathon, which opinion shall be addressed to New Ashland Inc. and may rely on the Alternative Ruling, to the effect that Marathon will be entitled to deduct the Specified Liability Deductions on its Tax Return.  Such opinion shall be updated or amended, from time to time, as Marathon may reasonably request to take into account material changes in facts or in law.  For each taxable year, unless Marathon and New Ashland Inc. otherwise agree, Marathon at its own expense will cause a nationally

recognized accounting firm to prepare and deliver to New Ashland Inc. a certificate verifying the amount of Tax Benefit Payments for such taxable year, no such verification shall be required with respect to Non-Federal Tax Benefit Payments with respect to any jurisdiction in which the Tax liability of Marathon and the other members of the Marathon Group for such taxable year is less than $500,000 unless New Ashland Inc. agrees to bear the cost of such verification.
provided that
 
(f) (i)    The parties have set forth the examples in Exhibit B attached hereto to illustrate the application of this Article V and of Article VI below.  The parties have also agreed that Tax Benefit Payments in respect of the Basket One Amount shall be payable without regard to whether Marathon or any member of the Marathon Group realizes an actual Tax savings from the use of the Basket One Deductions; that Tax Benefit Payments in respect of the Basket Two Amount shall be payable only to the extent that the Marathon Affiliated Group realizes an actual Tax savings from the use of the Basket Two Deductions on a "with and without" basis; and that any Specified Liability Deduction shall potentially give rise to a single Basket One Amount or Basket Two Amount and shall not be double-counted.  Any uncertainties or ambiguities in the computation of the Tax Benefit Payments for any taxable year shall be resolved in a manner that is consistent with the examples in Exhibit B and with such principles.
Principles and Examples.
 
(ii)    The provisions of Article V and Article VI are based on taxable years of twelve full months.  The application of such provisions shall be appropriately adjusted in the event of one or more taxable years of less than 12 months to effectuate the goals and principles of Article V and Article VI.
Short Taxable Years.
 
(iii)    In the event that there is a successor to the New Ashland Inc. Affiliated Group or the Marathon Affiliated Group, the provisions of this Article V shall be applied to such successors as if they were the New Ashland Inc. Affiliated Group or the Marathon Affiliated Group, respectively.
Successors.

Time of Tax Benefit Payments.
Original Payments.
 
(i)    If New Ashland Inc. provides to Marathon a good faith estimate of the amount of the Specified Liability Deductions for a calendar year by November 30th of such year, and verification of the Specified Liability Deductions as required in Section 5.02(e) for such calendar year by February 28th of the following year, then Marathon shall pay to New Ashland Inc. or Escrow, as the case may be, the amount of the Federal Tax Benefit Payment for the taxable year corresponding to

If New Ashland Inc. does not provide to Marathon the estimate and the actual determination of the Specified Liability Deductions within the time requirements of the preceding sentence, then Marathon shall pay to New Ashland Inc. or Escrow, as the case may be, the amount of the Federal Tax Benefit Payment for such taxable year within 10 days of the later of (A) the date on which New Ashland Inc. provides such determination to Marathon and (B) the due date of the Federal corporate income Tax Return for the Marathon Affiliated Group, with extensions for such taxable year (generally September 15th), in each case without interest.
 
(ii)    Marathon shall pay to New Ashland Inc. or Escrow, as the case may be, in each case without interest, the amount of the Non-Federal Tax Benefit Payments for a taxable year within 30 days after the due date of the relevant HoldCo separate or combined, as the case may be, state, local or foreign Tax Returns, with extensions.
Non-Federal Tax Benefit Payments.
 
(b)    If an event giving rise to the redetermination of a Tax Benefit Payment for any taxable year occurs as provided in Section 5.02(d) above, the party becoming aware of such event shall promptly notify the other party.
Redeterminations.
 
(i)  If such redetermination increases the amount of such Tax Benefit Payment, then within 30 days after the receipt by Marathon of a Refund corresponding to such Tax Benefit Payment, or, if there is no such Refund, then within 30 days after such redetermination, Marathon shall pay to New Ashland Inc. or Escrow, as the case may be, the amount of such increase, together with the corresponding amount of interest (if any) payable by the relevant Tax Authority with respect to such redetermination.
 
(ii)  If such redetermination decreases the amount of such Tax Benefit Payment, then, within 30 days after the payment by Marathon of the Tax corresponding to such redetermination, or, if there is no such Tax payment, then within 30 days after such redetermination, the amount of such decrease (including any interest, penalty or addition to Tax resulting from such redetermination) shall be paid to Marathon as provided in this Section 6.01(b)(ii).  Such decrease shall be paid first by paying to Marathon amounts in Escrow up to the amount of such decrease (and all future payments to New Ashland Inc. under this TMA for the current taxable year and subsequent taxable years shall be escrowed until the Escrow is Fully Funded, as provided in Section 6.02(c) below).  If such decrease exceeds the amount so paid to Marathon from the Escrow, New Ashland Inc. shall pay such excess to Marathon;  if the total amount that New Ashland Inc. would be required to pay to Marathon in a particular calendar year under this Section 6.01(b)(ii) as a result of any and all redeterminations exceeds $25 million, then New Ashland Inc. may pay such excess over $25 million in eight equal semi-annual payments, with the first payment due six months from the date of such

provided further that
 
SECTION 6.02    (a)    In the event that any Tax Benefit Payments are required under this Agreement to be placed in Escrow, the parties will execute an Escrow Agreement in the form as to be agreed to by the parties and attached hereto as Exhibit C to this TMA.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, The Bank of New York shall serve as escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement.  The out-of-pocket costs and expenses of creating and maintaining the Escrow, including the fees of the escrow agent, shall be shared equally by Marathon and New Ashland Inc.
Escrow.
Escrow Agreement.
 
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.02(b), all Tax Benefit Payments in respect of Basket One Amounts shall be paid by Marathon directly to New Ashland Inc. and shall not be placed in Escrow.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tax Benefit Payments in respect of Basket One Amounts shall be placed in Escrow in the following circumstances:
Basket One Benefits.
 
(i)  If New Ashland Inc. has undergone a Bankruptcy Event, all Tax Benefit Payments in respect of Basket One Amounts otherwise payable by Marathon to New Ashland Inc. on or after the date of such Bankruptcy Event shall be placed in Escrow as if they were in respect of Basket Two Amounts until such time that any judgment, order, proceeding or petition that constitutes a Bankruptcy Event has been dismissed or discharged.
 
(ii) In the circumstances described in Section 6.02(d)below.
 
(c)    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.02(c) all Tax Benefit Payments in respect of Basket Two Amounts shall be paid by Marathon directly to New Ashland Inc. and shall not be placed in Escrow.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tax Benefit Payments in respect of Basket Two Amounts shall be placed in Escrow in the following circumstances:

(A)  The Escrow shall be considered to be Fully Funded at the time a Tax Benefit Payment for a taxable year is required to be made if the amount in the Escrow at such time is equal to the excess (if any) of (I) the total amount of Tax Benefit Payments other than Basket One Amounts paid or payable for such taxable year and the four preceding taxable years over (II) the Escrow Threshold at such time.
(B) If New Ashland Inc. has a credit rating provided by Moody's or Standard & Poor (or successors thereto) at the relevant time, the Escrow Threshold at any time shall equal:

provided, however
 
(C)  If, at the time any Tax Benefit Payment for a taxable year is required to be made, New Ashland Inc. does not have a credit rating provided by Moody's or Standard & Poor (or successors thereto), New Ashland Inc. will obtain, at its own cost, from Moody's or Standard & Poor, or both, a pro forma credit rating and provide such rating to Marathon prior to the time of such Tax Benefit Payment.  Such rating will be updated at least annually.
 
(ii) In the circumstances described in Section 6.02(d)below.

Certain Changes in Escrow Threshold.
 
(e)    Except as provided in Section 6.02(d) above, any amounts placed in Escrow in respect of a Tax Benefit Payment for a taxable year shall be released from Escrow upon the fifth anniversary of the filing of the corporate income Tax Return for the Marathon Affiliated Group for such taxable year and shall be paid directly to New Ashland Inc.

(ii)  Marathon agrees that it shall, and shall cause each member of the Marathon Group to, prepare and file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Tax Ruling and the Tax Opinion, except as otherwise required by Article V or a Final Determination; , to the extent that the Tax Ruling and the Tax Opinion are inconsistent in any respect, such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed on a basis consistent with the Tax Ruling.

(iv)  Marathon agrees that, for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending two years after the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause each member of the Marathon Group not to, make any capital contribution of money or other property to MAP or any JV Entity (including any capital contribution pursuant to Article IV of the MAP LLC Agreement or any other provision of the MAP LLC Agreement) other than capital contributions (i) that are the result of, and in response to, Extraordinary Events; or (ii) if the Tax Ruling includes a ruling that the MAP Partial Redemption does not constitute a disguised sale, capital contributions for purposes specifically identified in the Tax Ruling or the Tax Ruling Request.
 
(v)  During the period beginning on October 1, 2004 (or, if earlier, the day before the Closing Date) and ending on the date two years after the Closing Date, Marathon shall cause MAP and its subsidiaries not to, and MAP and its subsidiaries shall not (A) incur any indebtedness owed to Marathon or any affiliate of Marathon or (B) incur any indebtedness under one or more revolving credit facilities, uncommitted money market credit facilities or other comparable debt facilities to the extent such indebtedness is guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by Marathon or any affiliate of Marathon (other than such an affiliate that is MAP or any wholly-owned subsidiary of MAP), except such Marathon guaranteed debt will be permissible if the Tax Ruling includes a ruling that the MAP Partial Redemption does not constitute a disguised sale and such ruling or the Tax Ruling Request contemplates debt guaranteed by Marathon.

receivables pursuant to the Receivables Sales Facility (as such term is defined in the MAP LLC Agreement).

If as a result of any change or modification to such accounting pronouncements between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Marathon concludes that it and MAP will not be able to treat such sales of receivables as sales for financial accounting purposes, it shall cause MAP to use its reasonable best efforts to modify the Receivables Sales Facility in order to achieve sale treatment for financial accounting purposes, if such modification can be made in a manner that is (i) acceptable to Marathon from a tax point of view and otherwise reasonably acceptable to Marathon, and (ii) acceptable to Ashland from a tax point of view.

The failure of Marathon to deliver such written notice shall constitute its agreement to the second sentence of this paragraph (vi) notwithstanding any such change in accounting pronouncements.  Marathon further agrees that if the relevant accounting pronouncements change after the Closing Date and, as a result of such changes, Marathon concludes that it and MAP will not be able to treat sales of receivables pursuant to the Receivables Sales Facility as sales for financial accounting purposes, Marathon shall cause MAP to modify the Receivables Sales Facility in order to achieve sale treatment for financial accounting purposes if it can do so at an insignificant cost (provided that such modification is acceptable to New Ashland Inc. from a tax point of view) or if New Ashland Inc. agrees to indemnify Marathon and MAP for any increased costs that result from such changes.

Calculation of Losses.
 
SECTION 8.02.    (a)    (i)  If a party (the "indemnified party") receives any written notice of deficiency, claim or adjustment or other written notice from a Tax Authority that may result in the indemnified party being entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving an audit proceeding, audit inquiry, information request, suit, action, contest or similar claim made by any Tax Authority (a "Tax Claim") such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Tax Claim within 10 business days after such indemnified party receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of the existence of the Tax Claim; , , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement, except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been materially and adversely prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(ii) If any party receives a written notice from a Tax Authority that may result in an adjustment in the amount of the Specified Liability Deductions for a taxable year as a result of an audit of the New Ashland Inc. Affiliated Group or the Marathon Affiliated Group, then for purposes of this TMA, such audit and related proceeding, to the extent they concern the amount of the Specified Liability Deductions claimed or capable of being claimed by Marathon or the Marathon Group as successor to HoldCo, shall be treated as a Tax Claim with respect to which Marathon is the indemnified party and New Ashland Inc. is the indemnifying party, , , that the resolution of such issues shall not

preclude Marathon from compromising or settling any other issues in its Tax Returns administratively with any Tax Authority and Marathon shall have the right to determine in its sole reasonable discretion the appropriate forum and location of any judicial proceeding with respect to Specified Liability Deductions.
 
(b)    Except as provided in Section 8.02(c) of this TMA, if a Tax Claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with professional advisors and counsel selected by the indemnifying party; , , that such professional advisors or counsel are not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party.  Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Tax Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any fees or expenses relating to such professional advisors or counsel subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof.  If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ professional advisors and counsel (not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the professional advisors and counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense.  The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of professional advisors and counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof.  If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Tax Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.  Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, cooperating and assisting in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.  Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Tax Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Tax Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent.  If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Tax Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise, or discharge of a Tax Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Tax Claim; if such settlement, compromise or discharge imposes conditions, costs or other detriments (in addition to the liability in connection with such Tax Claim) upon the indemnified party, such indemnified party may use its reasonable judgment in determining whether to so agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.
Assumption.

provided that
 
(c)    If a party to this TMA suffers a Bankruptcy Event, then the party suffering the Bankruptcy Event (the "Bankruptcy Party") shall vigorously pursue the assertion, or defense (as the case may be) of all Tax Claims for which any other party to this TMA (the "Non-Bankruptcy Party") might be jointly and severally, directly or indirectly liable ("Bankruptcy Tax Claims") and the Non-Bankruptcy Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Bankruptcy
Joint rights and assumption of control.
Tax Claims and to employ professional advisors and counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Bankruptcy Party), at its own expense, separate from the professional advisors and counsel employed by the Bankruptcy Party, it being understood that the Bankruptcy Party shall control the defense of such claims.  Both parties shall in good faith cooperate with one another and the Bankruptcy Party shall not unreasonably reject any suggestions made by the Non-Bankruptcy Party.  Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Non-Bankruptcy Party's request) the provision to the Non-Bankruptcy Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Bankruptcy Tax Claims (including copies of all protests, pleadings, briefs, filings, correspondence and similar materials relative to such claims), making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, cooperating and assisting in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters, and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.  The preceding sentences of this Section 8.02(c) notwithstanding, if the Bankruptcy Party fails to vigorously pursue such Bankruptcy Tax Claims, or such Bankruptcy Party is discharged, or otherwise effectively barred from liability for such Bankruptcy Tax Claims, the Non-Bankruptcy Party shall have the right to assume full control over the defense of such Bankruptcy Tax Claims and, if such control is assumed, the Bankruptcy Party shall irrevocably designate, and agree to cause each of its affiliates to designate irrevocably, the Non-Bankruptcy Party as the sole and exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to take any action as such Non-Bankruptcy Party may deem appropriate, necessary, or incidental in any and all matters relating to Pre-Closing Period Tax Claims of the Ashland Group and the Bankruptcy Party shall continue to cooperate fully in the defense or prosecution thereof, but it shall not have the right to participate in the proceedings.
 
(d)    New Ashland Inc. and Marathon shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability, which shall include claiming any indemnified loss as a deduction or offset on any relevant Tax Return (including any amended Tax Return).  In the event that New Ashland Inc. or Marathon shall fail to make such reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any person for any indemnified loss that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if New Ashland Inc. or Marathon, as the case may be, had made such efforts.
Mitigation.
 
SECTION 8.03.    The parties agree that any indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to Article XIII of the Master Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as distributions or capital contributions, as the case may be, between HoldCo and New Ashland Inc. made immediately prior to the Spinoff and, accordingly, not as taxable income to the recipient or as a deductible expense to the payor, unless otherwise required by a Final Determination.
Treatment of Indemnification Payments.
 
SECTION 9.01.    In the event that Marathon or any member of the Marathon Group, as the case may be, on the one hand, and New Ashland Inc. or any member of the New Ashland Inc. Group, as the case may be, on the other hand, disagree as to the amount or calculation of any payment to be made under this TMA, or the interpretation or application of any provision under this TMA, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute.  If such dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) business days following the commencement of the dispute, Marathon and New Ashland Inc. shall jointly retain a tax attorney who has retired from active practice in a nationally recognized law firm or independent public accounting firm, which firm is independent of both parties, or a retired Federal judge experienced in Tax Matters (the "Independent Entity"), to resolve the dispute.  If the parties are unable to agree on an Independent Entity, then each party shall appoint a person who would qualify as an Independent Entity (but for the approval of the other party), and such persons shall then appoint a person who meets the above description as the Independent Entity and who shall serve as the Independent Entity.  The Independent Entity shall act as an arbitrator to resolve all points of disagreement and its decision shall be final and binding upon all parties involved.  Following the decision of the Independent Entity, Marathon, and members of the Marathon Group, and New Ashland Inc. and members of the New Ashland Inc. Group shall each take or cause to be taken any action necessary to implement the decision of the Independent Entity.  The fees and expenses relating to the Independent Entity shall be borne equally by Marathon and New Ashland Inc.
Dispute Resolution.
 
SECTION 9.02.    Any payment required to be made under this TMA that is not made on or before the date on which such payment is due shall bear interest computed at the rate specified from time to time pursuant to Code Section 6621(a)(2).
Interest.
 
 
SECTION 10.01.    This Agreement shall terminate simultaneous with any termination of the Master Agreement pursuant to Article XI thereof.  In the event of termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto.
Termination.
 
SECTION 10.02.    Notwithstanding anything in this TMA to the contrary apart from Section 10.01, the provisions of this TMA shall survive for 30 days after the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) unless by their term they expire at an earlier date.
Survival.
SECTION 10.03.    Either party may set-off any amount to which it is entitled under this TMA against amounts otherwise payable hereunder by such party.  Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election of remedies or limit such party in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.
Right of Set-off.
 
SECTION 10.04.    All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon receipt by the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):
Notices.
 
 
SECTION 10.05.    When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation".  This Agreement is intended to calculate, allocate and assign certain Tax responsibilities, liabilities and benefits among the parties to this Agreement, and any situation or circumstance concerning such calculation, allocation and assignment that is not specifically contemplated hereby or provided for herein shall be determined in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of calculation, allocation and assignment in this Agreement.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

To the extent any provision of this TMA conflicts with the determination of the Tax Liability (as defined in the MAP LLC Agreement) of Ashland or its successors for any Straddle Period of MAP as determined under Section 10.03 of the MAP LLC Agreement, such Tax Liability shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement.  In all other respects, except as expressly modified herein, the terms and conditions of the MAP LLC Agreement, the ATCA, and the Put/Call Agreement shall continue to apply to the extent provided in Article XII of the Master Agreement.

Any Tax Claim with respect to any issue concerning MAP's income, gain, losses, deductions or credits that could result in additional Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period for Ashland and additional basis (other than additional basis that is subject to Section 4.03 of the TMA) or deductions in the Post-Closing Period for Marathon or any member of the Marathon Group shall be treated under Section 6.08(e)(ii) of the MAP LLC Agreement as an issue the tax effect of which, if resolved adversely would be, and the tax effect of settling the issue is, proportionately the same for both Members.  If an issue is treated as not proportionately the same for both Members under the preceding sentence, then in applying Section 6.08(e)(iv) of the MAP LLC Agreement, nationally recognized tax counsel (whose selection shall be based on the principles of Section 9.01 of the TMA) shall determine if the settlement is fair to both Members based on the merits of the issue.  Such fees of the nationally recognized tax counsel shall be shared, 62% by Marathon and 38% by New Ashland Inc.
