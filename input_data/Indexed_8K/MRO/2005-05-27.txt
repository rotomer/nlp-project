The pre-established measures used for determining the vested shares were as follows:
 
Net income from operations per barrel of oil equivalent competitive comparison
 - 
                 
Oil and gas reserve replacement ratio
 - 
                 
Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation as a percent of total assets
 - 
                 
Safety performance
 - 
                 
Adjusted operating income per barrel of crude oil throughput competitive comparison
 - 
                 
 
 
Grants of Long-Term Incentive Awards under the 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan
 
The Committee also approved grants of long-term incentive awards for the following named executive officers in the form of stock options, restricted stock, and performance units, as follows:
 
The stock options have a grant price per share of $47.65 and will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.  The restricted stock will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the named executive officer's continuous employment with the Company.  The performance units have a target value of $1.00 each and will vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on the Company's total shareholder return as compared to peer group performance.
 
Complete descriptions of the terms and conditions applicable to these long-term incentive awards are set forth in the respective award agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
