Top of the Form

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) today is providing information on market factors and operating conditions which occurred during the first quarter 2006 that could impact the Company's quarterly financial results. The market indicators and Company estimates noted below and in the attached schedule may differ significantly from the actual first quarter results. The Company will report actual first quarter results on April 27, 2006. Details concerning the Company's earnings conference call and webcast are noted at the end of this release.
HOUSTON, April 6, 2006 
Exploration and Production
Production sold during the first quarter is estimated to be between 365,000 and 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). Revenues are reported based on production sold during the period and can vary from production available for sale primarily as a result of the timing of international crude oil liftings. Oil and natural gas production available for sale during the first quarter is expected to be approximately 415,000 boepd, exceeding the previous guidance of 395,000 to 410,000. During the first quarter of 2006, approximately half of the difference between the available for sale and production sold volumes are a result of underlifted quantities associated with Libya, with the remainder from Equatorial Guinea and the United Kingdom.
As shown in the attached table, crude oil and natural gas market price indicators have remained strong during the first quarter. For the months of January and February 2006, Marathon's worldwide crude oil realizations were slightly higher than those realized during the fourth quarter 2005. U.S. natural gas realizations for January and February 2006 were $1.25 per million cubic feet less than those realized in the fourth quarter 2005, while international natural gas realizations for these two months were relatively flat with the fourth quarter 2005. Marathon's actual crude oil and natural gas price realizations vary from market indicators primarily due to product quality and location differentials.
Estimated first quarter exploration expense is expected to remain unchanged from previous guidance of between $70 and $95 million. U.S. exploration expense is estimated to be between $35 and $50 million, while international exploration expense is estimated to be $35 to $45 million.
Refining, Marketing and Transportation
Market indicators for refining margins (crack spreads) in the Midwest (Chicago) and Gulf Coast were relatively strong during the first quarter 2006 when compared with the first quarter 2005. As a result of these relatively strong margins and favorable sweet/sour differentials, the Company estimates its refining and wholesale marketing margin per gallon will be higher than reported for the first quarter 2005.
Crude oil refined during January and February 2006 averaged 842,000 barrels per day (bpd). The Company estimates crude runs for the quarter will average approximately 895,000 bpd, slightly lower than during the first quarter 2005. However, total refinery throughputs for the first quarter 2006 are expected to be somewhat higher than the 1,094,000 bpd during the first quarter 2005. Speedway SuperAmerica LLC's gasoline and distillate gross margin averaged approximately 10 cents per gallon during January and February of 2006 and is also expected to be about 10 cents per gallon for the first quarter 2006, slightly lower than that realized in the first quarter 2005 and below the 14 cents per gallon realized during the fourth quarter 2005.
Unallocated Administrative Expense
Total administrative expense for the quarter is expected to be approximately $85 to $95 million. The estimated increase in administrative expense, over the previous projection of $60 to $65 million, is primarily a result of accruals for equity based compensation, largely due to a more than $15 per share increase in the price of Marathon's common stock during the quarter.
Earnings Release Date and Conference Call Information
Marathon will report its first quarter 2006 results on April 27, 2006. The Company will also conduct a conference call and webcast that same day at 2 p.m. EDT.
