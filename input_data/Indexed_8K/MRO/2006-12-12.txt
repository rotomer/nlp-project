Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) announced today that it has submitted a request to NYSE Arca, Inc., formerly the Pacific Stock Exchange ("NYSE Arca"), to voluntarily withdraw the listing of its common stock. Marathon's common stock will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange.
HOUSTON, December 12, 2006 
Marathon's decision to voluntarily withdraw its listing from NYSE Arca was made to eliminate duplicative administrative requirements inherent with dual listings as a result of the NYSE Group's recent merger with Archipelago Holdings, the parent company of NYSE Arca.
