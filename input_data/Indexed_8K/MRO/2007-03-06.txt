Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 28, 2007, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the design of the 2007 annual incentive bonus program for the named executive officers. Under the program, each officer will be eligible to receive an incentive compensation bonus for 2007, up to a specified maximum, if the Company achieves the specified target level of performance for one or more of three corporate performance metrics. If one or more of the corporate performance metrics is achieved, the Compensation Committee will exercise its discretion to award each named executive officer a bonus for 2007, up to the specified maximum. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee will consider the Companys performance relative to two specific upstream performance metrics and two specific downstream performance metrics. In addition, the Compensation Committee will consider each individual officers performance when awarding their respective bonuses for 2007.
