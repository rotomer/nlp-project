Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 30, 2007, Marathon Oil Corporation ("Marathon") entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the "Agreement"), by and among Marathon, 1339971 Alberta Ltd., Western Oil Sands Inc. ("Western") and WesternZagros Resources Inc. ("WesternZagros"), pursuant to which Marathon agreed to acquire Western. Under the terms of the Agreement, Western shareholders will receive cash of approximately $3.8 billion Canadian dollars ("CDN") and 34.3 million Marathon common shares or securities exchangeable for Marathon common shares. Marathon will also assume Westerns debt at closing. Marathons Board of Directors and Westerns Board of Directors have approved the Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Western shareholders who are residents of Canada for tax purposes will have the option to elect cash, Marathon common stock, exchangeable shares, or a combination thereof. Western shareholders who are not residents of Canada for tax purposes will have the option to elect cash or Mar athon common stock, or a combination thereof. Cash dividends will not be paid on the exchangeable shares. Holders of exchangeable shares will have the right to receive additional Marathon common stock to account for the cash dividends declared on Marathon common stock on an economically equivalent basis and the option to exchange their shares for Marathon common stock. The exchangeable shares are subject to redemption by Marathon four years after closing and in certain other limited circumstances. The Agreement requires Western to spin off WesternZagros, its wholly owned-subsidiary, prior to closing. The Agreement also contains non-solicitation and termination provisions and provides for Western to pay Marathon a termination fee of CDN$200 million under certain circumstances. The completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, (1) the approval of the acquisition by Western shareholders and (2) applicable regulatory and court approvals. The Agreement is filed pursuant to Item 9.01 as Exhibit 10.1 hereto . The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

A former holder of Class A Shares who (i) has exchanged Class A Shares under the Arrangement; and (ii) has received Exchangeable Shares in whole or in part under the exchange; shall be entitled to make an income tax election, pursuant to subsection 85(1) or 85(2) of the ITA, as applicable (and the analogous provisions of provincial income tax law) with respect to the transfer by the holder of Class A Shares, as applicable, to AcquisitionCo by providing two signed copies of the necessary election forms to Western within 120 days following the Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the number of shares transferred and the applicable agreed amounts for the purposes of such elections. Thereafter, subject to the election forms complying with the provisions of the ITA (or applicable provincial income tax law), the forms will be signed by AcquisitionCo and returned to such former holders of Class A Shares within 30 days after the receipt thereof by Western for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable provincial taxing authority). AcquisitionCo and Western will not be responsible for the proper completion of any election form and, except for the obligation of AcquisitionCo and Western to so sign and return duly completed election forms which are received by Western within 120 days of the Effective Date, AcquisitionCo and Western will not be responsible for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the failure by a former holder of Class A Shares to properly complete or file the election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable provincial legislation). In its sole discretion, AcquisitionCo and Western may choose to sign and return an election form received by it more than 120 days following the Effective Date, but AcquisitionCo and Western will have no obligation to do so.
3.05
Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Common Shares, Marathon Shares or Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon or the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such other portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.
3.06
Each registered holder of Common Shares shall have the right to dissent with respect to the Arrangement in accordance with the Interim Order. A Dissenting Shareholder shall, on the Effective Date, cease to have any rights as a holder of Common Shares and shall only be entitled to be paid the fair value of the holder's Common Shares. A Dissenting Shareholder who is paid the fair value of the holder's Common Shares shall be deemed to have transferred the holder's Common Shares to Western for cancellation on the Effective Date, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA. A Dissenting Shareholder who for any reason is not entitled to be paid the fair value of the holder's Common Shares shall be treated as if the holder had participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Common Shares and shall be deemed to have elected to receive for such holder's Shares the consideration specified in Section 3.02(d), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA. The fair value of the Common Shares shall be determined as of the close of business on the last business day before the day on which the Arrangement is approved by the holders of Common Shares at the Meeting; but in no event shall Western be required to recognize such Dissenting Shareholder as a shareholder of Western after the Effective Time and the names of such holders shall be removed from the applicable register of shareholders as at the Effective Time. For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in Section 191 of the ABCA, any person who has voted in favour of the Arrangement shall not be entitled to dissent with respect to the Arrangement.
4.01
From and after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing Common Shares acquired by AcquisitionCo under the Arrangement shall represent only the right to receive the consideration to which the holders are entitled under the Arrangement, or as to those held by Dissenting Shareholders, other than those Dissenting Shareholders deemed to have participated in the Arrangement pursuant to Section 4.01, to receive the fair value of the Common Shares represented by such certificates.
5.01
Western, AcquisitionCo and SpinCo, as applicable, shall, as soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Date and the date of deposit by a former holder of Common Shares acquired by AcquisitionCo under the Arrangement of a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form and the certificates representing such Common Shares, either:
5.02
the Cash Consideration and certificates representing the number of SpinCo Shares, SpinCo Warrants, Marathon Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares, as applicable, issued to such holder under the Arrangement.
If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an interest in outstanding Common Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 3.01 has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration to which the holder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement (and any dividends with respect thereto) as determined in accordance with the Arrangement. The person who is entitled to receive such consideration shall as a condition precedent to the receipt thereof give a bond satisfactory to Western and its transfer agent in such form as is satisfactory to Western and such transfer agent or otherwise indemnify Western, Marathon and AcquisitionCo and the transfer agent, to the reasonable satisfaction of such parties, against any claim that may be made against any of them with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
5.03
All dividends payable with respect to any Marathon Shares, Exchangeable Shares and SpinCo Shares allotted and issued pursuant to this Arrangement for which a certificate has not been issued shall be paid or delivered to the Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust for the registered holder thereof. All monies received by the Depositary shall be invested by it in interest-bearing trust accounts upon such terms as the Depositary may reasonably deem appropriate. The Depositary shall pay and deliver to any such registered holder, as soon as reasonably practicable after application therefor is made by the registered holder to the Depositary in such form as the Depositary may reasonably require, such distributions and any interest thereon to which such holder, is entitled, net of applicable withholding and other taxes.
5.04
Any certificate formerly representing Common Shares that is not deposited with all other documents as required by this Plan of Arrangement on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of the holder of such Common Shares to receive the certificates representing: (i) the SpinCo Shares; (ii) SpinCo Warrants; (iii) Marathon Shares; (iv) Exchangeable Shares; and/or (v) cash.
5.05
No certificates representing fractional Marathon Shares, Exchangeable Shares, SpinCo Shares or SpinCo Warrants shall be issued upon the exchange of the Common Shares for Marathon Shares or Exchangeable Shares or the distribution of SpinCo Shares and SpinCo Warrants. In lieu of any fractional Marathon Share, Exchangeable Share, SpinCo Share or SpinCo Warrant, each registered Common Shareholder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in a Marathon Share, Exchangeable Share, SpinCo Share or SpinCo Warrant will receive the nearest whole number of Marathon Shares, Exchangeable Shares, SpinCo Shares or SpinCo Warrants, as the case may be.
5.06
Western, WesternZagros, Marathon and AcquisitionCo may amend, modify and/or supplement this Plan of Arrangement at any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, provided that each such amendment, modification and/or supplement must be (i) set out in writing, (ii) approved by the other parties, (iii) filed with the Court and, if made following the Meeting, approved by the Court, and (iv) communicated to holders of Common Shares, if and as required by the Court.
6.01
Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be proposed by Western, WesternZagros, Marathon or AcquisitionCo at any time prior to or at the Meeting (provided that the other parties shall have consented thereto) with or without any other prior notice or communication, and if so proposed and accepted by the persons voting at the Meeting (other than as may be required under the Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan of Arrangement for all purposes.
6.02
Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement that is approved by the Court following the Meeting shall be effective only if it is consented to by each of Western, WesternZagros, Marathon and AcquisitionCo.
6.03
Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be made following the Effective Time unilaterally by Western, provided that it concerns a matter which, in the reasonable opinion of Western, is of an administrative nature required to better give effect to the implementation of this Plan of Arrangement and is not adverse to the financial or economic interests of Western or any former holder of Common Shares.
