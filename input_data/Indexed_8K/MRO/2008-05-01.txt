Exhibit 99.1
 
, May 1, 2008 
HOUSTON
Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) today reported first quarter 2008 net income of $731 million, or $1.02 per diluted share.  Net income in the first quarter of 2007 was $717 million, or $1.03 per diluted share.  For the first quarter of 2008, net income adjusted for special items was $767 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to net income adjusted for special items of $707 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2007.
 
 
 
 
Despite a very challenging downstream environment, our business overall generated very solid financial results for the first quarter, with increased adjusted net income over both the first and fourth quarters of 2007, said
Clarence P. Cazalot, Jr., Marathon president and CEO.
 
Our upstream and integrated gas segments had strong operating performance and benefited as well from higher overall hydrocarbon prices.  Upstream sales volumes were up 11.5 percent on a year-on-year basis and 6.8 percent quarter over quarter, while our LNG facility in Equatorial Guinea performed at near full capacity.
 
Downstream results were adversely impacted by lower overall margins as a result of rapidly rising crude oil prices as well as the substantial amount of planned maintenance we performed at two of our largest refineries in the first quarter, Cazalot added.
 
 
Segment Results
 
Total segment income was $735 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $749 million in the first quarter of 2007.

Exploration and Production
 
Exploration and Production segment income totaled $684 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $385 million in the first quarter of 2007, primarily as a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations, partially offset by higher exploration expenses.  Sales volumes during the quarter averaged 378,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and production available for sale averaged 375,000 boepd.
 
United States upstream income was $244 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $150 million in the first quarter of 2007, primarily as a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realizations, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher exploration expenses.
 
International upstream income was $440 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $235 million in the first quarter of 2007, primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations, partially offset by increased exploration expenses.  Included in the first quarter 2008 exploration expense were costs related to the acquisition of seismic data in Indonesia and to the evaluation of Canadian in-situ oil sand leases.  
The increase in Equatorial Guinea natural gas sales volumes due to the start-up of the EG LNG Train 1 production facility in the second quarter of 2
007 contributed to the decline in the average natural gas realization for the first quarter of 2008.
 
 
Final project commissioning continues on the Alvheim/Vilje development in Norway.  Marathon has a 65 percent operated interest in the Alvheim fields and a 47 percent outside-operated interest in the Vilje field.  It is expected that a combined peak net production rate of 75,000 boepd will be reached in early 2009.

During the first quarter, Marathon was the high bidder on 15 blocks offered in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale No. 206 conducted by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). These high bids total $121 million net to the Company. Two blocks are 100 percent Marathon, and the remaining blocks were bid with partners.  Initial drilling on these leases, and those acquired at Lease Sale No. 205 in October 2007, is planned for 2009.
 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, Marathon drilled a successful appraisal well on the Droshky discovery and participated in the successful Stones appraisal well.  The Droshky appraisal well is located on Green Canyon Block 244 in about 2,900 feet of water.  The initial appraisal well successfully defined the limits of the discovery and encountered some additional deeper pay intervals.  The appraisal well was then sidetracked to help assess reservoir connectivity and gather core and fluid information.  The well has been cased for future completion/production.  Marathon owns a 100 percent working interest in the Droshky discovery.  The Stones appraisal well is located on Walker Ridge Block 508 approximately 200 miles from New Orleans.  This discovery encountered multiple hydrocarbon-bearing sands in the Lower Tertiary interval.  Future drilling activity is currently being planned to further define the size and help determine the potential commerciality of this discovery.  Marathon holds a 25 percent outside-operated interest in Stones.
 
Offshore Angola, Marathon participated in the Portia discovery on Block 31.  Portia is Marathons 27 discovery on Blocks 31 and 32. It was drilled in a water depth of about 6,500 feet and reached a total depth of about 18,600 feet. The well test results confirmed the capability of the reservoir to flow more than 5,000 barrels per day. Marathon is currently participating in a well on Block 31 and a well on Block 32.  Also, Marathon has participated in three additional deepwater Angola exploration/appraisal wells that have reached total depth. The results of these wells will be disclosed upon receipt of government and partner approvals.  Marathon holds a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32.

Oil Sands Mining
 
The Oil Sands Mining segment reported income of $27 million for the first quarter of 2008.  This includes a $36 million after-tax loss, of which $32 million was unrealized, on derivative instruments.  These derivatives were put in place by Western Oil Sands Inc. prior to its acquisition by Marathon in October 2007 to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude oil.
 
Marathons first quarter 2008 net bitumen production before royalties from the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) mining operation was 24,000 barrels per day (bpd), which was lower than expected due to weather-related issues at the mine and unplanned maintenance at the Scotford upgrader.
 
 
 
The AOSP Phase 1 Expansion  which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing
Muskeg
 
River
mine, expansion of the Scotford upgrader, and development of related infrastructure  is anticipated to begin operations in late 2010.
 
 
Marathon Oil Corporation Reports First Quarter 2008 Financial Results page 3
 
 
During the first quarter, the royalty calculation methodology for the AOSP was revised to allow for additional eligible costs of the project.  As a result, the project reverted to the one percent gross royalty (in lieu of the 25 percent post-recovery rate) as of July 1, 2007.  Marathon expects a royalty refund of $32 million, of which $16 million was included in income for the first quarter of 2008 and $16 million reduced the goodwill recorded at the acquisition date since it related to pre-acquisition activities.
 
 
Refining, Marketing and Transportation
 
The Refining, Marketing and Transportation segment reported a loss of $75 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to segment income of $345 million in the first quarter of 2007, rimarily a result of the lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margin.
with the decrease p
 
The refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon was negative 0.26 cents in the first quarter of 2008, compared to a positive 12.46 cents in the first quarter of 2007. The primary factor contributing to this decrease was the decline in the relevant market  indicators [Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) 6-3-2-1 crack spreads] in the Midwest (Chicago) and Gulf Coast markets. Furthermore, the decline in Marathons refining and wholesale marketing gross margin was greater than that of the market indicators because the Companys wholesale price realizations for non-gasoline and non-distillate products did not increase over the comparable prior-year period as much as the average spot market price for the applicable product used in the market indicators.
 
Marathons refining and wholesale marketing gross margin for the first quarter of 2008 was further reduced by higher manufacturing costs, primarily resulting from increased planned maintenance at the Detroit, Garyville, La. and Robinson, Ill. refineries.  Primarily as a result of the increase in Marathons planned maintenance activities, crude oil refined during the first quarter of 2008 averaged 845,000 bpd, a 123,000 bpd decrease from the first quarter of 2007.  Total refinery throughputs were 1,079,000 bpd for the first quarter of 2008, 10 percent lower than the 1,195,000 bpd during the first quarter of 2007. Partially offsetting these negative factors was the improvement in the spread between gasoline and ethanol prices during the first quarter of 2008, compared to the first quarter of 2007.
 
Marathons refining and wholesale marketing gross margins included pretax derivatives losses of $120 million for the first quarter of 2008 and gains of $27 million for first quarter of 2007.  The derivative changes reflect both the realized effects of closed derivative positions as well as unrealized effects as a result of marking open derivative positions to market.  Most derivatives have an underlying physical commodity transaction; however, the income effect related to the derivatives and the income effect related to the underlying physical transactions may not necessarily be recognized in net income in the same period

Integrated Gas
 
Integrated Gas segment income was $99 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $19 million in the first quarter of 2007.  The increase was primarily related to income from the Equatorial Guinea LNG production facility which commenced operations in May 2007.  The operational availability of the facility was 93 percent in the first quarter of 2008. The production facility, in which Marathon holds a 60 percent interest, delivered 15 cargoes during the first quarter of 2008. Income from Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC was $4 million higher in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007.  Higher realized methanol prices offset the impact of a sales volume decrease that resulted from a planned shut-down to repair the reformer and to install a new compressor.  Spending for Gas-to-Fuels and other natural gas commercialization technologies in the first quarter of 2008 was $16 million compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2007.

Corporate
 
Marathon has certain deferred income tax balances denominated in foreign currencies.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause the U.S. dollar value of these deferred tax balances to change with the related currency gains and losses reflected in the provision for income taxes.  For the first quarter of 2008, Marathons provision for income taxes included a $49 million foreign currency gain primarily related to its deferred income tax balance in Canada.  Marathon does not allocate foreign currency gains or losses to segments.
 
Marathon continued its share repurchase program during the first quarter, repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $143 million.  Since January 2006, Marathons Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Marathons common stock.  As of the end of the first quarter, just under $2.7 billion in Marathon shares had been repurchased.

Special Items
 
Marathon has two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the United Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Mark-to-market changes in the valuation of these contracts must be recognized in current period income.  In the first quarter of 2008, the non-cash after-tax mark-to-market loss on these contracts related to Marathons Brae natural gas production totaled $36 million.  Due to the volatility in the fair value of these contracts, Marathon consistently excludes these non-cash gains and losses from net income adjusted for special items.
 
The Company will conduct a conference call and webcast today, May 1, at 2 p.m. EDT during which it will discuss first quarter results.  The webcast will include synchronized slides.  To listen to the webcast of the conference call and view the slides, visit the Marathon Web site at www.Marathon.com.  Replays of the webcast will be available through May 15, 2008.  Quarterly financial and operational information is also provided on
Marathon
s Web site at http://ir.marathon.com in the Quarterly Investor Packet.
 
 
In addition to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Marathon has provided supplementally net income adjusted for special items, a non-GAAP financial measure which facilitates comparisons to earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties.  Such forecasts generally exclude the effects of items that are considered non-recurring, are difficult to predict or to measure in advance or that are not directly related to Marathon's ongoing operations.  A reconciliation between GAAP net income and net income adjusted for special items is provided in a table on page 1 of this release.  Net income adjusted for special items should not be considered a substitute for net income as reported in accordance with GAAP.  Management, as well as certain investors, uses net income adjusted for special items to evaluate Marathon's financial performance between periods.  Management also uses net income adjusted for special items to compare Marathon's performance to certain competitors.
 
Unlike capital expenditures reported under generally accepted accounting principles, the projected costs for the Garyville refinery expansion project and the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project discussed in this release do not include capitalized interest.  Capitalized interest is budgeted at the corporate level.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to the Alvheim/Vilje development, the Droshky prospect, potential developments in Angola, anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, the AOSP expansion, the Garyville refinery expansion project, the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, and the common stock repurchase program. Some factors that could potentially affect the Alvheim/Vilje development, the Droshky prospect, potential developments in Angola, anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations.  Except for the Alvheim/Vilje development, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability or delay in obtaining government and third-party approvals and permits.  Factors that could affect the AOSP expansion, the Garyville refinery expansion and the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.  The common stock repurchase program could be affected by changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of the Companys production or refining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions or acts of war or terrorist acts, and other operating and economic considerations. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. In accordance with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon
Oil Corporation has included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying other important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
