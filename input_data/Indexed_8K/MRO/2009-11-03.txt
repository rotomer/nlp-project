For the third quarter 2009, adjusted net income was $436 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $1.963 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008.
HOUSTON, Nov. 3, 2009
Marathon Oil Corporation
 
 
 
Marathon's strong and balanced portfolio of businesses performed well in the third quarter, despite ongoing uncertainties throughout the global economy, said Clarence P. Cazalot, Jr., president and CEO of Marathon. In our Exploration and Production segment, production available for sale rose 5 percent from the year-ago quarter, and the Company made progress on development projects in Norway, the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. Our Refining, Marketing and Transportation segment once again out-performed its peers in the domestic market that saw significantly lower gross margins versus a year ago. Another bright spot was our Speedway SuperAmerica LLC business, which recorded higher same-store gasoline sales volumes and merchandise sales in the third quarter of 2009 from the year-ago period. The Garyville Major Expansion project is nearing completion, and we look forward to an on-schedule startup by year's end.

Segment Results
 
Total segment income was $687 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $1.993 billion in the third quarter of 2008.
 
 
Exploration and Production
 
Exploration and Production (E&P) segment income totaled $491 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $869 million in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
 
Reflecting Marathons continued focus on controlling costs, the Company achieved a 10 percent reduction in operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) for the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, excluding production taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A).
 
Third quarter 2009 sales volumes, which exclude the Companys Gabonese operations now reported as discontinued operations, averaged 366,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). Production available for sale was up 5 percent to 393,000 boepd from 375,000 boepd in the same quarter of 2008. The primary difference between recorded sales volumes and production volumes available for sale is due to the timing of international oil liftings.
 
For the first nine months of 2009, production available for sale from continuing operations averaged 405,000 boepd, up 11 percent compared to 365,000 boepd in the same period last year. Production increases for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year were primarily a result of Alvheim/Vilje in Norwa, which started production in mid-2008.
 
 
Including production from Gabon, as it was in the Companys interim guidance, total volumes available for sale were 399,000 boepd in the third quarter 2009, at the top end of the Companys previous guidance of 380,000 to 400,000 boepd. For the first nine months of 2009, total volumes available for sale were 413,000 boepd, a 9 percent increase over the same period in 2008. The Company has narrowed its full year 2009 projection for production available for sale to be between 405,000 and 410,000 boepd, from its previous guidance of 390,000 to 410,000 boepd. Both the current and the previous guidance include almost 6,000 boepd of production from Gabon, now reported as a discontinued operation.
 
International E&P income was $459 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $584 million in the third quarter of 2008. While international volumes were up, the decrease in income was primarily the result of lower price realizations  42 percent lower for liquid hydrocarbons and 55 percent lower for natural gas. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating and exploration costs. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2009, the Company began to credit certain foreign taxes that were previously deducted. Partially offsetting

 this positive effect was a valuation allowance recorded on certain deferred tax assets that the Company does not expect to realize.
 
U.S. E&P reported income of $32 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to income of $285 million in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of lower price realizations  43 percent lower for liquid hydrocarbons and 53 percent lower for natural gas  partially offset by reduced operating costs due to lower ad valorem and severance taxes. Additionally, exploration expenses decreased $45 million from the same period of 2008.
 
During the quarter, Marathon announced with its partners that the Volund development off the coast of Norway achieved first production ahead of schedule, marking completion of Marathons next major field development project in Norway, which complements the Alvheim/Vilje developments. Due to the exceptional utilization of the Alvheim floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, the first Volund well is functioning as a swing producer until there is some natural decline in the Alvheim fields. The Volund field is expected to reach peak oil production of approximately 25,000 bpd (16,000 bpd net to Marathon), the timing of which is subject to available processing capacity on the Alvheim FPSO. Marathon holds a 65 percent working interest in Volund and serves as operator.
 
Also in Norway, Marathon and its partners announced the Marihone discovery, which is the first of several prospects near the Alvheim FPSO with tieback potential. The Marihone oil discovery is located in license PL340, about 12 miles south of the Volund and Alvheim fields. Marathon holds a 65 percent working interest in Marihone and serves as operator.
 
The Company also announced the deepwater Tebe discovery well on Block 31 offshore Angola. The well test results confirmed a flow rate in excess of 5,000 bpd. Marathon holds a 10 percent outside-operated working interest in Block 31.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Company continued to make progress on well completions for its Droshky development on Green Canyon Block 244. Work is under way to install flowlines that will tie back the Droshky wells to the third-party operated Bullwinkle platform. First production from Droshky, in which Marathon holds a 100 percent operated working interest, is targeted for mid-2010.
 
Marathon currently has three rigs running in its Bakken program with plans to add a fourth rig late in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net production at the end of the third quarter amounted to approximately 11,000

boepd, compared to 7,300 boepd at the end of the third quarter 2008. Marathons total Bakken leasehold in North Dakota is approximately 335,000 net acres.
 
As part of the Company's targeted expansion into key North America resource plays, Marathon spud its first well in the Marcellus Shale play in West Virginia during the third quarter of 2009. The Company plans to spud three additional wells in the Marcellus play by the end of the year. In the Marcellus play, Marathon currently holds approximately 70,000 net acres in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
 
 
Oil Sands Mining
 
 
Oil Sands Mining (OSM) segment income was $25 million for the third quarter of 2009 compared to $288 million in the third quarter of 2008 that included a $190 million after-tax gain on derivative instruments. Income was adversely affected by a 45 percent decrease in average synthetic crude oil realizations, partially offset by lower blendstock and energy costs.
 
           Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments.
(a)
 
The Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) Expansion 1 is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011. The AOSP Expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, expansion of the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure.
 
In October, the Government of Canada and Government of Alberta jointly announced their intent to partially fund AOSPs Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project. Under the terms of their Letters of Intent, the Government of Alberta would contribute CAD$745 million and the Government of Canada would provide CAD$120 million toward the projects development. A final investment decision on the Quest CCS project will be made at a later date, and is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies, as well as a final joint venture partner agreement. Marathon has a 20 percent interest in AOSP along with partners Shell Canada (60 percent and operator) and Chevron Canada Limited (20 percent).
 
 
Refining, Marketing and Transportation
 
Refining, Marketing and Transportation (RM&T) segment income was $158 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $771 million in the third quarter of 2008. The third quarter 2009 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin of decreased to 7.62 cents per gallon from 25.19 cents in the third quarter of 2008. The gross margin decline was consistent with the declines in crack spreads as reflected in the relevant market indicators [Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) 6-3-2-1 crack spreads] in the Midwest (Chicago) and Gulf Coast, and the substantial reduction in the sweet-sour differential. Marathons third quarter 2009 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin included a pretax derivative loss of $17 million. The third quarter 2008 gross margin included pretax derivative gains of $156 million.

Crude oil refined during the third quarter of 2009 averaged 1,019,000 bpd, compared to 955,000 bpd in the third quarter of 2008, and total refinery throughputs were 1,190,000 bpd, approximately 4 percent higher than the 1,144,000 bpd in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Marathon's RM&T segment achieved operating costs reductions of approximately 9 percent for the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period 2008, excluding changes in crude and product purchases, depreciation, energy prices and other variable expenses.
 
 
Speedway SuperAmerica LLC (SSA) gasoline and distillate gross margin per gallon averaged 14 cents in the third quarter of 2009, compared to 16.9 cents in the third quarter of 2008. SSA third quarter 2009 same store gasoline sales volumes increased approximately 3 percent over the third quarter of 2008, while same store merchandise sales increased approximately 12 percent for the same period.
 
As of Oct. 31, the Garyville Major Expansion project was approximately 98 percent complete with an on-schedule startup expected late in the fourth quarter 2009. This expansion will increase the Garyville refinerys crude oil refining capacity by 180,000 bpd, improving scale efficiencies and feedstock flexibility. In early January 2010, Marathon plans to commence an extended turnaround at the existing 256,000 bpd base refinery in Garyville. The entire facility (existing base and expansion) is expected to reach full refining capacity by the second quarter of 2010.
 
 
Integrated Gas
 
 
Integrated Gas segment income was $13 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $65 million in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) price realizations. The LNG sales contract in Equatorial Guinea has a Henry Hub basis so the approximately 67 percent decline in this index had a dramatic effect on LNG profitability. During the third quarter of 2009 the LNG plant was down 14 days for planned maintenance versus the original 18-day schedule, but higher plant reliability had a positive impact on year-over-year volumes. Marathon holds a 60 percent interest in the facility. Marathons methanol realizations were also down during the third quarter of 2009, in line with global methanol prices.

Corporate
 
 
Marathon has certain income tax balances denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause the U.S. dollar value of these tax balances to change with the related currency gains and losses reflected within the provision for income taxes. For the third quarter of 2009, Marathons provision for income taxes included a $114 million foreign currency remeasurement loss primarily related to its income tax balances in Canada, compared to a $76 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit in the same period of 2008.
 
Marathon expects the overall corporate effective income tax rate on adjusted pretax income to be between 54 and 59 percent for the full year 2009, excluding the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of tax balances. For the third quarter 2009, the effective income tax rate on adjusted pretax income was 47 percent, excluding the foreign currency remeasurement loss described above.
 
During the third quarter of 2009, Marathon entered into a definitive agreement with Perenco S.A., under which Perenco will purchase Marathons wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon Oil Gabon Limited, for $282 million excluding any purchase price adjustments at closing. The companies expect to close the transaction, subject to consultation with the Gabonese Government, during the fourth quarter of 2009 with an effective date of Jan. 1, 2009. Marathons net production available for sale from Gabon for the third quarter 2009 averaged approximately 6,000 boepd. With the pending transaction, Marathon plans to exit its existing Gabon business, and as discussed under the E&P segment results, the activities of this business have been presented as discontinued operations and excluded from E&P segment income for all periods presented.
 
Since launching its asset review and divestiture program in March 2008, Marathons announced asset sales, including the Gabon transaction, amount to approximately $3.5 billion in transaction values.
 
 
Special Items
 
Marathon had two natural gas sales contracts in the United Kingdom that were accounted for as derivative instruments. Mark-to-market changes in the valuation of these contracts were required to be recognized in earnings. In the third quarter of 2009, the non-cash after-tax mark-to-market loss on these contracts related to sales of natural gas from the Brae field complex totaled $7 million. Due to the volatility in the fair value of these contracts, Marathon has consistently excluded these non-cash gains and losses from adjusted net income. These contracts expired in September 2009.
 
Adjustments to the gains and losses on certain previously reported asset sales were recorded in the third quarter of 2009 and have been excluded from adjusted net income.
 
The Company will conduct a conference call and webcast today, Nov. 3, at 2:00 p.m. EST during which it will discuss third quarter results. The webcast will include synchronized slides. To listen to the webcast of the conference call and view the slides, visit the Marathon website at . Replays of the webcast will be available through Nov. 17, 2009. Quarterly financial and operational information is also provided on Marathons Web site at in the Quarterly Investor Packet.

In addition to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Marathon has provided supplementally adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure which facilitates comparisons to earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties. Such forecasts generally exclude the effects of items that are considered non-recurring, are difficult to predict or to measure in advance or that are not directly related to Marathon's ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP net income and adjusted net income is provided in a table on page 1 of this release. Adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income as reported in accordance with GAAP. Management, as well as certain investors, uses adjusted net income to evaluate Marathon's financial performance between periods. Management also uses adjusted net income to compare Marathon's performance to certain competitors.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to timing and levels of future production, anticipated future drilling activity, the Volund development, the Droshky development, the AOSP Phase 1 expansion, the Garyville Major Expansion project, the anticipated sale of a wholly owned subsidiary and the overall corporate effective income tax rate. Factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of future production, the anticipated future drilling activity, the Volund development and the Droshky development include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations.  Factors that could affect the AOSP Phase 1 expansion, and the Garyville Major Expansion project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. The AOSP Phase 1 expansion could be further affected by commissioning and start-up risks associated with proto-type equipment and new technology.The sale of a wholly owned subsidiary is subject to customary closing conditions and consultation with the Gabonese Government. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
