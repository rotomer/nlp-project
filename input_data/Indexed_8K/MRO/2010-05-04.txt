HOUSTON, May 4, 2010
Marathon Oil Corporation
 
 
Marathon delivered a strong operating performance across its businesses and solid financial results in the first quarter despite the largest amount of planned maintenance and turnaround activity in the Companys history, said Clarence P. Cazalot Jr., Marathons president and chief executive officer. With most of that work now behind us, the Company is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing global economic recovery and, in particular, from much better oil prices compared to this time last year and improving margins for refined products.
 
Looking forward, our goals are unchanged and remain focused on delivering top-quartile financial and shareholder returns. Well do that by continuing to control expenses, operating our businesses in a reliable and sustainable manner as well as maintaining our disciplined approach to capital investment, Cazalot said.
 
Segment Results
 
Total segment income was $292 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $245 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
Exploration and Production
 
Exploration and Production (E&P) segment income totaled $502 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $83 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon price realizations.
 
First quarter 2010 E&P segment income includes a net pre-tax gain of $51 million related to derivative instruments, the details of which are shown in the table below:
 
 
E&P sales volumes during the quarter averaged 361,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), compared to 393,000 boepd for the same period last year. E&P production available for sale in the first quarter of 2010 averaged 364,000 boepd, in line with previous guidance, compared to 419,000 boepd in the same period last year. The decrease from the prior year was primarily the result of a planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea, the sale of a portion of the Companys Permian Basin assets in the second quarter of 2009 and normal production declines. The difference between production volumes available for sale and recorded sales volumes was due to the timing of international liftings, primarily in the U.K.
 
United States E&P reported income of $109 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $52 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase is primarily related to a 98 percent increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations. Partially offsetting the increase were lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from the Gulf of Mexico due to normal production declines and lower natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes realized due to the Permian Basin divestitures. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased approximately $35 million as a result of lower sales volumes.
 
International E&P income was $393 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $135 million in the first quarter of 2009. This increase in income is primarily related to an 80 percent increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations and increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from Europe. Partially offsetting the impact of realizations were increased exploration expenses.
 
 
In the North Dakota Bakken Shale play, the Company added approximately 14,000 net acres during the quarter, bringing its total acreage holdings to approximately 350,000 net acres. Marathon currently has four drilling rigs operating in the play, with plans to add a fifth during the second quarter. Current net production amounts to approximately 11,000 boepd, compared to 8,500 boepd at the end of the first quarter 2009.
 
The Company submitted apparent high bids totaling approximately $24 million for five blocks offered in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale No. 213 conducted by the Minerals Management Service during the first quarter. Four blocks were bid 100 percent by Marathon and one block was bid in conjunction with partners. The acreage will build on Marathon's strong positions in the Miocene and Lower Tertiary deepwater plays.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Droshky development (Green Canyon Block 244, 100 percent working interest) remains on schedule for first production in mid-2010. The Company has completed all four of its development wells and is awaiting modification of the Bullwinkle platform. The Droshky project is currently expected to cost less than $1 billion, down from the original $1.3 billion budgeted expense.
 
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, Marathon began drilling the Flying Dutchman prospect (Green Canyon Block 511, 63 percent WI and operator) in December 2009 and expects to reach total depth in the second quarter. Marathon also commenced drilling the Innsbruck prospect (Mississippi Canyon Block 993, 85 percent WI and operator) in April and expects to reach total depth in the third quarter.
 
In Indonesia, Marathon expects to spud a deepwater exploration well in the Pasangkayu block (70 percent WI and operator) mid-year.
 
Marathon was awarded three additional onshore exploration licenses with shale gas potential in Poland during the first quarter of 2010, and another in April, bringing its total number of licenses to seven and increasing its total acreage position to approximately 1.4 million net acres. Marathon has a 100 percent interest and is operator of all seven blocks. As previously stated, the Company is pursuing additional licenses in Poland. Marathon plans to begin geologic studies in Poland during 2010 followed by the acquisition of 2D seismic in 2011.
 
A planned turnaround at Marathons production facilities in Equatorial Guinea that began in the first quarter of 2010 was completed under budget and ahead of schedule in April.
 
Marathon estimates second quarter E&P production available for sale will be between 365,000 and 380,000 boepd, excluding the effect of any future acquisitions or dispositions. Anticipated full-year E&P production available for sale remains unchanged at between 390,000 and 410,000 boepd.
 
 
Oil Sands Mining
 
The Oil Sands Mining (OSM) segment reported a loss of $17 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $24 million in the first quarter of 2009. The smaller segment loss in the first quarter of 2010 was primarily related to higher realizations, with a 92 percent improvement in realizations compared to the first quarter of 2009. This was offset by lower volumes sold, primarily as a result of the planned Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) turnaround. In addition, Marathon incurred incremental costs of $30 million related to the turnaround that began in March 2010.
 
Included in segment results is the impact of crude oil derivative instruments, which amounted to a net pre-tax loss of $10 million in the first quarter of 2010 and a net pre-tax gain of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The first quarter 2010 loss consisted of an $8 million realized gain and an $18 million unrealized loss, while the first quarter 2009 gain consisted of a $12 million realized gain and a $4 million unrealized loss.
 
Marathons first quarter 2010 net synthetic crude production (upgraded bitumen excluding blendstocks) from the AOSP mining operation was 21,000 bpd, compared to 26,000 bpd in the same quarter last year.
 
As a result of the turnaround, production was shut down in April with a staged start-up of operations commencing in May. The turnaround is expected to cost $85 million to $120 million net to Marathon, of which $30 million pre-tax was incurred during the first quarter. Marathon holds a 20 percent working interest in the AOSP.
 
     Includes blendstocks.
(a)
     Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments.
(b)
 
The AOSP Expansion 1 project is on track and anticipated to begin operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010/early 2011. Expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, expansion of the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. During the AOSP turnaround discussed above, Expansion 1 tie-ins and pipeline commissioning work will be performed to optimize the construction process.
 
Marathon expects second quarter net synthetic crude production (upgraded bitumen excluding blendstocks) will be between 10,000 and 15,000 bpd, with anticipated full-year net synthetic crude production unchanged at between 22,000 and 28,000 bpd.
 
Integrated Gas
 
Integrated Gas segment income was $44 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $27 million in the first quarter of 2009. Decreased spending on natural gas technology research was the primary reason for the increase in income. Despite a planned turnaround at the Equatorial Guinea gas production facilities, which significantly reduced natural gas volumes to the LNG and methanol facilities during the quarter, Marathon was able to take advantage of higher LNG and methanol prices through the sale of inventories in Equatorial Guinea.
 
 
 
 
Refining, Marketing and Transportation
 
Refining, Marketing and Transportation (RM&T) segment reported a loss of $237 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to income of $159 million in the first quarter of 2009. The refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon was a negative 5.69 cents in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a positive 7.92 cents in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Primary factors contributing to the lower margin were incrementally higher crude oil costs relative to refined product values, quarter over quarter, due to lower sweet/sour differentials and a weaker Contango market structure; higher manufacturing costs resulting from a combination of increased planned turnaround/maintenance and depreciation expenses; and lower wholesale prices relative to applicable spot market values, quarter over quarter.
 
As previously disclosed, Marathon completed, as scheduled, significant planned turnaround and maintenance activities at its Garyville, La., refinery and a planned turnaround at its Texas City, Texas, refinery during the first quarter of 2010. Turnaround costs, plus some additional planned maintenance projects, primarily at Garyville, increased operating expenses by approximately $150 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter last year.
 
The refinery units completed as part of the Garyville Major Expansion project have now been fully integrated into the Garyville refinery and are operating as expected.  The 180,000 bpd expansion establishes the Garyville facility as the fourth-largest U.S. refinery with a crude oil capacity of 436,000 bpd.
 
Crude oil refined during the first quarter of 2010 averaged 1,003,000 bpd, a 152,000 bpd increase over the first quarter of 2009, and total refinery throughputs were 1,100,000 bpd, up from 1,071,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
Speedway SuperAmerica LLC (SSA) gasoline and distillate gross margin per gallon averaged 11.95 cents in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 10.68 cents in the first quarter of 2009. SSA first quarter 2010 same store gasoline sales volumes were substantially unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2009, while same store merchandise sales increased by approximately 7 percent for the same period.
 
During the first quarter, Speedway was ranked the nations top retail gasoline brand for the second consecutive year, according to the 2010 EquiTrend Brand Study conducted by Harris Interactive.
As of March 31, the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrading Project was approximately 35 percent complete and on schedule for an expected completion in the second half of 2012.
 
Corporate and Special Items
 
During the first quarter of 2010, Marathon closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola with an effective date of Jan. 1, 2009.  The Company received net proceeds of $1.3 billion and recorded a $449 million after-tax gain on the sale. Marathon retained a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32.
 
In March 2010, Marathon completed a reservoir study which resulted in a portion of its Powder River Basin field being removed from plans for future development.  As a result, an after-tax impairment of $262 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Marathon currently offers retiree prescription drug coverage equivalent to Medicare Part D coverage and receives a subsidy from the government to partially offset this cost. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act that were signed into law in March 2010 include provisions that eliminate an income tax benefit related to the subsidy for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2012. Enactment of the legislation resulted in a $45 million charge to deferred income tax expense during the first quarter.
 
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause changes in the U.S. dollar value of deferred tax balances denominated in foreign currencies. Both net income and adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2010 include a $33 million gain due to a foreign currency remeasurement related to income tax balances denominated in foreign currencies, compared to a foreign currency remeasurement gain of $28 million in the same period last year.
 
Starting with the second quarter of 2010, Marathon will no longer provide interim guidance.
 
The Company will conduct a conference call and webcast today, May 4, at 4:00 p.m. EDT during which it will discuss first-quarter results. The webcast will include synchronized slides. To listen to the webcast of the conference call and view the slides, visit the Marathon website at . Replays of the webcast will be available through May 18, 2010. Quarterly financial and operational information is also provided on Marathons website at in the Quarterly Investor Packet.

In addition to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Marathon has provided supplementally net income adjusted for special items, a non-GAAP financial measure which facilitates comparisons to earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties.  Such forecasts generally exclude the effects of items that are considered non-recurring, are difficult to predict or to measure in advance or that are not directly related to Marathon's ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP net income and net income adjusted for special items is provided in a table on page 1 of this release.  Net income adjusted for special items should not be considered a substitute for net income as reported in accordance with GAAP.  Management, as well as certain investors, uses net income adjusted for special items to evaluate Marathon's financial performance between periods.  Management also uses net income adjusted for special items to compare Marathon's performance to certain competitors.
