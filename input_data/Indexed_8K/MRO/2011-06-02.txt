On May 31, 2011, Marathon Oil Corporation entered into a definitive agreement with Hilcorp Resources Holdings, LP to purchase its assets in the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas for $3.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments. Hilcorp Resources Holdings is a partnership between affiliates of Hilcorp Energy Company and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP. The assets include approximately 141,000 net acres (217,000 gross) primarily in Atascosa, Karnes, Gonzales and DeWitt counties in Texas.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and Hart-Scott-Rodino approval and is expected to close November 1, 2011 with an effective date of May 1, 2011.
