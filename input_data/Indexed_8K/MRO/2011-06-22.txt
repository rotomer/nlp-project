Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
On May 26, 2011, our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission its final amendment to its registration statement on Form 10 relating to the spin-off of MPC from Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon Oil).  The separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC relating to the spin-off provides that the aggregate balance of cash and cash equivalents that MPC will have on hand as of the distribution date will be as Marathon Oil deems appropriate, so long as that balance is not less than $1.425 billion.  In accordance with the separation and distribution agreement, Marathon Oil has determined that MPCs aggregate cash and cash equivalent balance as of the distribution date will be approximately $1.625 billion.
