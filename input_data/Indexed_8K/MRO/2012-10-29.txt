(viii) the Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
In addition, such counsel shall state that they have reviewed the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, with representatives of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and with the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and related matters were discussed, and although the purpose of such counsel's professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, and such counsel has not undertaken to verify independently any of the factual matters in such documents, and although many of the determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus involve matters of a non-legal nature and, accordingly, such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (except to the extent stated in paragraph (vii) above), subject to the foregoing and on the basis of the information such counsel gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, such counsel shall advise you that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the latest Effective Date, the Time of Sale Information, as of the Time of Sale, and the Prospectus, as of its date and the date hereof, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act; and (b) nothing has come to such counsel's attention that caused such counsel to believe that (1) the Registration Statement, as of the latest Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (2) the Time of Sale Information, as of the Time of Sale, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (3) the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the Closing Date, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that in each case such counsel need not express any belief with respect to (w) any financial statements, including the notes and schedules, if any, thereto, and any auditor's report on any audited portion thereof, and any management report on internal control over financial reporting and any auditor's report with respect thereto, (x) any other accounting or financial information and any reserve engineering or statistical information (y) representations and warranties and other statements of fact contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement or (z) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1.
(g) the Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Sylvia J. Kerrigan, Esq., Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for the Company, to the effect that:
(i) the Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
 
(ii) each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated or formed, is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, has the corporate, limited liability company, limited partnership or partnership power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(iii) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities will not contravene any agreement, indenture or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is known to such counsel and material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to such counsel's knowledge, any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency that has not already been obtained is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities, except such as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities;
(iv) the statements incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the captions "Item 1.  Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters" and "Item 3.  Legal Proceedings" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, accurately present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein;
(v) such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental investigations or proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required; and
(vi) the documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, as of the dates they were filed with the Commission or to the extent such documents were subsequently amended prior to the date hereof, at the time so amended, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder.
 
In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel has, or attorneys under such counsel's supervision have, participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and with representatives of its independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention to lead such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at its effective date and the date of this Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date or the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In this paragraph and in Section 7(g)(vi) above, references to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus do not include references to any of the following, as to which such counsel will not be asked to comment, which the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus contains or incorporates by reference or omits: (i) any financial statements, including the notes and schedules, if any, thereto, and any auditor's report on any audited portion thereof, (ii) any management report on internal control over financial reporting and any auditor's report with respect thereto, (iii) any other accounting or financial information and any reserve engineering or statistical information, (iv) any statement or representation in any exhibit to the Registration Statement and (v) the Form T-1.

provided
 
(j) you shall have received on and as of the Closing Date an opinion and negative assurance letter of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you.
8. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information (or any part thereof), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability is caused by an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any such document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein.
provided, however
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) are caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information (or any part thereof), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information (or any part thereof), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such directors, officers and control persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by the first of the named Representatives on Schedules I-A and I-B hereto and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, officers and control persons of the Company or authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 8 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such
 
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto, and not joint.
The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
9. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company, if after the Time of Sale and prior to the Closing Date: (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or The New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred (a) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis or (b) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction shall have occurred that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
10. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase under this Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-tenth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased, and arrangements reasonably satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
11. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Securities.
 
12. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
13. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by you jointly or by the first of the named Representatives set forth in Schedules I-A and I-B hereto alone on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by you jointly or by the third of the named Representatives set forth in Schedules I-A and I-B hereto alone shall be binding upon the Underwriters. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be given at the address set forth in Schedules I-A and I-B hereto. Notices to the Company shall be given to it at Marathon Oil Corporation, 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 (facsimile: (713) 296-9375); Attention: Corporate Secretary.
14. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
15. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws provisions thereof that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Exhibit 5.1
 
October 29, 2012
Marathon Oil Corporation
5555 San Felipe Street
Houston, Texas 77056-2799
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Marathon Oil Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Marathon Oil"), has engaged us to render the opinions we express below in connection with its offering of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior notes due November 1, 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior notes due November 1, 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"), which it is offering under the registration statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-168171) (as amended, the "Registration Statement") it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, the "1933 Act"), which relates to Marathon Oil's offering and sale of various securities under the 1933 Act's Rule 415.
Marathon Oil will issue the Notes under an indenture dated as of February 26, 2002 between it and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee, relating to senior debt securities of Marathon Oil (the "Indenture").
For purposes of the opinions we express below, we have examined, among other agreements, instruments and documents, the following:
 -  the restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, of Marathon Oil;
 -  the Registration Statement and its exhibits;
 -  the prospectus the Registration Statement includes;
 -  the prospectus supplement dated October 24, 2012 that Marathon Oil prepared and filed with the SEC on October 25, 2012 under the 1933 Act's Rule 424(b)(5);
 -  the Indenture;
 -  the underwriting agreement dated October 24, 2012 among Marathon Oil, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., RBS Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes (the "Underwriting Agreement");
 
 -  the resolutions of the board of directors of Marathon Oil (the "Board"), a committee of the Board and a committee of Marathon Oil's officers the Board has established, which authorize the issuance of the Notes and approve the terms of the offering and sale of the Notes, including the Establishment Action (as defined in the Indenture) relating to the Notes;
 -  corporate records of Marathon Oil, including minute books it has furnished us; and
 -  certificates of public officials and of representatives of Marathon Oil.
In giving these opinions, we have relied, to the extent we deemed appropriate, with respect to factual matters, upon certificates, statements or other representations of officers or other representatives of Marathon Oil and of public officials, and we have assumed that all signatures on documents we have examined are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original copies of those documents and those original copies are authentic.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1. Marathon Oil is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2. The Notes will, when they have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Establishment Action, and duly purchased and paid for in accordance with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Marathon Oil, enforceable against Marathon Oil in accordance with their terms, except as that enforcement is subject to (a) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (c) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.
We limit the opinions we express above in all respects to matters of the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, each as in effect on the date hereof.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to Marathon Oil's current report on Form 8-K reporting the offering of the Notes. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit we are in the category of persons whose written consent Section 7 of the 1933 Act requires to be filed with the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Baker Botts L.L.P.
