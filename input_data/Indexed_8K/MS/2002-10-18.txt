Item 5. Other Events On October 17, 2002, Standard & Poor's announced that it had lowered its long- and short-term counterparty credit ratings on Morgan Stanley and one other major financial services firm to single-'A'-plus/'A-1' from double-'A'-minus/'A-1'-plus. The short-term counterparty credit rating on one other firm was also lowered. Standard & Poor's stated that the actions were due to its belief that the industry's weak operating environment will continue to pressure earnings, and noted that liquidity is strong at all three firms and that each firm has adequate capital for its ratings. Standard & Poor's removed Morgan Stanley from CreditWatch, and its outlook for the firm is now stable. The information above may contain forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management's beliefs and expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company's future results, please see "Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Competition and Regulation" under each of "Securities," "Investment Management" and "Credit Services" in Part I, Item 1 in the Company's 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for fiscal 2002.
