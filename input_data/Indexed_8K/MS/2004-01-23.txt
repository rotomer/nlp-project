Exhibit 99.1 Morgan Stanley Records Recently Announced Award of Damages in Fourth Quarter 2003 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2004--Morgan Stanley today announced that it will record in its fiscal 2003 fourth quarter the recently announced award of damages in the action commenced by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton ("LVMH") against the Company in connection with the Company's research coverage of LVMH. On January 12, the Paris Commercial Court in France awarded LVMH Euro 30 million, reserved the right to award additional damages and appointed an expert to determine whether additional damages are appropriate and, if so, in what amount. The Company intends to appeal the original judgment and to oppose any proposed award of additional damages to LVMH. In light of the Euro 30 million award, the Company is taking a $38 million pretax charge ($27 million after tax, and $0.02 per diluted share) that will be recorded as an other expense and included in the Company's 2003 results. This charge is recorded in the Company's Institutional Securities business segment. This amends the earnings announcement of December 18, 2003. For the fiscal year of 2003, the Company will report net income of $3,787 million, or diluted earning per share of $3.45, compared to $2,988 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.69 in fiscal 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 net income will be $1,014 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.92, compared to $732 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.67 in the fourth quarter of 2002. Although the judgment of the Paris Commercial Court was rendered subsequent to the Company's fiscal 2003 year-end and the Company's fourth quarter 2003 earnings release, it is appropriate to account for the judgment in the fourth quarter of 2003, based on accounting rules applicable to this type of subsequent event. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm and a market leader in securities, investment management and credit services. With more than 600 offices in 28 countries, Morgan Stanley connects people, ideas and capital to help clients achieve their financial aspirations.
