Exhibit 99.1 Morgan Stanley Earnings Per Share Up 35%; First Quarter Net Income $1.2 Billion; Return on Equity 19% NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 18, 2004--Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MWD) today reported net income of $1,226 million for the quarter ended February 29, 2004 -- an increase of 35 percent from the first quarter of 2003 and 21 percent from the fourth quarter of 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $1.11 -- compared with $0.82 a year ago and $0.92 in the fourth quarter. First quarter net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) were $6.2 billion -- 14 percent ahead of first quarter 2003 and 23 percent ahead of fourth quarter 2003. "We had an excellent first quarter with a return on equity of 19 percent, driven by record revenues in a number of businesses and impressive market share gains in investment banking" said Philip J. Purcell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our sales and trading businesses continue to perform very well, retail securities and investment management posted strong results and Discover Card had a record quarter." INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES Institutional Securities reported pretax income(1) of $1,186 million, a 26 percent increase over last year's first quarter. Net revenues reached their highest level since the second quarter of 2000, driven by the Company's fixed income business and an improved environment for equity underwriting and trading. -- Fixed income sales and trading net revenues increased slightly from last year's first quarter to a record $1.7 billion. Revenues were higher in both credit products and interest rate and currency products. Credit products benefited from increased securitization flows in commercial and residential whole loans, strong customer volumes and tightening credit spreads. Interest rate and currency products benefited from favorable trading conditions in foreign exchange, tax-exempts and emerging markets debt. Commodities also had a solid quarter, reflecting volatile oil markets. -- Equity sales and trading net revenues were $1.1 billion, a 13 percent increase from a year ago and the highest total since the second quarter of 2001. The increase was driven by higher revenues in the Company's global cash business, resulting from higher market volume and a strong primary calendar. Higher revenues in the Company's Prime Brokerage business also contributed to the increase. -- Advisory revenues were $232 million, up 40 percent from first quarter 2003, even though industry-wide completed M&A transaction volume fell 13 percent over the same period.(2) -- Total underwriting revenues rose 51 percent from last year's first quarter to $507 million. Equity underwriting revenues increased nearly 150 percent, reflecting a surge in industry-wide equity new issuance activity from a weak first quarter 2003. Fixed income underwriting revenues declined 7 percent from a year ago, reflecting a modest decline in industry-wide activity from high levels the previous year.(2) -- For the calendar year-to-date, the Company ranked second in announced global M&A with a 45 percent market share; first in worldwide equity and equity-related issuances with a 14 percent market share; first in worldwide IPOs with a 29 percent market share; and fourth in global debt issuances with a 7 percent market share.(3) INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR GROUP Individual Investor Group pretax income was $166 million, compared with $61 million in the first quarter of 2003. -- Net revenues increased 23 percent to $1.2 billion, as renewed investor interest in equities drove a 49 percent increase in commissions, and asset management, distribution and administration fees rose 22 percent on higher asset levels. -- Total client assets were $595 billion, an increase of $97 billion from the end of last year's first quarter. Approximately 15 percent of the increase was attributable to net new cash flows. Client assets in fee-based accounts increased 36 percent from a year ago to $143 billion, and the percentage of total client assets in fee-based accounts continued to increase, reaching 24 percent compared with 21 percent a year ago. -- At quarter-end, the number of global financial advisors was 10,832 -- a decrease of 254 for the quarter and 1,224 over the past year. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT Investment Management pretax income increased 70 percent from last year's first quarter to $170 million. Higher revenues, reflecting both an increase in average assets under management and a more favorable asset mix due to improving equity markets, drove the increase. -- The Company's assets under management increased $91 billion, or 23 percent, from a year ago to $495 billion,(4) primarily as a result of market appreciation. Total net fund flows were also positive over the same period. -- Retail assets were $294 billion, $17 billion above the previous quarter and $48 billion higher than last year's first quarter. Institutional assets of $201 billion increased $16 billion over the quarter and were $43 billion above a year ago. -- Among full-service brokerage firms, the Company had the highest number of domestic funds (41) receiving one of Morningstar's two highest ratings.(5) In addition, the percent of the Company's fund assets performing in the top half of the Lipper rankings for one year was 54 percent compared to 60 percent a year ago.(6) CREDIT SERVICES Credit Services pretax income rose 26 percent from first quarter 2003 to a record $365 million on a managed loan basis, driven by improved credit quality and favorable financing costs, partially offset by lower merchant and cardmember fees. -- Managed credit card loans of $47.3 billion at quarter end were 9 percent lower than a year ago, mainly due to lower balance transfer volume as the Company decreased its promotional efforts to focus on improving profitability. The interest rate spread widened 99 basis points over the same period, as the cost of funds declined and yields increased. -- Merchant and cardmember fees were $519 million, down 5 percent from last year's first quarter. An increase in cardmember rewards and a decline in cardmember late fees, reflecting lower delinquencies, was partially offset by an increase in merchant discount revenues. -- The credit card net charge-off rate was 6.31 percent, 14 basis points higher than a year ago, but 56 basis points below the fourth quarter. The increase in the net charge-off rate from last year's first quarter was driven by a $4.1 billion decline in average credit card loan balances, which more than offset a decline in net charge-off dollars. The net charge-off rate fell from the fourth quarter as Discover's bankruptcy losses dropped to their lowest level in nearly three years. -- The over-30-day delinquency rate declined 53 basis points to 5.80 percent, and the over-90-day delinquency rate declined 9 basis points to 2.86 percent from the first quarter of 2003. The decline in the over-30-day rate was the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. The Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.25 quarterly dividend per common share. The dividend is payable on April 30, 2004, to common shareholders of record on April 9, 2004. Total capital at February 29, 2004 was $96.4 billion, including $29.0 billion of common shareholders' equity and junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts. Book value per common share was $23.75, based on 1.1 billion shares outstanding.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MORGAN STANLEY The following pages (F-15 - F-16) present a reconciliation for certain information disclosed on pages F-7, F-12 and F-14. The data is presented on both a "managed" loan basis and as reported under generally accepted accounting principles ("owned" loan basis). Managed loan data assume that the Company's securitized loan receivables have not been sold and presents the results of securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the Company's owned loans. The Company operates its Credit Services business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis. Accordingly, underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans. The Company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations. In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis, which provides a more meaningful comparison to industry competitors.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MORGAN STANLEY The following page (F-17) presents a reconciliation of adjusted assets. Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a company's overall liquidity and capital policies. The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends. Adjusted assets exclude certain self-funded assets considered to have minimal market, credit and/or liquidity risk that are generally attributable to matched book and securities lending businesses as measured by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non- derivative short positions. In addition, the adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders' equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill, as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs.
