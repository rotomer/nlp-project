Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. As previously disclosed by Morgan Stanley (the "Company") in its Form 8-K dated March 23, 2005, the Company has been reviewing recent developments in the case captioned Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (the "Coleman litigation") in order to determine whether it is necessary for the Company to increase its previously announced reserve of $260 million for this litigation. As a result of this review, the Company has determined that it is necessary to increase its reserve with respect to the Coleman litigation by $100 million. This increase will impact the Company's previously-announced preliminary results for the first quarter of 2005 as follows: net income will be reduced to $1,402 million from $1,468 million; earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis will be reduced by $0.06 to $1.31 (basic) and $1.29 (diluted), respectively; return on average common equity will be reduced to 19.7% from 20.7%; and the Company's pre-tax profit margin will be reduced to 30.5% from 32%. The Company intends to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2005, which will contain full financial results for the first quarter of 2005, with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about April 6, 2005.
