Item 8.01. Other Events. The following disclosure supplements the disclosure regarding Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. made by Morgan Stanley (the "Company") in previous filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On May 16, 2005, a jury for the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, Florida returned a verdict in favor of Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. ("CPH") with respect to its claims against Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS&Co."), a subsidiary of the Company. The jury awarded CPH $604,334,000 in compensatory damages. This amount may be subject to deduction, at the determination of the Court, for amounts previously received by CPH from others in settlements of related claims. The jury will consider the amount, if any, of punitive damages to be awarded to CPH. Once a final judgment is entered, MS&Co. will appeal and move to stay the judgment pending appeal. The Company previously established a reserve of $360 million for this matter. The Company will reassess the level of reserve required as a result of this verdict.
