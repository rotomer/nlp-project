Item 8.01. Other Events. The following disclosure supplements the disclosure regarding Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. (the "Coleman litigation") made by Morgan Stanley (the "Company") in previous filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On May 18, 2005, the jury in the Coleman litigation awarded $850 million in punitive damages to Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. ("CPH") with respect to CPH's claims against Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS&Co."), a subsidiary of the Company. This amount is in addition to the compensatory damages that the jury awarded CPH on May 16, 2005. The Court will determine whether pre-judgment interest should be awarded to CPH and what amounts should be deducted from the award because of the settlements of related claims CPH entered into with others. Once a final judgment is entered, MS&Co. will appeal and move to stay the judgment pending appeal. The Company believes that it is financially strong and this latest development, while disappointing, will not impede its ability to serve its clients and grow its business. The Company previously established a reserve of $360 million for the Coleman litigation. The Company will reassess the level of reserve required as a result of this development.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. MORGAN STANLEY (Registrant) By: /s/ Ronald T. Carman ------------------------------- Name: Ronald T. Carman Title: Assistant Secretary Date: May 18, 2005
