Item 8.01. Other Events. (1) The following disclosure supplements the disclosure made by Morgan Stanley (the "Company") in previous filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning certain legal proceedings involving the Company and Parmalat. On June 23, 2005, the Company and its subsidiaries Morgan Stanley & Co. International Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank International Ltd. entered into a proposed settlement agreement (the "Agreement") with the administrator of Parmalat. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to pay (euro)155 million to Parmalat as part of a global settlement of all existing and potential claims between Morgan Stanley and Parmalat, while preserving the Company's (euro)35 million claim which was admitted in December 2004 in the administration of Parmalat. The Agreement is subject to the approval of the Italian Government. The Company believes that it is adequately reserved with respect to the matters covered by the settlement. (2) The following disclosure supplements the disclosure regarding Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. (the "Coleman litigation") made by the Company in previous filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On June 23, 2005, in the Coleman litigation, the Florida state court awarded approximately $208 million in pre-judgment interest to Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. ("CPH") with respect to CPH's claims against Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS&Co."), a subsidiary of the Company. The court also determined that MS&Co. was entitled to set-offs in the amount of approximately $85 million from the compensatory damages previously awarded to CPH. The court set the final total judgment at $1,577,696,175.83, plus future interest at the rate of 7% per year. The Company's reserve with respect to the Coleman litigation is $360 million and this reserve has not changed as a result of the final judgment. MS&Co. will appeal and move to stay the judgment pending appeal.
