Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers. (d) On August 17, 2005, Morgan Stanley (the "Company") announced that each of Roy J. Bostock, Charles H. Noski and O. Griffith Sexton had been elected to the Company's Board of Directors. The elections are effective September 15, 2005. The size of the Company's Board of Directors was increased to fourteen in connection with the elections. Mr. Bostock and Mr. Sexton will serve in the class of directors whose terms expire in 2006. There will be five directors in that class. Mr. Noski will serve in the class of directors whose terms expire in 2008. There will be five directors in that class. As previously announced, the Company intends that, commencing with the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the entire Board of Directors will stand for election by shareholders each year. Mr. Bostock, Mr. Noski and Mr. Sexton have not been assigned to any committees of the Board of Directors. Mr. Sexton currently serves as an advisory director of the Company. In connection with his service as an advisory director, the Company has provided Mr. Sexton with cash payments, medical and dental insurance, secretarial services and office space. Mr. Sexton received approximately $100,000 in cash payments from the Company in fiscal 2004 and has received approximately $66,700 in cash payments year-to-date in fiscal 2005. Commencing September 15, 2005, Mr. Sexton will continue to serve as an advisory director and will continue to receive Company-subsidized medical and dental insurance, secretarial services and office space, but will no longer receive any cash payments in connection with his advisory director services. Mr. Bostock's son-in-law, Daniel Waters, is a member of FrontPoint Partners LLC. FrontPoint has sponsored a number of limited partnerships (the "FrontPoint Funds"). A Company subsidiary is prime broker for several FrontPoint Funds, and, from time to time, FrontPoint Funds transact other business with the Company's subsidiaries. Transactions are in the ordinary course of the Company's business and on substantially the same terms as comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. The FrontPoint Funds paid approximately $5.0 million in fiscal 2004 and approximately $4.8 million in fiscal 2005 (through July 31, 2005) in fees to the Company for such services.
