Diluted earnings per share were $0.13 compared with $0.76 a year ago and $0.86 in the second quarter. Results for the third quarter of 2005 include an after-tax charge of approximately $1 billion for discontinued operations related to the planned sale of the Companys aircraft financing business.
 
Income from continuing operations was $1,166 million for the quarter, an increase of 36 percent from the third quarter of 2004 and 25 percent from the second quarter of 2005.

The results for the quarter also include compensation charges for senior management severance and new hires.

These compensation charges were allocated to the business segments as follows: Institutional Retail Brokerage, $31 million; Asset Management, $16 million; and Discover, $22 million. Excluding the effect of both the discontinued operations and the charges for senior management severance and new hires, quarterly earnings per share and annualized return on average common equity on a pro forma basis would be $1.21 and 18.9 percent, respectively.

John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, Morgan Stanley achieved strong revenue growth this quarter, particularly across all aspects of our institutional securities business. Given the management changes and other distractions the Firm has faced over the past nine months, this impressive performance is a testament to the talent and commitment of our people and the fundamental strength of our franchise.
Institutional securities achieved record revenues, with fixed incomes best third quarter ever and strong results in both equities and investment banking. We maintained our #1 position in M&A, we were #3 in global IPOs, and we were #5 in global debt and equity underwriting. In key businesses, like retail and asset management, we are bringing new leadership to help us build on their strong potential, and we are making necessary investments in infrastructure to support the business.
 
 
 
Even with this quarters strong performance, we believe there is substantial room for further improvement over time, both to grow the business and to improve profitability. Our goal for Morgan Stanley is to be a clear leader in delivering not only innovative services to our clients, but also superior returns to our shareholders. We already have moved quickly to enhance the leadership of key businesses, make critical strategic decisions and further strengthen the Board of Directors. We still have a great deal of work to do, but the franchise is fundamentally strong, and we are intensely focused on improving profit margins and growth within a robust risk and control environment, with the overriding goal of creating substantial long-term shareholder value.
Key actions Morgan Stanley took over the past three months to improve performance include:
INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES
Institutional Securities posted income before taxes

of $1,288 million, up 91 percent from the third quarter of 2004. Record net revenues of $4.2 billion were 51 percent higher, driven by near record results in the Companys fixed income business and strong results in both its equities and investment banking businesses. The quarters pre-tax margin was 31 percent compared with 24 percent a year ago.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RETAIL BROKERAGE
Retail Brokerage reported pre-tax income of $30 million compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2004. The modest increase in earnings resulted from higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expenses. Non-compensation expenses for both periods were adversely affected by significant charges related to legal and regulatory matters. Charges in the current quarter primarily relate to alleged employment matters, but also include certain regulatory and branch litigation matters. The quarter's pre-tax margin was 2 percent, equal to a year ago.
 
 
 
 
 
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset Management reported pre-tax income of $162 million, 25 percent lower than last year's $217 million.  The quarter's pre-tax margin was 24 percent compared with 31 percent a year ago. Net revenues fell 2 percent to $679 million, reflecting lower Private Equity revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenues from higher average assets under management. Non-interest expenses increased 9 percent to $517 million. Excluding results from the Private Equity business, pre-tax income declined 1 percent over last year and the pre-tax margin was 22 percent compared to 24 percent a year ago. Assets under management were $428 billion, up $34 billion or 9 percent from the third quarter of last year. The increase over the past year resulted primarily from market appreciation.
 
 
 
 
 
DISCOVER
Discover posted pre-tax income of $239 million on a managed basis, down 28 percent from $330 million a year ago. Net revenues of $911 million were 3 percent higher than last years third quarter, reflecting a lower provision for loan losses and higher merchant, cardmember and other fees - partially offset by lower net interest income. Non-interest expenses were significantly higher primarily as a result of the costs noted above associated with senior management changes, and higher operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of PULSE, which was acquired during the first quarter of 2005. The quarters pre-tax margin was 26 percent compared with 37 percent a year ago.
