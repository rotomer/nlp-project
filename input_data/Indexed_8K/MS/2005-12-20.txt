Morgan Stanley Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
Record Quarterly Earnings per Share of $1.68; Fourth Quarter Earnings Up 49%;
Record Full Year Net Revenues of $26.8 Billion
NEW YORK, December 20, 2005 -- Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MWD) today reported net income for the fourth quarter ended November 30, 2005 of $1,786 million, up 49 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) were $7.0 billion, 28 percent above last years fourth quarter. Non-interest expenses of $4.8 billion represented a 29 percent increase from last year. Results for the quarter include an income tax benefit of $280 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, resulting from the Companys repatriation of approximately $4.0 billion of qualifying foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.68 compared with $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2004. The annualized return on average common equity for the fourth quarter was 25.2 percent compared with 17.4 percent a year ago.
Record net revenues for the fiscal year of $26.8 billion were 13 percent higher than last year and non-interest expenses of $19.4 billion were 15 percent above 2004. Net income for the fiscal year was $4,260 million, a decline of 5 percent compared with last years $4,486 million. Results for the year included an after-tax charge in the third quarter of approximately $1 billion for discontinued operations related to the planned sale of the Companys aircraft financing business. Diluted earnings per share were $3.95 compared with $4.06 for fiscal 2004. The return on average common equity was 15.0 percent for the year.
 
Income from continuing operations was $5,192 million for the year, an increase of 13 percent from last years $4,589 million. Diluted earnings per share from

Results for 2005
i the following: legal charges related to Sunbeam/Coleman and Parmalat of $535 million ($0.34/share); compensation related to senior management severance and new hires of $311 million ($0.20/share); World Trade Center insurance settlements of $251 million ($0.16/share); and a tax benefit under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of $280 million

($0.26/share).

Pro forma return on average common equity from continuing operations is computed assuming a $1.5 billion equity allocation for the Companys aircraft financing business for all periods through July 2005 and $0.4 billion for all periods from August 2005 through November 2005. The decrease in equity allocated to this business primarily reflects the decrease in asset value as a result of the charge referred to above. 
 
 
 
 
John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, Morgan Stanley achieved record revenues for 2005 and record earnings for the fourth quarter. Through focus and commitment, the people of Morgan Stanley have delivered two straight quarters of improving results. Our performance this year was particularly strong in institutional securities, where we saw record revenues in fixed income, record revenues in prime brokerage and significant increases across our equities and investment banking businesses.  We achieved #2 positions in global announced M&A and IPOs and #3 in global equity.
Even with record revenues for the year, we have work to do to achieve the full performance that this franchise is capable of delivering. We have a clear strategy for improving our performance; we have put in place the right leadership for each of our businesses; and we have continued to strengthen our corporate governance and add outstanding new directors to our Board. In short, we have made significant progress, but know there is a great deal of work ahead of us and are intensely focused on the execution of our strategy to create shareholder value.
INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES
FOURTH QUARTER
Institutional Securities posted income before taxes of $1,576 million, up 42 percent from $1,108 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.

FULL YEAR
Institutional Securities reported pre-tax income of $4,754 million, an 11 percent increase from 2004. Net revenues rose 20 percent to a record $15.7 billion, driven by record results in fixed income sales and trading and significant increases in advisory and equity sales and trading. Non-interest expenses rose 24 percent to $10.9 billion, reflecting higher compensation levels, costs associated with increased business activity and increased legal reserves. Legal charges for the Sunbeam/Coleman and Parmalat matters of $535 million and charges for senior management severance and new hires of $193 million accounted for over one-third of the increase. The years pre-tax margin was 30 percent compared with 32 percent in 2004 and the full year return on equity from continuing operations was 24 percent up from 22 percent in the prior year.

Advisory revenues rose 28 percent to $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase in industry-wide completed M&A activity. Underwriting revenues rose 8 percent from last year to $2.0 billion. Equity underwriting revenues fell 9 percent, while fixed income underwriting revenues rose 27 percent.
For the calendar year-to-date, the Company ranked second in global announced M&A with a 27 percent market share, second in global IPOs with a 9 percent market share, third in global completed M&A with a 26 percent market share, third in global equity and equity-linked issuances with a 9 percent market share and fifth in global debt issuances with a 6 percent market share.

Fixed income sales and trading revenues were a record $6.8 billion, up 22 percent from 2004. The increase was driven by a record year for interest rate & currency products and credit products. Interest rate & currency products benefited from strong new deal activity with clients and positioning results. Interest rate cash and derivatives and emerging markets businesses were particular standouts for the year. Credit products benefited from increased customer flows and favorable trading conditions. Commodities sales and trading was down slightly from a record 2004 as lower revenues in oil liquids were partially offset by record results in electricity and natural gas.
Equity sales and trading revenues rose 18 percent to $4.8 billion and were the highest yearly revenues since 2000. Derivative revenues were up despite continued low levels of volatility. Prime Brokerage had a record year driven by robust growth in client asset balances. Equity cash revenues rose on higher market volumes, particularly in non-U.S. markets.
 
Principal investments gains were $656 million for the year compared with $364 million in 2004. Significant gains resulted from Commodities investment in the Intercontinental Exchange, Equitys investment in the International Securities Exchange and Corporate Credits investment in Digital Globe Inc.

RETAIL BROKERAGE
FOURTH QUARTER
Retail Brokerage pre-tax income for the fourth quarter was $84 million, up 65 percent compared with $51 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The quarter's pre-tax margin was 7 percent compared with 5 percent in last years fourth quarter. Last years fourth quarter was negatively affected by a change in the Companys method of accounting for certain asset management and account fees that reduced pre-tax income by $80 million. Excluding this methodology change, pre-tax income would have declined by 36 percent, as higher revenues were more than offset by increased non-interest expenses.
 
FULL YEAR
Retail Brokerage reported pre-tax income of $585 million, up 58 percent from last years $371 million. Excluding the effect of the accounting methodology change mentioned above and the $198 million World Trade Center insurance settlement, pre-tax income would have declined by 14 percent. Net revenues for the year were $5.0 billion, a 9 percent increase over a year ago and the highest yearly revenues since 2000. Excluding the methodology change, net revenues would have increased 6 percent over last year. Higher asset management, distribution and administration fees driven primarily by an increase in client assets in fee-based accounts more than offset lower commissions resulting from lower transaction volumes. Total non-interest expenses were $4.4 billion, a 4 percent increase from a year ago.Excluding the World Trade Center insurance settlement, non-interest expenses rose 9 percent from 2004. The increase was driven by higher compensation expenses, increased sub-advisory fees related to higher net revenues and higher costs associated with legal and regulatory matters. Non-compensation expenses for both years were adversely affected by significant charges related to legal and regulatory matters. The years pre-tax margin was 12 percent compared with 8 percent in 2004. Excluding the World Trade Center settlement, the 2005 pre-tax margin would have been 8 percent. The full year return on equity from continuing operations was 11 percent and 7 percent in the prior year.

Total client assets increased to $617 billion, up 2 percent from fiscal 2004 year-end. Client assets in fee-based accounts rose 10 percent to a record $173 billion at fiscal year-end and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 28 percent. The number of global representatives at year-end was 9,526 -- a decline of 1,436 from a year ago resulting largely from the sales force reduction announced during the year and attrition.
 
ASSET MANAGEMENT
FOURTH QUARTER
Asset Managements pre-tax income was $383 million, a 66 percent increase from $231 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Non-interest expenses increased 5 percent to $507 million.
 
FULL YEAR
Asset Management reported pre-tax income of $1,007 million, up 22 percent from last years $827 million. The years pre-tax margin was 35 percent compared with 30 percent a year ago. Full year return on equity from continuing operations was 36 percent, up from 29 percent in the prior year.
Net revenues increased 6 percent, reflecting higher private equity revenues and an increase in revenues from higher assets under management. Non-interest expenses declined 1 percent to $1.9 billion as the benefit from the World Trade Center insurance settlement was offset by charges related to senior management severance and new hires. Investment gains for the year were $326 million compared with $248 million a year ago. The largest gains were associated with the Companys holdings in Triana Energy Holdings, LLC and Aventine Renewable Energy Holding, LLC. Excluding results from the Private Equity business, pre-tax income increased 16 percent over last year and the pre-tax profit margin was 29 percent compared with 26 percent a year ago.

Assets under management or supervision at November 30, 2005 were $431 billion, up $7 billion, or 2 percent, from a year ago. The increase resulted from market appreciation partly offset by customer out-flows. The percent of the Companys long-term fund assets performing in the top half of the Lipper rankings was 61 percent over one year, 71 percent over three years, 71 percent over five years and 83 percent over ten years.
DISCOVER
FOURTH QUARTER
Discovers fourth quarter pre-tax income was $65 million on a managed basis, compared with $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net revenues of $694 million were 21 percent lower than last years fourth quarter. The decline reflects a spike in bankruptcy notices preceding new federal legislation effective October 2005, which caused an increase in the provision for loan losses and a reduction in the valuation of the Companys residual interests in securitized receivables. The effects of these increased bankruptcy notices reduced pre-tax income by approximately $180 million. In addition, net interest income was lower resulting from a higher cost of funds. Non-interest expenses increased 3 percent to $629 million, primarily due to higher compensation. The quarters pre-tax margin was 9 percent compared with 31 percent a year ago.

FULL YEAR
Discover reported pre-tax income of $921 million on a managed basis, down 25 percent from 2004 earnings of $1,221 million. Net revenues of $3.5 billion were 2 percent lower than 2004. The modest decline in net revenues was driven by lower net interest income, reflecting a higher cost of funds - partially offset by a decline in the provision for loan losses, reflecting improved credit quality partially mitigated by the spike in bankruptcy notices. Non-interest expenses increased 9 percent to $2.5 billion resulting from increases in both non-compensation and compensation expenses. The managed credit card charge-off rate decreased 77 basis points from a year ago to 5.23 percent. The over-30-day-delinquency rate decreased 57 basis points to 3.98 percent and the over-90-day-delinquency rate was 43 basis points lower at 1.75 percent.
