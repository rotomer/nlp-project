Morgan Stanley Reports First Quarter Results
Record Net Revenues of $8.5 Billion, Up 24%;
Record Revenues in Institutional Securities, Fixed Income, Prime Brokerage, Discover
NEW YORK, March 22, 2006 -- Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported net income for the first quarter ended February 28, 2006 of $1,636 million, up 17 percent from the first quarter of 2005. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) were a record $8.5 billion, 24 percent above last years first quarter. Non-interest expenses of $6.0 billion represented a 27 percent increase from last year, primarily resulting from increased compensation costs. Diluted earnings per share were $1.54 compared with $1.29 in the first quarter of 2005 and the annualized return on average common equity for the first quarter was 22.1 percent compared with 19.7 percent a year ago. Excluding the $395
million

of incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement-eligible employees under SFAS 123R discussed below, net income, diluted earnings per share and annualized return on average common equity would have been $1,901 million, $1.79 and 25.7 percent, respectively.

These costs were allocated to the business segments as follows: Institutional Securities, $270 million; Global Wealth Management Group, $80 million; Asset Management, $28 million; and Discover, $17 million.

John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, Morgan Stanley took advantage of a strong market environment in the first quarter to generate record net revenues and a 22 percent ROE, and we see substantial opportunities to further improve our performance.
 
We are directing resources, capital and people to areas in the institutional securities businesses where we see the most attractive opportunities, such as emerging markets, leveraged finance, derivatives, principal investments and mortgages.  In our retail and asset management businesses, we are making the necessary changes and investments to fully leverage those franchises.  And in our Discover credit card business, we are pursuing growth opportunities in the international and payments businesses.  We still have a great deal of work to do, and the results of these efforts will not flow to the bottom line all at once.  But we are making progress and we remain intensely focused on improving our growth, profitability and return on equity.
 
As previously announced, the results reflect the incremental compensation expense required by SFAS 123R for equity awards granted in the quarter to retirement-eligible employees. This $395 million expense relates to both 2005 fiscal year-end and other awards, including sign-ons, granted in the quarter and increases the compensation to net revenue ratio for the quarter by 4.7 percentage points.

Additionally, based on recent interpretive guidance related to SFAS 123R, the Company has changed its accounting policy for expensing the cost of equity awards granted to retirement-eligible employees. The Company will accrue the estimated cost of these awards over the course of the current fiscal year rather than expensing the awards at the time of grant in December. As a result, the quarter includes an accrual of $139 million

for the estimated cost of fiscal 2006 year-end awards that will be granted to retirement-eligible employees.

of $1,754 million, up 63 percent from $1,077 million in the first quarter of 2005. Record net revenues of $5.5 billion were 36 percent higher, driven by record results in the Companys fixed income business and strong results in equities and investment banking. The quarters pre-tax margin was 32 percent, compared with 27 percent in last years first quarter. Excluding the incremental compensation expense noted above, last years legal and regulatory charges and the lease accounting adjustment expense,

the pre-tax margin would have been approximately 37 percent in both periods.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset Managements pre-tax income was $172 million, a 40 percent decrease from $287 million in the first quarter of 2005, which included the World Trade Center insurance settlement.

The quarters pre-tax margin was 25 percent compared with 41 percent a year ago, or 35 percent excluding the World Trade Center insurance settlement. Net revenues were flat compared with the first quarter of 2005 as an increase in revenues from higher assets under management was offset by lower private equity revenues. Non-interest expenses increased 28 percent to $523 million, reflecting the $28 million incremental compensation expense noted above and the World Trade Center insurance settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding results from the private equity business, the incremental compensation expense noted above and last years World Trade Center insurance settlement, pre-tax income declined 2 percent, and the pre-tax margin was 29 percent compared with 32 percent last year.
Assets under management or supervision at February 28, 2006 were $442 billion, up $15 billion, or 4 percent, from a year ago. The increase resulted from market appreciation partly offset by customer out-flows. Institutional assets rose $15 billion during the first quarter and $21 billion over the past 12 months to $247 billion. Retail assets declined $4 billion during the quarter and $6 billion from a year ago to $195 billion. The percent of the Companys long-term fund assets performing in the top half of the Lipper rankings was 60 percent over one year, 61 percent over three years, 76 percent over five years and 82 percent over 10 years.

DISCOVER
Discovers first quarter pre-tax income was a record $479 million on a managed basis, up 35 percent from $354 million in the first quarter of 2005. The quarters pre-tax margin was 44 percent compared with 37 percent a year ago. Net revenues of $1,089 million were 14 percent higher than last years first quarter. The positive change reflects an increase in the valuation of the Companys residual interests in securitized receivables and a reduction in the provision for consumer loan losses, both resulting from a favorable impact on charge-offs following federal bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005. The results for the quarter also reflect higher gains on new securitizations.
As of February 28, 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 20 million shares of its common stock since the end of fiscal 2005. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.27 quarterly dividend per common share.
