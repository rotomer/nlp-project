Morgan Stanley Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Record Full Year Results From Continuing Operations
Achieves Best Year Ever in Revenues, Net Income and EPS
Announces Plan to Spin-Off Discover
 
NEW YORK, December 19, 2006 - Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported record income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2006. In addition, the Board of Directors has approved the spin-off of Discover in order to enhance shareholder value. The Firm achieved record income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006 of $7,497 million, a 44 percent increase from $5,192 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $7.09 compared with $4.81 last year. Record net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) of $33.9 billion were 26 percent higher than last year. Non-interest expenses of $22.9 billion were 18 percent above 2005. Compensation expenses increased 27 percent primarily reflecting higher revenues. Non-compensation expenses increased 5 percent as costs associated with higher levels of business activity were partly offset by lower charges for legal and regulatory matters.  Results for the current year include an income tax benefit of $280 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, resulting from the outcome of a federal tax audit, while the prior year included a tax benefit of $309 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, related to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The return on average common equity from continuing operations was 23.6 percent compared with 19.0 percent a year ago. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was a record $2,206 million, an increase of 26 percent from $1,746 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $2.08 compared with $1.64 a year ago. Net revenues were $8.6 billion, 24 percent above last years fourth quarter. Non-interest expenses of $5.8 billion increased 19 percent from last year. The results for the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005 include the $0.27 and $0.29 per diluted share tax benefits noted above. The annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 26.0 percent in the current quarter, compared with 24.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.

John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, 2006 was a year of outstanding performance and progress for Morgan Stanley.  Capitalizing on a strong market environment, the people of Morgan Stanley achieved record fourth quarter results and the best full-year revenues and earnings in the Firms history. In our securities business, we delivered powerful performance across our Institutional Securities franchise and made significant strides in our Asset Management and Global Wealth Management businesses. Discover also achieved record results this year and made substantial progress in executing critical growth initiatives.
 
Mr. Mack continued, Given the record results and significant momentum both in our securities business and our cards and payments business, we have concluded, after our most recent strategic review, that they can best execute their growth strategies as two stand-alone, well-capitalized companies with independent boards of directors focused on creating shareholder value. The spin-off will allow Discover to continue building on its strong brand and significant scale. We also believe the spin-off will unlock considerable value for the shareholders of Morgan Stanley.
 
Mr. Mack concluded, Thanks to the hard work and commitment of Morgan Stanleys employees, we have now delivered five straight quarters with an ROE above 20 percent. While there is still room for improvement in many of our businesses, the investments we have made - and the significant strategic steps we have taken - will position Morgan Stanley and Discover for continued success as each focuses intensely on accelerating growth and creating additional shareholder value.

Non-interest expenses rose 23 percent from the prior year to $13.4 billion primarily due to increased compensation costs resulting from higher revenues. Non-compensation expenses increased modestly as costs associated with higher levels of business activity were offset by significantly lower charges for legal and regulatory matters.

Fixed income sales and trading revenues were a record $9.6 billion, up 41 percent from 2005. The increase was driven by record results in commodities, credit products and interest rate & currency products. Commodities generated strong results in electricity, natural gas and oil liquids. Credit products benefited from significantly improved corporate credit trading and strength in residential and commercial securitized products. Both commodities and interest rate & currency products benefited from revenues recognized on structured transactions as a result of increased visibility of market value.
 
Equity
sales and trading revenues were a record $6.3 billion, a 32 percent increase from the prior year. The increase was broad based, with strength in derivatives and cash markets on higher market volumes, particularly in Europe and Asia, and strong trading results. Financing products had higher revenues resulting from increased client activity and Prime Brokerage achieved record results due to robust growth in client asset balances.
 
Principal investment gains were $1,477 million for the year compared with $656 million in 2005. Significant gains resulted from the Companys interest in real estate funds, IntercontinentalExchange, Grifols S.A., NYSE Group, Inc. and Wacker Chemie AG.

GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP
FULL YEAR
Global Wealth Management reported pre-tax income of $509 million, down 13 percent from last years $585 million, which included a benefit of $198 million resulting from the World Trade Center insurance settlement, partly offset by a lease accounting adjustment of $29 million. Excluding these items, pre-tax income increased 22 percent from last year, as investment in the business and increased productivity resulted in progressive improvement throughout 2006. Net revenues of $5.5 billion were up 10 percent from 2005 driven by higher net interest revenue from the bank deposit sweep program and an increase in revenues from fee-based products. Total non-interest expenses were up 13 percent from a year ago to $5.0 billion. Excluding the World Trade Center settlement and lease accounting adjustment noted above, total non-interest expenses were up 9 percent. The increase was driven by higher compensation costs primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by lower non-compensation expenses because of lower charges for legal and regulatory matters and improved cost discipline across the business. The years pre-tax margin was 9 percent compared with 12 percent in 2005 and the return on average common equity was 11 percent for both years.
 
FOURTH QUARTER
Global Wealth Management Groups pre-tax income for the fourth quarter was $171 million, up 104 percent compared with $84 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
FULL YEAR
Asset Managements pre-tax income was $711 million, a 29 percent decrease from last years $1,007 million.

Non-interest expenses increased 8 percent to $2.1 billion resulting from increased compensation costs. The years pre-tax margin was 26 percent compared with 35 percent a year ago. Full year return on average common equity was 19 percent, down from 36 percent in the prior year.
 
FOURTH QUARTER
Asset Management reported pre-tax income of $190 million, 50 percent lower than last year's $383 million.  The decline in pre-tax income reflected a 19 percent decline in net revenues to $718 million, driven by significantly lower investment revenues, principally in the private equity business, which declined from $227 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to $42 million in the current quarter. Higher management and administration fees, driven by higher assets under management, were partially offset by a decline in distribution and other fees. Non-interest expenses increased 4 percent to $528 million due to higher non-compensation expenses. The quarter's pre-tax margin was 27 percent compared with 43 percent a year ago and the return on average common equity was 18 percent compared with 55 percent in last years fourth quarter.
 
Assets under management or supervision at November 30, 2006 were $478 billion, up $47 billion, or 11 percent, from a year ago.

Discover reported record pre-tax income of $1,587 million on a managed basis, up 72 percent from $921 million last year. Record net revenues of $4.3 billion were 24 percent higher than 2005. The current years results benefited from improvements in underlying credit quality and lower bankruptcies following last falls spike in bankruptcy filings resulting from federal bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005. Non-interest expenses increased 7 percent to $2.7 billion, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses associated with the Goldfish credit card
business and higher legal costs and compensation expenses. The managed credit card charge-off rate decreased 115 basis points from a year ago to 4.08 percent. The over-30-day delinquency rate decreased 47 basis points to 3.51 percent and the over-90-day delinquency rate was 10 basis points lower at 1.65 percent.

OTHER MATTERS
Excluding the benefit for the American Jobs Creation Act in 2005 and the outcome of the federal tax audit in 2006, the annual effective tax rates for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 would have been 30.8 percent and 33.0 percent, respectively. The increase in the tax rate compared with the prior year primarily reflected lower domestic tax credits partially offset by the effects of lower tax rates applicable to non-U.S. earnings.
The quarters results reflect a decrease in the Companys annual effective tax rate from 33.5 percent in the third quarter to 30.4 percent, resulting from the outcome of the federal tax audit and an increase in domestic tax credits.
