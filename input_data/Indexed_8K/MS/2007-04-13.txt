(c)
      
Calculation of Shares Available for Delivery
. In calculating the number of Shares that remain available for delivery pursuant to Awards at any time, the following rules shall apply (subject to the limitation in Section 4(e)):
1.
     
The number of Shares available for delivery shall be reduced by the number of Shares subject to an Award and, in the case of an Award that is not denominated in Shares, the number of Shares actually delivered upon payment or settlement of the Award.
2.
     
The number of Shares tendered (by actual delivery or attestation) or withheld from an Award to pay the exercise price of the Award or to satisfy any tax withholding obligation or liability of a Participant shall be added back to the number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards.
3.
     
The number of Shares in respect of any portion of an Award that is canceled or that expires without having been paid or settled by the Company shall be added back to the number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards to the extent such Shares were counted against the Shares available for delivery pursuant to clause (1).
4.
     
If an Award is settled or paid by the Company in whole or in part through the delivery of consideration other than Shares, or by delivery of fewer than the full number of Shares that was counted against the Shares available for delivery pursuant to clause (1), there shall be added back to the number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards the excess of the number of Shares that had been so counted over the number of Shares (if any) actually delivered upon payment or settlement of the Award.
5.
     
Any Shares underlying Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards and shall not be subject to Section 4(d).
(d)
      
Individual Limit on Options and SARs
. The maximum number of Shares that may be subject to Options or SARs granted to or elected by a Participant in any fiscal year shall be 2,000,000 Shares. The limitation imposed by this Section 4(d) shall not include Options or SARs granted to a Participant pursuant to Section 162(m) Performance Goals.
(e)
      
ISO Limit
. The full number of Shares available for delivery under the Plan may be delivered pursuant to Incentive Stock Options, except that in calculating the number of Shares that remain available for Awards of Incentive Stock Options the rules set forth in Section 4(c) shall not apply to the extent not permitted by Section 422 of the Code.
(a)
      
Committee Authority Generally
. The Committee shall administer the Plan and shall have full power and authority to make all determinations under the Plan, subject to the express provisions hereof, including without limitation: (i) to select Participants from among the Eligible Individuals; (ii) to make Awards; (iii) to determine the number of Shares subject to each Award or the cash amount payable in connection with an Award; (iv) to establish the terms and conditions of each Award, including, without limitation, those related to vesting, cancellation, payment, exercisability, and the effect, if any, of certain events on a Participant's Awards, such as the Participant's termination of employment with the Company; (v) to specify and approve the
 
 
 
 
provisions of the Award Documents delivered to Participants in connection with their Awards; (vi) to construe and interpret any Award Document delivered under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and procedures relating to the Plan; (viii) to make all determinations necessary or advisable in administering the Plan and Awards, including without limitation determinations as to whether (and if so as of what date) a Participant has commenced, or has experienced a termination of, employment; (ix) to vary the terms of Awards to take account of securities law and other legal or regulatory requirements of jurisdictions in which Participants work or reside or to procure favorable tax treatment for Participants; and (x) to formulate such procedures as it considers to be necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
(b)
      
Delegation
. To the extent not prohibited by applicable laws or rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Committee may from time to time delegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to one or more Administrators consisting of one or more members of the Committee as a subcommittee or subcommittees thereof or of one or more members of the Board who are not members of the Committee or one or more officers of the Company (or of any combination of such persons). Any such delegation shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Committee specifies at the time of such delegation or thereafter. The Committee may at any time rescind all or part of the authority delegated to an Administrator or appoint a new Administrator. At all times, an Administrator appointed under this Section 5(b) shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Committee. Any action undertaken by an Administrator in accordance with the Committee's delegation of authority shall have the same force and effect as if undertaken directly by the Committee, and any reference in the Plan to the Committee shall, to the extent consistent with the terms and limitations of such delegation, be deemed to include a reference to an Administrator.
(c)
      
Authority to Construe and Interpret
. The Committee shall have full power and authority, subject to the express provisions hereof, to construe and interpret the Plan.
(d)
      
Committee Discretion
. All of the Committee's determinations in carrying out, administering, construing and interpreting the Plan shall be made or taken in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons. In the event of any disagreement between the Committee and an Administrator, the Committee's determination on such matter shall be final and binding on all interested persons, including any Administrator. The Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by it selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards under the Plan (whether or not such persons are similarly situated). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall be entitled, among other things, to make non-uniform and selective determinations, and to enter into non-uniform and selective Award Documents, as to the persons receiving Awards under the Plan, and the terms and provisions of Awards under the Plan.
(e)
      
No Liability
. Subject to applicable law: (i) no member of the Committee or any Administrator shall be liable for anything whatsoever in connection with the exercise of authority under the Plan or the administration of the Plan except such person's own willful misconduct; (ii) under no circumstances shall any member of the Committee or any Administrator be liable for any act or omission of any other member of the Committee or an Administrator; and (iii) in the performance of its functions with respect to the Plan, the
 
 
 
 
Committee and an Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon information and advice furnished by the Company's officers, the Company's accountants, the Company's counsel and any other party the Committee or the Administrator deems necessary, and no member of the Committee or any Administrator shall be liable for any action taken or not taken in good faith reliance upon any such advice.
6.
        
Eligibility.
Eligible Individuals shall include all officers, other employees (including prospective employees) and consultants of, and other persons who perform services for, the Company, non-employee directors of Subsidiaries and employees and consultants of joint ventures, partnerships or similar business organizations in which Morgan Stanley or a Subsidiary has an equity or similar interest. Any Award made to a prospective employee shall be conditioned upon, and effective not earlier than, such person's becoming an employee. Members of the Board who are not Company employees will not be eligible to receive Awards under the Plan. An individual's status as an Administrator will not affect his or her eligibility to receive Awards under the Plan.
7.
        
Restricted Stock.
An Award of Restricted Stock shall be subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee in connection with the Award and specified in the applicable Award Document. Restricted Stock may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transfer, vesting requirements or cancellation under specified circumstances.
8.
        
Stock Units.
An Award of Stock Units shall be subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee in connection with the Award and specified in the applicable Award Document. Each Stock Unit awarded to a Participant shall correspond to one Share. Upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Award, a Stock Unit will be payable, at the discretion of the Committee, in Stock or in cash equal to the Fair Market Value on the payment date of one Share. As a holder of Stock Units, a Participant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of Morgan Stanley. A Participant shall not be a stockholder with respect to the Shares underlying Stock Units unless and until the Stock Units convert to Shares. Stock Units may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transfer, vesting requirements or cancellation under specified circumstances.
(a)
      
Options Generally
. An Award of Options shall be subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee in connection with the Award and specified in the applicable Award Document. The Committee shall establish (or shall authorize the method for establishing) the exercise price of all Options awarded under the Plan, except that the exercise price of an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the Award Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price of an Option that is a Substitute Award may be less than the Fair Market Value per Share on the Award Date, provided that such substitution complies with applicable laws and regulations, including the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and Section 409A or Section 424, as applicable, of the Code. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to exercisability of the Award, a Participant shall be entitled to exercise the Options included in the Award and to have delivered, upon Morgan Stanley's receipt of payment of the exercise price and completion of any other conditions or procedures specified by Morgan Stanley, the number of Shares in respect of which the Options shall have
 
 
 
 
been exercised. Options may be either nonqualified stock options or Incentive Stock Options. Options and the Shares acquired upon exercise of Options may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transfer, vesting requirements or cancellation under specified circumstances.
(b)
      
Prohibition on Restoration Option Grants
. Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, the terms of an Option shall not provide that a new Option will be granted, automatically and without additional consideration in excess of the exercise price of the underlying Option, to a Participant upon exercise of the Option.
(c)
      
Prohibition on Repricing of Options and SARs
. Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may not reprice any Option or SAR. "Reprice" means any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (i) amending an Option or SAR to reduce its exercise price, (ii) canceling an Option or SAR at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of one Share in exchange for an Option, SAR, Restricted Stock, Stock Unit or other equity award, unless the cancellation or exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction; or (iii) taking any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles;
provided, however
, that adjustments pursuant to Section 4(b) shall not be deemed to be a repricing that is prohibited by this Section 9(c).
(d)
      
Payment of Exercise Price
. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award Document and to the extent authorized by rules and procedures of Morgan Stanley from time to time, the exercise price of the Option may be paid in cash, by actual delivery or attestation to ownership of freely transferable Shares already owned by the person exercising the Option, or by such other means as Morgan Stanley may authorize.
(e)
      
Maximum Term on Stock Options and SARs
. No Option or SAR shall have an expiration date that is later than the tenth anniversary of the Award Date thereof.
10.
     
SARs.
An Award of SARs shall be subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee in connection with the Award and specified in the applicable Award Document. The Committee shall establish (or shall authorize the method for establishing) the exercise price of all SARs awarded under the Plan, except that the exercise price of a SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the Award Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price of any SAR that is a Substitute Award may be less than the Fair Market Value of one Share on the Award Date, subject to the same conditions set forth in Section 9(a) for Options that are Substitute Awards. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to the payment of the Award, each SAR shall entitle a Participant to an amount, if any, equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise over the SAR exercise price specified in the applicable Award Document. At the discretion of the Committee, payments to a Participant upon exercise of an SAR may be made in Shares, cash or a combination thereof. SARs and the Shares that may be acquired upon exercise of SARs may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transfer, vesting requirements or cancellation under specified circumstances.
11.
     
Other Awards.
The Committee shall have the authority to establish the terms and provisions of other forms of equity-based or equity-related Awards (such terms and provisions to be specified in the applicable Award Document) not described above that the Committee
 
 
 
 
determines to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan and the interests of the Company, which Awards may provide for (i) cash or Stock payments based in whole or in part on the value or future value of Stock or on any amount that Morgan Stanley pays as dividends or otherwise distributes with respect to Stock, (ii) the acquisition or future acquisition of Stock, (iii) cash or Stock payments (including payment of dividend equivalents in cash or Stock) based on one or more criteria determined by the Committee unrelated to the value of Stock, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. Awards pursuant to this Section 11 may, among other things, be made subject to restrictions on transfer, vesting requirements or cancellation under specified circumstances.
(a)
      
Awards in General
. Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be made in substitution in whole or in part for cash or other compensation payable to an Eligible Individual. In accordance with rules and procedures authorized by the Committee, an Eligible Individual may elect one form of Award in lieu of any other form of Award, or may elect to receive an Award in lieu of all or part of any compensation that otherwise might have been paid to such Eligible Individual;
provided
,
however
, that any such election shall not require the Committee to make any Award to such Eligible Individual. Any such substitute or elective Awards shall have terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan applicable to such Award. Awards may be granted in tandem with, or independent of, other Awards. The grant, vesting or payment of an Award may, among other things, be conditioned on the attainment of performance objectives, including without limitation objectives based in whole or in part on net income, pre-tax income, return on equity, earnings per share, total shareholder return or book value per share.
(b)
      
Discretionary Awards
. All grants of Awards and deliveries of Shares, cash or other property under the Plan shall constitute a special discretionary incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be required to be taken into account in computing the amount of salary, wages or other compensation of the Participant for the purpose of determining any contributions to or any benefits under any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus, life insurance, severance or other benefit plan of the Company or other benefits from the Company or under any agreement with the Participant, unless Morgan Stanley specifically provides otherwise.
(c)
      
Dividends and Distributions
. If Morgan Stanley pays any dividend or makes any distribution to holders of Stock, the Committee may in its discretion authorize payments (which may be in cash, Stock (including Restricted Stock) or Stock Units or a combination thereof) with respect to the Shares corresponding to an Award, or may authorize appropriate adjustments to outstanding Awards, to reflect such dividend or distribution. The Committee may make any such payments subject to vesting, deferral, restrictions on transfer or other conditions.
(d)
      
Deferrals
. In accordance with the procedures authorized by, and subject to the approval of, the Committee, Participants may be given the opportunity to defer the payment or settlement of an Award to one or more dates selected by the Participant.
(e)
      
Award Documentation and Award Terms
. The terms and conditions of an Award shall be set forth in an Award Document authorized by the Committee. The Award Document shall include any vesting, exercisability, payment and other restrictions applicable to an Award (which
 
 
 
 
may include, without limitation, the effects of termination of employment, cancellation of the Award under specified circumstances, restrictions on transfer or provision for mandatory resale to the Company).
(f)
      
Awards to Section 162(m) Participants
. Except for Options and SARs the shares underlying which are counted against the individual limit set forth in Section 4(d), all Awards to Section 162(m) Participants shall be made pursuant to the attainment of Section 162(m) Performance Goals as certified by the Committee in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. Without any further action by the Board or the Committee, this Section 12(f) shall cease to apply on the effective date of the repeal of Section 162(m) of the Code (and any successor provision thereto).
(a)
      
Stockholder Rights.
No Participant (or other persons having rights pursuant to an Award) shall have any of the rights of a stockholder of Morgan Stanley with respect to Shares subject to an Award until the delivery of the Shares, which shall be effected by entry of the Participant's (or other person's) name in the share register of Morgan Stanley or by such other procedure as may be authorized by Morgan Stanley. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(b) or 12(c), no adjustments shall be made for dividends or distributions on, or other events relating to, Shares subject to an Award for which the record date is prior to the date such Shares are delivered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of an Employee Trust may authorize some or all Participants to give voting or tendering instructions to the trustee thereof in respect of Shares that are held in such Employee Trust and are subject to Awards. Except for the risk of cancellation and the restrictions on transfer that may apply to certain Shares (including restrictions relating to any dividends or other rights) or as otherwise set forth in the applicable Award Document, the Participant shall be the beneficial owner of any Shares delivered to the Participant in connection with an Award and, upon such delivery shall be entitled to all rights of ownership, including, without limitation, the right to vote the Shares and to receive cash dividends or other dividends (whether in Shares, other securities or other property) thereon.
(b)
      
Transferability
. No Award granted under the Plan shall be transferable, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided that, except with respect to Incentive Stock Options, the Committee may permit transfers on such terms and conditions as it shall determine. During the lifetime of a Participant to whom Incentive Stock Options were awarded, such Incentive Stock Options shall be exercisable only by the Participant.
14.
     
Representation; Compliance with Law.
The Committee may condition the grant, exercise, settlement or retention of any Award on the Participant making any representations required in the applicable Award Document. Each Award shall also be conditioned upon the making of any filings and the receipt of any consents or authorizations required to comply with, or required to be obtained under, applicable law.
 
 
 
 
(a)
      
Satisfaction of Obligations
. As a condition to the making or retention of any Award, the vesting, exercise or payment of any Award or the lapse of any restrictions pertaining thereto, Morgan Stanley may require a Participant to pay such sum to the Company as may be necessary to discharge the Company's obligations with respect to any taxes, assessments or other governmental charges (including FICA and other social security or similar tax) imposed on property or income received by a Participant pursuant to the Plan or to satisfy any obligation that the Participant owes to the Company. In accordance with rules and procedures authorized by Morgan Stanley, (i) such payment may be in the form of cash or other property, and (ii) in satisfaction of such taxes, assessments or other governmental charges or of other obligations that a Participant owes to the Company, Morgan Stanley may make available for delivery a lesser number of Shares in payment or settlement of an Award, may withhold from any payment or distribution of an Award, may permit a Participant to tender previously owned Shares, or may enter into any other suitable arrangements to satisfy such withholding or other obligation.
(b)
      
No Right to Continued Employment
. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall give rise to any right on the part of any Participant to continue in the employ of the Company.
(c)
      
Headings
. The headings of sections herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning of any of the provisions of the Plan.
(d)
      
Governing Law
. The Plan and all rights hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflicts or choice of law, rule or principle that might otherwise refer the interpretation of the award to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.
(e)
      
Amendments and Termination
. The Board or Committee may modify, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part at any time and may modify or amend the terms and conditions of any outstanding Award (including by amending or supplementing the relevant Award Document at any time); provided, however, that no such modification, amendment, suspension or termination shall, without a Participant's consent, materially adversely affect that Participant's rights with respect to any Award previously made; and provided, further, that the Committee shall have the right at any time, without a Participant's consent and whether or not the Participant's rights are materially adversely affected thereby, to amend or modify the Plan or any Award under the Plan in any manner that the Committee considers necessary or advisable to comply with any law, regulation, ruling, judicial decision, accounting standards, regulatory guidance or other legal requirement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, neither the Board nor the Committee may accelerate the payment or settlement of any Award, including, without limitation, any Award subject to a prior deferral election, that constitutes a deferral of compensation for purposes of Section 409A except to the extent such acceleration would not result in the Participant incurring interest or additional tax under Section 409A. No amendment to the Plan may render any Board member who is not a Company employee eligible to receive an Award at any time while such member is serving on the Board. To the extent required by applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, amendments to the Plan shall not be effective unless they are approved by Morgan Stanley's stockholders.
