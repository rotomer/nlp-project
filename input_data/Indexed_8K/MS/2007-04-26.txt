This debenture is one of a duly authorized issue of 6.45% Junior Subordinated Debentures due April 15, 2067 (the 
Final Maturity Date
), and redeemable on such earlier date or dates as provided herein, of the Issuer (the 
Debentures
). The Debentures are issuable under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of October 12, 2006, between Morgan Stanley (the 
Issuer
) and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the 
Trustee
, which term includes any successor trustee under the Junior Subordinated Indenture) (the 
Junior Subordinated Indenture
), to which Junior Subordinated Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Issuer, the Trustee and holders of the Debentures and the terms upon which the Debentures are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Issuer has appointed The Bank of New York at its corporate trust office in The City of New York as the paying agent (the 
Paying Agent
, which term includes any additional or successor Paying Agent appointed by the Issuer) with respect to the Debentures. To the extent not inconsistent herewith, the terms of the Junior Subordinated Indenture are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning given to such terms in the Junior Subordinated Indenture.
 
This Debenture shall not be subject to any sinking fund, shall not be subject to repayment at the option of the holder and, except as provided below, shall not be redeemable prior to the Final Maturity Date.
 
The Issuer covenants (the 
Replacement Capital Obligation
) to redeem the Debentures on January 15, 2046 (the 
Scheduled Redemption Date
), but only out of net proceeds raised from the sale to third party purchasers of one or more issuances of Replacement Securities in the amounts specified below.
 
The Replacement Capital Obligation is limited. Except as described below, and subject to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, the Issuer shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds from the sale of Replacement Securities to redeem the Debentures in full on the Scheduled Redemption Date only to the extent that it has raised sufficient net proceeds within the 180-day period prior to the date on which the Issuer gives its notice of redemption pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, which shall be not more than 30 and not less than 15 days prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date. If the Issuer has not raised sufficient net proceeds to permit redemption in full of the Debentures on the Scheduled Redemption Date at their principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, it shall apply any available proceeds so raised first to pay the accrued and unpaid installments of interest in chronological order and second to repay all principal outstanding on the Debentures. Except as described below, and subject to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, the Issuer shall continue using its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient
 
4
proceeds to permit repayment of the balance of the amount due on the Debentures as soon as commercially practicable and shall use any proceeds raised on each Interest Payment Date following the Scheduled Redemption Date to reduce the balance outstanding on such Interest Payment Date until the Debentures are paid in full. The Issuer shall not otherwise redeem the Debentures on or after the Scheduled Redemption Date. The Replacement Capital Obligation shall continue to apply until (i) the Issuer has raised sufficient net proceeds from the sale of Replacement Securities to permit redemption in full in accordance with the Replacement Capital Obligation, (ii) the Debentures are otherwise paid in full on the Final Maturity Date or (iii) the occurrence of an Event of Default resulting in the acceleration of the principal amount of the Debentures.
 
The Issuer shall only have the right to modify or terminate the Replacement Capital Obligation with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures;
provided
that the Replacement Capital Obligation may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Issuer (and without the consent of the Holders) if: (i) such amendment eliminates Common Stock, Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Debt Exchangeable for Equity (but only to the extent exchangeable for Common Stock) as a type of security or securities qualifying as Replacement Securities and the Issuer has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to do so would result in a reduction in the Issuers earnings per share as calculated for financial reporting purposes or (ii) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders then in effect or imposes additional restrictions on the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Securities, and, in either case described in this clause (ii), an officer of the Issuer has delivered to the Holders a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders. In no event, however, shall the Issuers failure to obtain such consent be an Event of Default hereunder.
 
Any principal amount of this Debenture remaining outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date, regardless of the amount of Replacement Securities the Issuer has issued and sold by that time.
 
Commercially Reasonable Efforts
 to sell securities in accordance with the Replacement Capital Obligation or the Alternative Payment Mechanism means commercially reasonable efforts by the Issuer to complete the offer and sale of the Issuers securities to third parties that are not Subsidiaries of the Issuer in public offerings or private placements. The Issuer shall not be considered to have made commercially reasonable efforts to effect a sale of securities if it determines to not pursue or complete such sale due to pricing, coupon, dividend rate or dilution considerations.
 
5
The Issuer shall not be required to redeem the Debentures on the Scheduled Redemption Date or any Interest Payment Date following the Scheduled Redemption Date, as the case may be (each a 
Required Repayment Date
), to the extent it provides written certification to the Trustee no more than 30 and no less than 15 days in advance of the Required Repayment Date certifying that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of such certificate or, in the case of any required redemption after the Scheduled Redemption Date, the 90-day period preceding the date of such certificate and (ii) either (a) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or 90-day period, as the case may be, or (b) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period, but the Issuer was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the rest of such period to permit redemption of the Debentures in full.
 
Net proceeds that the Issuer is permitted to apply to redemption of the Debentures on and after the Scheduled Redemption Date shall be applied first to pay Deferred Interest to the extent of eligible proceeds raised under the Alternative Payment Mechanism, second to pay current interest that the Issuer is not paying from other sources and third to redeem the principal of the Debentures, subject to a minimum principal amount of US$5,000,000 to be redeemed on any Required Repayment Date;
provided
that if the Issuer is obligated to sell Replacement Securities in accordance with the Replacement Capital Obligation and apply the net proceeds to payments of principal of or interest on any outstanding securities in addition to the Debentures (the 
Other Securities
), then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from such sales and available for such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and the Other Securities having the same scheduled repayment date or scheduled redemption date as the Debentures pro rata in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts, and none of such net proceeds shall be applied to any Other Securities having a later scheduled repayment date or scheduled redemption date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures has been paid in full.

11
Issuer can do so and still satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under the securities and derivative instruments that provide for settlement or payment in shares of Common Stock, and (B) if the Issuer cannot increase the maximum issuance cap as contemplated in the preceding clause, to request its Board of Directors to adopt a resolution for shareholder vote at the next occurring annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of shares of the Issuers authorized Common Stock for purposes of satisfying its obligations to pay deferred distributions;

(iv)
 
if the Issuer has outstanding more than one class or series of securities under which it is obligated to sell a type of APM Qualifying Securities and apply some part of the proceeds to the payment of deferred Distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for payment of deferred Distributions on such securities shall be applied to such securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap and any maximum issuance cap referred to above, as applicable, in proportion to the total amounts that are due on such securities, or on such other basis as an Applicable Governmental Authority may approve.

require, or at its option in the case of Qualifying Preferred Stock permit, the issuer of such Qualifying Capital Securities to make payment of Distributions on such securities only pursuant to the issue and sale of APM Qualifying Securities, within two years of a failure of the issuer to satisfy one or more financial tests set forth in the terms of such Qualifying Capital Securities or related transaction agreements, in an amount such that the net proceeds of such sale are at least equal to the amount of unpaid Distributions on such Qualifying Capital Securities (including without limitation all deferred and accumulated amounts), and in either case require the application of the net proceeds of such sale to pay such unpaid Distributions,
provided
that (A) such Mandatory Trigger Provision shall limit the issuance and sale of Common Stock and Qualifying Warrants the proceeds of which may be applied to pay such Distributions
pursuant to such provision to the Common Cap, unless the Mandatory Trigger Provision requires such issuance and sale within one year of such failure, and (B) the amount of Qualifying Preferred Stock the net proceeds of which the issuer may apply to pay such Distributions pursuant to such provision may not exceed the Preferred Cap;

other than in the case of Qualifying Preferred Stock, if the provisions described in clause (i) do not require such issuance and sale within one year of such failure, prohibit the issuer from repurchasing any securities that are
pari passu
with or junior to its APM Qualifying Securities, the proceeds of which were used to pay deferred Distributions since such failure before the date six months after the Issuer applies the net proceeds of the sales described in clause (i) to pay such unpaid Distributions in full; and
 
(iii)
 
other than in the case of Qualifying Preferred Stock, include a Bankruptcy Claim Limitation Provision;
 
provided
(and it being understood) that:
 
(i)
 
the Issuer will not be obligated to issue (or use commercially reasonably efforts to issue) any such APM Qualifying Securities for so long as a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing;
 
(ii)
 
if, due to a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the Issuer is able to raise and apply some, but not all, of the eligible proceeds necessary to pay all deferred Distributions on any Distribution Date, the Issuer will apply any available eligible proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid Distributions on the applicable Distribution Date in chronological order subject to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap and any maximum issuance cap, as applicable; and
 
(iii)
 
if the Issuer has outstanding more than one class or series of securities under which it is obligated to sell a type of any such APM Qualifying Securities and applies some part of the proceeds to the payment of deferred Distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for payment of deferred Distributions on such securities shall be applied to such securities on a
pro rata
basis up to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap, and any maximum issuance cap, as applicable, in proportion to the total amounts that are due on such securities.
 
No remedy other than Permitted Remedies will arise by the terms of such securities or related transaction agreements in favor of the holders of such securities as a result of the Issuers failure to pay Distributions because of the Mandatory Trigger Provision until Distributions have been deferred for one or more Distribution Periods that total together at least ten years.

provided
that such Alternative Payment Mechanism need not apply during the first five years of any deferral period and need not include a Common Cap, Preferred Cap, Bankruptcy Claim Limitation Provision or Repurchase Restriction); or

Qualifying Warrants
 means net share settled warrants to purchase Common Stock that have an exercise price greater than the Current Stock Market Price of the Issuers Common Stock as of their date of issuance, that do not entitle the Issuer to redeem for cash and the holders of such warrants are not entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase for cash in any circumstance.

Redemption Price
).
 
In addition, subject to obtaining any then required regulatory approval, the Issuer may redeem Debentures at the Early Redemption Price on any date (such date, the 
Early Redemption Date

Comparable Treasury Price
 means, with respect to an Early Redemption Date (i) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Early Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Premium Calculation Agent obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer

The Issuer will notify the Issuer Trust of the Redemption Price or Early Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Issuer Trust shall have no responsibility for calculating the Redemption Price or Early Redemption Price.
 
Notice of redemption shall be mailed to the registered Holders of the Debentures designated for redemption at their addresses as the same shall appear on the Debenture register not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the

Trust Agreement
), the opportunity to eliminate, within the 90-Day Period, the Tax Event or Investment Company Event by taking some ministerial action (
Ministerial Action
), such as filing a form or making an election, or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that shall have no adverse effect on the Issuer, the Issuer Trust or the holders of the Capital Securities and shall involve no material cost, the Issuer shall pursue such measures in lieu of redemption; provided further, that the Issuer shall have no right to redeem the Debentures while either it or the Issuer Trust is pursuing any Ministerial Action pursuant to the Trust Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the 90-Day Period shall not run during the undertaking of any such Ministerial Action by the Issuer or the Issuer Trust.
 
The Redemption Price or Early Redemption Price, as the case may be, shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such redemption or such earlier time as the Issuer determines; provided, that the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Redemption Price prior to the redemption date or the Early Redemption Price prior to the Early Redemption Date, as the case may be.
 
The term 
Tax Event
 means the receipt by the Issuer of an opinion of counsel to the Issuer experienced in such matters, who shall not be an officer or employee of the Issuer or any of its affiliates, to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or as a result of any official or administrative pronouncement or action or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or which pronouncement, action or decision is announced on or after April 19, 2007, there is more than an insubstantial risk that (i) the Issuer Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the delivery of such opinion, subject to United States federal income tax with respect to income received or accrued on the Debentures, (ii) interest payable by the Issuer to the Issuer Trust on the Debentures is not, or within 90 days of the delivery of such opinion will not be, deductible by the Issuer, in whole or in part, for United States federal income tax purposes or (iii) the Issuer Trust is, or shall be within 90 days of the delivery of the opinion, subject to more than a
de minimis
amount of other taxes, duties or other governmental charges.
22
 
Investment Company Event
 means the receipt by the Issuer of an opinion of counsel to the Issuer experienced in such matters, who shall not be an officer or employee of the Issuer or any of its affiliates, to the effect that, as a result of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or a written change (including any announced prospective change) in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Issuer Trust is or will be considered an investment company that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which change or prospective change becomes effective or would become effective, as the case may be, on or after April 19, 2007.
 
Regulatory Capital Event
 means the determination by the Issuer, based on the opinion of counsel experienced in such matters, who may be an employee of the Issuer or any of its affiliates, that as a result of: (i) any amendment to, clarification of or change (including any announced prospective change) in applicable laws or regulations or official interpretations thereof or policies with respect thereto or (ii) any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment, clarification, change, pronouncement or decision is effective or announced on or after April 19, 2007, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Capital Securities shall no longer constitute tier 1 (or its equivalent) capital of the Issuer or any holding company of which the Issuer is a subsidiary for the purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or policies of the SEC or any applicable regulatory body or governmental authority.
 
Rating Agency Event
means the determination by the Issuer that a change by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act that currently publishes a rating for Morgan Stanley (a 
Rating Agency
) in the equity credit criteria for securities such as the Capital Securities or the Debentures has occurred, resulting in a lower equity credit to the Issuer than the equity credit assigned by such Rating Agency to the Capital Securities or the Debentures on April 19, 2007.
 
Interest payments on this Debenture shall include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Dates or the Final Maturity Date (or any earlier redemption or repayment date), as the case may be. Interest payments for this Debenture shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual days elapsed in a partial month in such period. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date shall bear additional interest on the amount thereof at the rate per annum of 6.45% (the 
Coupon Rate
), compounded quarterly and computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual days elapsed in a partial month in such period. The amount of any interest payable for any full interest period shall be computed by dividing the rate per annum by four. The term interest as used
 
23
herein includes quarterly interest payments, interest on quarterly interest payments not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date and Additional Sums, as applicable.
 
If any Interest Payment Date or the Final Maturity Date (or any redemption date) does not fall on a Business Day, payment of interest, premium, if any, or principal otherwise payable on such date need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or on the Final Maturity Date (or any redemption date), and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or the Final Maturity Date (or any redemption date) to such next succeeding Business Day.
 
Section 5.01 of the Junior Subordinated Indenture provides that (i) if an Event of Default due to the default in payment of interest on any series of debt securities issued under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, including the series of Debentures of which this Debenture forms a part, shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) may then declare the principal of all debt securities of all such series and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately and (ii) if an Event of Default due to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization of the Issuer, shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all debt securities issued under the Junior Subordinated Indenture then outstanding (treated as one class) may declare the principal of all such debt securities and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, but upon certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past Defaults may be waived (except a continuing Default in payment of principal or interest on such debt securities) by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of all affected series then outstanding.
 
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, during the term of the Debentures to defer payments of interest for a period not exceeding 40 consecutive quarters (the 
Optional Deferral Period
), during which Optional Deferral Period no interest shall be due and payable;
provided
, that no Optional Deferral Period may extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the acceleration of the principal of the Debentures following an Event of Default. Interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of an Optional Deferral Period, shall bear interest thereon at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly for each quarter of the Optional Deferral Period and computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual days elapsed in a partial month in such period (
Additional Interest
). The Coupon Rate payable for any full interest period shall be computed by dividing the rate per annum by four. At the end of
 
24
 the Optional Deferral Period, all interest accrued and unpaid on this Debenture, including any Additional Sums and Additional Interest (together, 
Deferred Interest
) shall become due and payable, and the Issuer shall pay such Deferred Interest to the Holders of this Debenture in whose names this Debenture is registered in the Securities Register on the Record Date with respect to the first Interest Payment Date after the end of the Optional Deferral Period. Before the termination of any Optional Deferral Period, the Issuer may further extend such period; provided, that such period together with all such further extensions thereof shall not exceed 40 consecutive quarters, or extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the acceleration of the principal of the Debentures following an Event of Default. In the event that any Debentures are called for redemption on a date prior to the end of an Optional Deferral Period, with respect to such Debentures, such Optional Deferral Period shall be deemed to end on such date or an earlier date determined by the Issuer, subject to the Issuers compliance with the Alternative Payment Mechanism. Upon the termination of any Optional Deferral Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Issuer may commence a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof, but the Issuer may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Optional Deferral Period.
 
If the Property Trustee (as defined in the Trust Agreement) is the only Holder of the Debentures at the time the Issuer selects an Optional Deferral Period, the Issuer shall give written notice to the Issuer Trustees (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of its selection of such Optional Deferral Period at least 15 Business Days prior to the date the Distributions (as defined in the Trust Agreement) on the Trust Securities (as defined in the Trust Agreement) would have been payable but for the election to begin such Optional Deferral Period.
 
If the Property Trustee is not the only Holder, or is not itself the Holder, of the Debentures at the time the Issuer selects an Optional Deferral Period, the Issuer shall give the Holders of the Debentures and the Trustee written notice of its selection of such Optional Deferral Period at least 10 Business Days before the earlier of the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the date the Issuer is required to give notice of the record or payment date of such interest payment to Holders of the Debentures.
 
In the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings described in Section 5.01(b) or (c) of the Junior Subordinated Indenture prior to the redemption or repayment of the Debentures, Holders of the Debentures shall only have a claim for, or right to receive, distributions with respect to Deferred Interest, including accrued interest on the deferred payments, to the extent such interest (including accrued interest on the deferred payments) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Optional Deferral Period for which interest has not been paid.
25
 
The Issuer covenants that it shall not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Issuers capital stock, (ii) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Issuer that rank
pari passu
in all respects with or junior in interest to the Debentures or (iii) make any guarantee payments on any guarantee of debt securities of any of the Issuers Subsidiaries if the guarantee ranks equal or junior to the Debentures (other than (A) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Issuer in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or (3) the issuance of capital stock of the Issuer (or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable Optional Deferral Period, (B) as a result of an exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Issuers capital stock (or any capital stock of a Subsidiary of the Issuer) for any class or series of the Issuers capital stock or of any class or series of the Issuers indebtedness for any class or series of the Issuers capital stock, (C) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Issuers capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, (e) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks
pari passu
with or junior to such stock, (f) payments under the Guarantee executed and delivered by the Issuer and The Bank of New York, as trustee, for the benefit of the holders of any Capital Securities, as amended from time to time (the 
Guarantee
) or (g) any payments, purchases or acquisitions in connection with any market-making transactions in the Issuers capital stock in the ordinary course of the Issuers or any of the Issuers affiliates business), if at such time the Issuer has given notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period as provided in the Junior
Subordinated Indenture and has not rescinded such notice, or such Optional Deferral Period, or any extension thereof, is continuing.
 
If any Optional Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, unless required to do so by any Applicable Government Authority and subject to the exceptions listed in the parenthetical in the preceding paragraph, the Issuer shall not repurchase any of its Common Stock for a one-year period following the payment of all Deferred Interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism.
26
Subject to certain conditions and the exclusion described below, if the Issuer defers interest on the Debentures, the Issuer shall be required, not later than (i) the Business Day immediately following the first Interest Payment Date during an Optional Deferral Period on which it elects to pay current interest or (ii) if earlier, the Business Day following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period, to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to begin selling to persons that are not affiliates of the Issuer Qualifying Securities (the 
Alternative Payment Mechanism
). The Issuer shall be required pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, with respect to any subsequent Interest Payment Date during an Optional Deferral Period until the Deferred Interest has been paid in full, to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Securities until it has raised an amount of net proceeds that, together with the net proceeds of any sales of Qualifying Securities within the 180 days preceding such Interest Payment Date, is sufficient to pay the Deferred Interest (including interest on the deferred payments) on such Interest Payment Date, provided that, if, due to a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the Issuer is able to raise some, but not all, of the net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Securities necessary to pay all Deferred Interest (including interest on the deferred payments) on any Interest Payment Date, the Issuer shall apply any such available net proceeds on such Interest Payment Date to pay accrued and unpaid installments of interest in chronological order. The Issuer shall not pay Deferred Interest (including interest on the deferred payments) on the Debentures from any source other than the net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Securities, unless otherwise required at the time by any applicable regulatory authority. In addition, such applicable regulatory authority may prevent the Issuer from selling Qualifying Securities or may prevent the Issuer from using the proceeds of any sales of Qualifying Securities to pay any Deferred Interest.
 
Qualifying Securities
 means (i) 
Qualifying Warrants
, which are net share settled warrants to purchase the Issuers Common Stock that have an exercise price greater than the Current Stock Market Price of the Issuers Common Stock as of their date of issuance, that the Issuer is not entitled to redeem for cash and that the holders of such warrants are not entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase for cash in any circumstance and (ii)
Qualifying Preferred Stock
.
 
The 
Current Stock Market Price
 of the Issuers Common Stock on any date shall be the closing sale price per share (or if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on that date as reported in composite transactions by the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Issuers Common Stock is not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported by the principal U.S. securities exchange on which the Issuers Common Stock is traded or quoted. If the Issuers Common Stock is not either listed or quoted on any U.S. securities exchange on the relevant date, the Current Stock Market
27
 
Price shall be the last quoted bid price for the Issuers Common Stock in the over-the-counter market on the relevant date as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization. If the Issuers Common Stock is not so quoted, the Current Stock Market Price shall be the average of the mid-point of the last bid and ask prices for the Issuers Common Stock on the relevant date from each of at least three nationally recognized independent investment banking firms selected by the Issuer for this purpose.
 
The Issuer shall not be required to issue Qualifying Warrants prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism to the extent that the number of shares of the Issuers Common Stock underlying any issuance of Qualifying Warrants applied to pay such interest, together with the shares underlying all prior issuances of Qualifying Warrants during such Optional Deferral Period so applied, would exceed 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Issuers Common Stock as of the date of the Issuers then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements (the 
Warrant Issuance Cap
). In addition, the Issuer may not issue Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock if the net proceeds of any issuance of Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock applied to pay interest, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock so applied, would exceed 25% of the aggregate liquidation amount of the issuance of the Capital Securities (the 
Preferred Stock Issuance Cap
).
 
Once the Issuer reaches the Warrant Issuance Cap for any Optional Deferral Period, the Issuer shall not be required to issue more Qualifying Warrants prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Optional Deferral Period even if the number of underlying shares referred to above subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of the Issuers Common Stock. The Warrant Issuance Cap shall cease to apply following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, at which point the Issuer shall have the right to pay any Deferred Interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, using the Alternative Payment Mechanism, subject to the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, the Share Cap and any Market Disruption Event. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Warrant Issuance Cap has been reached during an Optional Deferral Period and
the Issuer subsequently pays all deferred payments (including accrued interest thereon), the Warrant Issuance Cap shall cease to apply, and shall only apply again once the Issuer starts a new Optional Deferral Period. The Preferred Stock Issuance Cap shall apply so long as the Debentures remain outstanding.
 
The Issuer shall not be required to issue Qualifying Warrants pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism to the extent that the total number of shares of the Issuers Common Stock underlying such Qualifying Warrants, together with all prior issuances of Qualifying Warrants, exceeds 40 million shares (the
28
Share Cap
). The Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to increase the Share Cap from time to time to a number of shares that would allow the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Alternative Payment Mechanism. The Share Cap shall be adjusted proportionately for any change in the number of outstanding shares of the Issuers Common Stock by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, effective upon the effective date of any such transaction.
 
If, due to a Market Disruption Event, the Warrant Issuance Cap, Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, Share Cap or otherwise, the Issuer was able to raise some, but not all, eligible proceeds necessary to pay all Deferred Interest (including compounded interest thereon) on any Interest Payment Date, the Issuer shall apply any available eligible proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid installments of interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order. If the Issuer has outstanding securities in addition to, and that rank
pari passu
with, the Debentures under which the Issuer is obligated to sell Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for payment of the Deferred Interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and such other securities on a pro rata basis in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such securities, or on such other basis as any regulator applicable to the Issuer may approve.
 
The Issuer shall not be required to sell Qualifying Securities in accordance with the Alternative Payment Mechanism during any quarterly period preceding any Interest Payment Date to the extent it provides written certification to the Trustee (which the Trustee shall promptly forward upon receipt to each holder of record of Capital Securities) no more than 30 and no less than 15 days in advance of such Interest Payment Date certifying that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (a) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which that certification is provided or (b) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period, but the Issuer
was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient eligible proceeds during the rest of such period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest.
 
If the Issuer is involved in a business combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the surviving entitys voting stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the business combination, then the Alternative Payment Mechanism shall not apply to any deferral period that is terminated on the interest payment date immediately succeeding the date of consummation of the business combination.

A 
Market Disruption Event
 means, for purposes of sales of Qualifying Securities pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism or sales of Replacement Securities pursuant to the Replacement Capital Obligation, as applicable (collectively, the 
Permitted Securities
), the occurrence or existence of any of the following events or sets of circumstances:
 
 
 
 
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
 
If an Event of Default or a Default attributable to (i) the failure of the Issuer to pay any amounts payable in respect of the Debentures on the date such amounts are otherwise payable or (ii) a breach of the Alternative Payment Mechanism or the Replacement Capital Obligation has occurred and is continuing, a registered holder of Capital Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Issuer for enforcement of payment to such registered holder of an amount equal to the amount payable in respect of Debentures having a principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount
31
(as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the Capital Securities held by such registered holder (a 
Direct Action
). The Issuer shall have the right to set off any payment made to such registered holder of Capital Securities by the Issuer in connection with a Direct Action.
 
As long as any Debentures are held by the Issuer Trust, the Issuer covenants (i) to continue to hold, directly or indirectly, 100% of the Common Securities (as defined in the Trust Agreement), provided that certain successors that are permitted pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture may succeed to the Issuers ownership of the Common Securities, (ii) as holder of the Common Securities, not to voluntarily dissolve, windup or liquidate the Issuer Trust, other than (a) in connection with a distribution of Debentures to the holders of the Capital Securities in liquidation of the Issuer Trust or (b) in connection with certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations permitted by the Trust Agreement and (iii) to use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement, to cause the Issuer Trust to continue not to be taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
If, and for so long as, (i) the Issuer Trust is the holder of all the Debentures and (ii) the Issuer Trust is required to pay any additional taxes, duties or other governmental charges as a result of a Tax Event, the Issuer shall pay as additional sums on the Debentures (
Additional Sums
) such amounts as may be required so that the Distributions (as defined in the Trust Agreement) paid by the Issuer Trust shall not be reduced as a result of any such additional taxes, duties or other governmental charges.
 
The Issuer, as borrower, agrees to pay all debts and other obligations (other than with respect to the Capital Securities issued by the Issuer Trust) and all costs and expenses of the Issuer Trust (including costs and expenses relating to the organization of the Issuer Trust, the fees and expenses of the Issuer Trustees (as defined in the Trust Agreement) for the Issuer Trust and the costs and expenses relating to the operation of the Issuer Trust) and to pay any and all taxes and all costs and expenses with respect thereto (other than United States withholding taxes) to which the Issuer Trust might become subject. The foregoing obligations of the Issuer under the Debentures owned by the Issuer Trust are for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, any Person to whom any such debts, obligations, costs, expenses and taxes are owed (a 
Creditor
) whether or not such Creditor has received notice thereof. Any such Creditor may enforce such obligations of the Issuer directly against the Issuer, and the Issuer irrevocably waives any right or remedy to require that any such Creditor take any action against the Issuer Trust or any other Person before proceeding against the Issuer. The Issuer agrees to execute any additional agreements as may be necessary or desirable to give full effect to the foregoing.
32
 
The provisions of Section 3.04 and Section 10.01 of the Junior Subordinated Indenture relating to discharge, defeasance and covenant defeasance are not applicable to this Debenture.
 
This Debenture and all other obligations of the Issuer hereunder shall constitute part of the junior subordinated debt of the Issuer, shall be issued under the Junior Subordinated Indenture and shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Junior Subordinated Indenture, to all Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Junior Subordinated Indenture) of the Issuer. For the avoidance of doubt, this Debenture will rank with the claims of the Issuer's trade creditors.
pari passu
 
This Debenture, and any Debenture or Debentures issued upon transfer or exchange hereof, is issuable only in fully registered form, without coupons, and is issuable only in denominations of US$25 and any integral multiple of US$25 in excess thereof, unless otherwise indicated on the face thereof.
 
The Bank of New York has been appointed registrar for the Debentures (the 
Registrar
, which term includes any successor registrar appointed by the Issuer), and the Registrar shall maintain at its office in The City of New York a register for the registration and transfer of Debentures. This Debenture may be transferred at the aforesaid office of the Registrar by surrendering this Debenture for cancellation, accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar and duly executed by the registered holder hereof in person or by the holders attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon the Registrar shall issue in the name of the transferee or transferees, in exchange herefor, a new Debenture or Debentures having identical terms and provisions and having a like aggregate principal amount in authorized denominations, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein;
provided, however,
that the Registrar shall not be required (i) to register the transfer of or exchange any Debenture that has been called for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of Debentures being redeemed in part or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange Debentures to the extent and during the period so provided in the Junior Subordinated Indenture with respect to the redemption of Debentures. Debentures are exchangeable at said office for other Debentures of other authorized denominations of equal aggregate principal amount having identical terms and provisions. All such exchanges and transfers of Debentures shall be free of charge, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in connection therewith. All Debentures surrendered for exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar and executed by the registered holder in person or by the holders attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of registration of any Debenture delivered upon any exchange or transfer of Debentures shall be such that no gain or loss of interest results from such exchange or transfer.
 
33
 
In case this Debenture shall at any time become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen and this Debenture or evidence of the loss, theft or destruction thereof (together with the indemnity hereinafter referred to and such other documents or proof as may be required in the premises) shall be delivered to the Registrar, a new Debenture of like tenor shall be issued by the Issuer in exchange for this Debenture, but, if this Debenture has been destroyed, lost or stolen, only upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Registrar and the Issuer that such Debenture was destroyed or lost or stolen and, if required, upon receipt also of indemnity satisfactory to each of them. All expenses and reasonable charges associated with procuring such indemnity and with the preparation, authentication and delivery of a new Debenture shall be borne by the owner of the Debenture mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen.
 
The Junior Subordinated Indenture permits the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of all series issued under the Junior Subordinated Indenture then outstanding and affected (voting as one class), to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner the rights of the holders of each series so affected;
provided
that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security affected thereby and the prior written consent of each registered holder of Capital Securities, to the extent that the Debentures are held by any Morgan Stanley Capital Trust (including Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII), (i) extend the final maturity of any such debt security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, except as otherwise provided herein or in the Junior Subordinated Indenture, or reduce any amount payable on redemption or repayment thereof, or change the currency of payment thereof, or impair or affect the rights of any holder to institute suit for the payment thereof without the consent of the holder of each debt security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of debt securities the consent of the holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture; provided, however, that neither this Debenture nor the Junior Subordinated Indenture may be amended to alter the subordination provisions hereof or thereof without the written consent of each holder of Senior Indebtedness then outstanding that would be adversely affected thereby. In addition, so long as any of the Capital Securities remain outstanding, no such modification may be made that adversely affects the holders of such Capital Securities in any material respect, and no termination of the Junior Subordinated Indenture may occur, and no waiver of any Event of Default or Default may be effective, without the prior consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the outstanding Capital Securities unless and until the principal of (and premium, if any, on) the Debentures and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon have been paid in full and certain other conditions are satisfied. So long as the Issuer acts in accordance with the terms of the Debentures, the Issuer may defer interest payable on the Debentures in 
34
accordance with the terms hereof without the consent of the Issuer Trust or the holders of Capital Securities. However, the Issuer may not amend this Debenture or the Junior Subordinated Indenture to remove the rights of registered holders of Capital Securities to institute a Direct Action without the prior written consent of all the registered holders of Capital Securities of the Trust.
 
So long as this Debenture shall be outstanding, the Issuer shall cause to be maintained an office or agency for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Debenture as herein provided in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and an office or agency in said Borough of Manhattan for the registration, transfer and exchange as aforesaid of the Debentures. Under Section 3.02 of the Junior Subordinated Indenture, the Issuer has initially appointed the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as its agency for the foregoing purposes. The Issuer may subsequently designate other agencies for the payment of said principal, premium and interest at such place or places (subject to applicable laws and regulations) as the Issuer may decide. So long as there shall be such an agency, the Issuer shall keep the Trustee advised of the names and locations of such agencies, if any are so designated other than that of the Trustee.
 
With respect to moneys paid by the Issuer and held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent for payment of the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on any Debentures that remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, interest or premium shall have become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or otherwise), (i) the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall notify the holders of such Debentures that such moneys shall be repaid to the Issuer and any Person claiming such moneys shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment thereof and (ii) such moneys shall be so repaid to the Issuer. Upon such repayment all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease, without, however, limiting in any way any obligation that the Issuer may have to pay the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on this Debenture as the same shall become due.
 
No
provision of this Debenture or of the Junior Subordinated Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this
Debenture at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the registered holder of this Debenture.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Debenture for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the holder in whose name this Debenture is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Debenture be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
35
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or the interest on this Debenture, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Junior Subordinated Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
This Debenture shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

17
Distributions payable for any period less than a full Distribution Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual number of days elapsed in a partial month in a period. Distributions on the Trust Securities will accumulate from and including the most recent Distribution Date to which Distributions have been paid or duly provided for, or, if no Distributions have been paid or duly provided for, from and including April 26, 2007 to but excluding the date the Liquidation Amount has been paid or duly made available for payment.

So long as no Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Depositor has the right under the Indenture to defer the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures at any time and from time to time for a period not exceeding 40 consecutive quarterly periods (an Optional Deferral Period), provided that no Optional Deferral Period may extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the acceleration of the Junior Subordinated Debentures following a Debenture Event of Default. As a consequence of any such deferral, quarterly Distributions on the Trust Securities by the Issuer Trust will also be deferred to the extent and except as provided in the Junior Subordinated Debentures, and the amount of Distributions to which Holders of the Trust Securities are entitled that have been so deferred will accumulate additional Distributions thereon at the rate per annum of 6.45%, compounded quarterly from and including the most recent Distribution payment date on which Distributions were paid, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual number of days elapsed in a partial month in such period. Additional Distributions payable for each full Distribution Period will be computed by dividing the rate per annum by four (4). The term Distributions as used in Section 4.1 shall include any such additional Distributions provided pursuant to this Section 4.1(a)(iii).
 
(iv)
 
In the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings in respect of the Depositor, as described in Section 5.01(b) or (c) of the Indenture, prior to the redemption or repayment of the Junior Subordinated Debentures, Holders of the Junior Subordinated Debentures shall only have a claim for, or right to receive, distributions with respect to deferred interest, including accrued interest on the deferred payments, to the extent such interest (including accrued interest on the deferred payments) relates to the first two years of the Optional Deferral Period and, consequently, Holders of the Trust Securities shall only have a claim for, or right to receive, Distributions as so reduced.
 
(v)
 
Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions.

Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities at

(vi)
 
the place or places where Trust Securities are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price.
 
The Issuer Trust in issuing the Trust Securities shall use CUSIP numbers, and the Property Trustee shall indicate the CUSIP numbers of the Trust Securities in notices of redemption and related materials as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Trust Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and related material.
 
(c)
 
The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the applicable proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Junior Subordinated Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer
 
19
 Trust has funds then on hand and legally available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price.
 
(d)
 
If the Issuer Trust gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Capital Securities held in book-entry form, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not held in book-entry form, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holder of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then, upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Securities will cease to be Outstanding. In the event that any date on which any applicable Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the applicable Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from and including the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to but excluding the date such applicable Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price.
 
(e)
 
Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of such Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated pro rata to the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based on the relative aggregate Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro rata basis based on their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, or if the Capital Securities are then held in the form of a Global Capital Security in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Capital Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Capital Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes
 
20
of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities that has been or is to be redeemed.
 
SECTION 4.3. Subordination of Common Securities.
 
 
(a)
 
Payment of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, the Redemption Price of, and the Liquidation Distribution in respect of, the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall be made, subject to Section 4.2(e), pro rata among the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based on the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date or Redemption Date any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(a) or a Debenture Default specified in Section 5.06(a) or 5.06(b) of the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including any Additional Amounts) on, Redemption Price of, or Liquidation Distribution in respect of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on all Outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution Periods terminating on or prior thereto, or, in the case of payment of the Redemption Price, the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, or in the case of payment of the Liquidation Distribution the full amount of such Liquidation Distribution on all Outstanding Capital Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, the Redemption Price of, or the Liquidation Distribution in respect of Capital Securities then due and payable. The existence of an Event of Default does not entitle the Holders of Trust Securities to accelerate the maturity thereof.
 
(b)
 
In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(a) of the Indenture or any Debenture Default specified in Section 5.06(a) or 5.06(b) of the Indenture, the Holder of the Common Securities shall have no right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effects of all such Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all such Events of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Capital Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities and not on behalf of the Holder of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf.
 
SECTION 4.4. Payment Procedures.
 
 
Payments of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) in respect of the Capital Securities shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Capital Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency in immediately available funds, which will credit the relevant accounts on the applicable Distribution Dates. Payments of
 
21
Distributions, other than Distributions payable at maturity, to Holders of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon written request of such Holder to the Securities Registrar not later than 15 calendar days prior to the date on which the Distribution is payable. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed between the Property Trustee and the Holder of the Common Securities.
 
SECTION 4.5. Tax Returns and Reports.
 
The Administrators shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Depositors expense, and file all United States Federal, state and local tax and information returns and reports required to be filed by or in respect of the Issuer Trust. In this regard, the Administrators shall (a) prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Internal Revenue Service forms required to be filed in respect of the Issuer Trust in each taxable year of the Issuer Trust and (b) prepare and furnish (or cause to be prepared and furnished) to each Holder all Internal Revenue Service forms required to be provided by the Issuer Trust. The Administrators shall provide the Depositor and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns and reports promptly after such filing or furnishing. The Issuer Trustees shall comply with United States Federal withholding and backup withholding tax laws and information reporting requirements with respect to any payments to Holders under the Trust Securities.
 
On or before December 15 of each year during which any Capital Securities are Outstanding, the Administrators shall furnish to the Property Trustee such information as may be reasonably requested by the Property Trustee in order that the Property Trustee may prepare the information which it is required to report for such year on Internal Revenue Service Forms 1096 and 1099 pursuant to Section 6049 of the Code. Such information shall include the amount of original issue discount includible in income for each Outstanding Capital Security during such year.
 
SECTION 4.6. Payment of Taxes, Duties, Etc. of the Issuer Trust.
 
 
Upon receipt under the Junior Subordinated Debentures of Additional Sums, the Property Trustee shall promptly pay, or cause the Administrators to pay in connection with the filing of any tax returns or reports pursuant to Section 4.5, any taxes, duties or governmental charges of whatsoever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed on the Issuer Trust by the United States or any other taxing authority.
 
SECTION 4.7. Payments under Indenture or Pursuant to Direct Actions.
 
 
Any amount payable hereunder to any Holder of Capital Securities shall be reduced by the amount of any corresponding payment such Holder has directly received pursuant to Section 5.01 of the Indenture or Section 5.13 of this Trust Agreement.
 
22
SECTION 4.8. Liability of the Holder of Common Securities.
 
 
The Holder of Common Securities shall be liable for the debts and obligations of the Issuer Trust (other than with respect to the Trust Securities) to the extent not satisfied out of the Issuer Trusts assets.
 
 
 
SECTION 5.1. Initial Ownership.
 
 
Upon the creation of the Issuer Trust and the contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.3 and until the issuance of the Trust Securities, and at any time during which no Trust Securities are Outstanding, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficial owner of the Issuer Trust.
 
SECTION 5.2. The Trust Securities Certificates.
 
 
(a)
 
The Trust Securities Certificates shall be issued in multiples of $25 and shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer Trust by manual or facsimile signature of at least one Administrator. Trust Securities Certificates bearing the manual signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Issuer Trust, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates. A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Holder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Holder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferees name pursuant to Section 5.5.
 
(b)
 
Upon their original issuance, Capital Securities Certificates shall be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Capital Securities Certificates which will be deposited with or on behalf of the Depositary and registered in the name of the Depositarys nominee. Unless and until it is exchangeable in whole or in part for the Capital Securities in definitive form, a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of such Depositary or a nominee of such successor.
 
(c)
 
Common Securities Certificates representing the Common Securities shall be issued to the Depositor in the form of one or more definitive Common Securities Certificates.
 
SECTION 5.3. Execution and Delivery of Trust Securities Certificates.
 
 
At the Closing Date, at least one of the Administrators shall cause Trust Securities Certificates, in an aggregate Liquidation Amount as provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, to be executed on behalf of the Issuer Trust by manual or facsimile signature. The Capital Securities so
 
23
executed shall be delivered to the Property Trustee and upon such delivery the Property Trustee shall manually authenticate upon the written order of the Depositor such Capital Securities Certificates and deliver such Capital Securities Certificates upon the written order of the Depositor, executed by an authorized officer thereof, without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized denominations.
 
SECTION 5.4. Global Capital Security.
 
 
(a)
 
Any Global Capital Security issued under this Trust Agreement shall be registered in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency and delivered to such custodian therefor, and such Global Capital Security shall constitute a single Capital Security for all purposes of this Trust Agreement.
 
(b)
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, a Global Capital Security may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Capital Securities registered, and no transfer of the Global Capital Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Clearing Agency for such Global Capital Security, or its nominee thereof unless (i) such Clearing Agency advises the Property Trustee in writing that such Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities as Clearing Agency with respect to such Global Capital Security or if it ceases to be a Clearing Agency under the Exchange Act, and the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor within 90 days after receiving such notice or becoming aware that the Depositary is no longer so registered, or (ii) the Issuer Trust at its option advises the Depositary in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency.
 
(c)
 
If a Capital Security is to be exchanged in whole or in part for a beneficial interest in a Global Capital Security, then either (i) such Global Capital Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or cancellation as provided in this Article V or (ii) the aggregate Liquidation Amount thereof shall be reduced or increased by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged or cancelled or equal to the Liquidation Amount of such other Capital Security to be so exchanged for a beneficial interest therein, as the case may be, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Security Registrar, whereupon the Property Trustee, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, shall instruct the Clearing Agency or its authorized representative to make a corresponding adjustment to its records. Upon any such surrender or adjustment of a Global Capital Security by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Property Trustee shall, subject to Section 5.4(b) and as otherwise provided in this Article V, authenticate and deliver any Capital Securities issuable in exchange for such Global Capital Security (or any portion thereof) in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. The Property Trustee shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such instructions.
 
(d)
 
Every Capital Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Capital Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Article V or Article IV or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Capital Security, unless such Global Capital Security is registered
 
24
in the name of a Person other than the Clearing Agency for such Global Capital Security or a nominee thereof.
 
(e)
 
The Clearing Agency or its nominee, as the registered owner of a Global Capital Security, shall be considered the Holder of the Capital Securities represented by such Global Capital Security for all purposes under this Trust Agreement and the Capital Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Capital Security shall hold such interests pursuant to the Applicable Procedures and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of any such Capital Securities in definitive form and shall not be considered the Holders thereof under this Trust Agreement. Accordingly, any such owners beneficial interest in the Global Capital Security shall be shown only on, and the transfer of such interest shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Clearing Agency or its nominee. Neither the Property Trustee nor the Securities Registrar shall have any liability in respect of any transfers effected by the Clearing Agency.
 
(f)
 
The rights of owners of beneficial interests in a Global Capital Security shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such owners and the Clearing Agency.
 
SECTION 5.5. Registration of Transfer and Exchange Generally; Certain Transfers and Exchanges; Capital Securities Certificates.
 
 
(a)
 
The Property Trustee shall keep or cause to be kept at its Corporate Trust Office a register or registers for the purpose of registering Capital Securities Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates in which the registrar and transfer agent with respect to the Capital Securities (the Securities Registrar), subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, shall provide for the registration of Capital Securities Certificates and Common Securities Certificates (subject to Section 5.11 in the case of Common Securities Certificates) and registration of transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates as herein provided. Such register is herein sometimes referred to as the Securities Register. The Property Trustee is hereby appointed Securities Registrar for the purpose of registering Capital Securities and transfers of Capital Securities as herein provided.
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Capital Security at the offices or agencies of the Property Trustee designated for that purpose an Administrator shall execute, and the Property Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Capital Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations of like tenor and aggregate Liquidation Amount and bearing such legends as may be required by this Trust Agreement.
 
At the option of the Holder, Capital Securities may be exchanged for other Capital Securities of any authorized denominations, of like tenor and aggregate Liquidation Amount and bearing such legends as may be required by this Trust Agreement, upon surrender of the Capital Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any securities are so surrendered for exchange, an Administrator shall execute and the Property Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Capital Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
25
All Capital Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Capital Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Issuer Trust, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Trust Agreement, as the Capital Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
 
Every Capital Security presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Property Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Property Trustee and the Securities Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holders attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any transfer or exchange of Capital Securities, but the Property Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Capital Securities.
 
Neither the Issuer Trust nor the Property Trustee shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Capital Security during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the first mailing of the notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Capital Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any such Capital Security to be redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
 
(b)
 
Certain Transfers and Exchanges. Trust Securities may only be transferred, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Trust Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any transfer or purported transfer of any Trust Security not made in accordance with this Trust Agreement shall be null and void.
 
(i)
 
Non-Global Security to Non-Global Security. A Capital Security that is not a Global Capital Security may be transferred, in whole or in part, to a Person who takes delivery in the form of another Trust Security that is not a Global Security as provided in Section 5.5(a).
 
(ii)
 
Free Transferability. Subject to this Section 5.5, Capital Securities shall be freely transferable.
 
(iii)
 
Exchanges Between Global Capital Security and Non-Global Capital Security. A beneficial interest in a Global Capital Security may be exchanged for a Capital Security that is not a Global Capital Security as provided in Section 5.4.
 
SECTION 5.6. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Securities Certificates.
 
 
If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall be surrendered to the Securities Registrar, or if the Securities Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Securities Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Securities Registrar and the Administrators such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Administrators, or any one of
 
26
them, on behalf of the Issuer Trust shall execute and make available for delivery, and the Property Trustee shall authenticate, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrators or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust corresponding to that evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Certificate, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time.
 
SECTION 5.7. Persons Deemed Holders.
 
 
The Issuer Trustees or the Securities Registrar shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities are issued as the owner of such Trust Securities for the purpose of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Issuer Trustees, the Administrators nor the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 5.8. Access to List of Holders Names and Addresses.
 
 
Each Holder and each Owner shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Depositor, the Property Trustee, or the Administrators accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.
 
SECTION 5.9. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
 
 
The Property Trustee shall designate, with the consent of the Administrators, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Capital Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer Trustees in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Property Trustee initially designates its Corporate Trust Office at 101 Barclay Street, Floor 8 West, New York, NY 10286, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, as its corporate trust office for such purposes. The Property Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor, the Administrators and to the Holders of any change in the location of the Securities Register or any such office or agency.
 
SECTION 5.10. Appointment of Paying Agent.
 
 
The Paying Agent shall make Distributions to Holders from the Payment Account and shall report the amounts of such Distributions to the Property Trustee and the Administrators. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account solely for the purpose of making the Distributions referred to above. The Property Trustee may revoke such power and remove any Paying Agent in its sole discretion. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Property Trustee. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days written notice to the Administrators and the Property Trustee. In the event that the Property Trustee shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying
 
27
Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Property Trustee shall appoint a successor (which shall be a bank or trust company) that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrators to act as Paying Agent. Such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Property Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Issuer Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Holders in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.6 herein shall apply to the Bank also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the Bank shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Trust Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent chosen by the Property Trustee unless the context requires otherwise.
 
SECTION 5.11. Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor.
 
 
At the Closing Date, the Depositor shall acquire and retain beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities. Neither the Depositor nor any successor Holder of the Common Securities may transfer less than all the Common Securities, and the Depositor or any such successor Holder may transfer the Common Securities only (i) in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Depositor into another Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Depositor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, or (ii) to an Affiliate of the Depositor in compliance with applicable law (including the Securities Act and applicable state securities and blue sky laws). To the fullest extent permitted by law, any attempted transfer of the Common Securities, other than as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, shall be void. The Administrators shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT TO THE DEPOSITOR OR AN AFFILIATE OF THE DEPOSITOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND SECTION 5.11 OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT.
 
SECTION 5.12. Notices to Clearing Agency.
 
 
To the extent that a notice or other communication to the Holders is required under this Trust Agreement, for so long as Capital Securities are represented by a Global Capital Securities Certificate, the Administrators and the Issuer Trustees shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligations to the Owners.
 
SECTION 5.13. Rights of Holders.
 
 
(a)
 
The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or
 
28
division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor, as provided herein, will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Issuer Trust. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.8, the Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
(b)
 
For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debt Securities Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Junior Subordinated Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have such right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debt Securities Trustee.
 
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debt Securities Trustee as provided in the Indenture, the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debt Securities Trustee, may waive all defaults and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
 
(i)
 
the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debt Securities Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
 
(A)
 
all overdue installments of interest on all of the Junior Subordinated Debentures,
 
(B)
 
any accrued Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) on all of the Junior Subordinated Debentures,
 
(C)
 
the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Junior Subordinated Debentures which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Junior Subordinated Debentures, and
 
(D)
 
all sums paid or advanced by the Debt Securities Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debt Securities Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and
 
(ii)
 
all Debenture Defaults with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Junior Subordinated Debentures which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.10 of the Indenture.
 
29
If the Property Trustee fails to annul any such declaration and waive such default, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities shall also have the right to rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences by written notice to the Depositor, the Property Trustee and the Debt Securities Trustee, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Clause (i) and (ii) of this Section 5.13(b).
 
The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past Debenture Default, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debt Securities Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Capital Securities all or part of which is represented by Global Capital Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.13(b).
 
(c)
 
For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(a) or a Debenture Default specified in Section 5.06(a) or 5.06(b) of the Indenture or a failure to comply with the Alternative Payment Mechanism or the Replacement Capital Obligation (each as defined in the Junior Subordinated Debentures), any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 5.01 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal amount of or interest on Junior Subordinated Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a Direct Action). Except as set forth in Sections 5.13(b) and 5.13(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Junior Subordinated Debentures.
 
30
 
SECTION 6.1. Limitations on Holders Voting Rights.
 
 
(a)
 
Except as provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as members of an association.
 
(b)
 
So long as any Junior Subordinated Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the Property Trustee shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debt Securities Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Property Trustee with respect to such Junior Subordinated Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 5.10 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Junior Subordinated Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each Holder of Junior Subordinated Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Property Trustee shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action will not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation, a partnership or any other arrangement other than as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
 
(c)
 
If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trust otherwise proposes to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the interests, powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities.
 
31
SECTION 6.2. Notice of Meetings.
 
 
Notice of all meetings of the Holders, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Holder of record, at his registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.
 
SECTION 6.3. Meetings of Holders.
 
 
No annual meeting of Holders is required to be held. The Property Trustee, however, shall call a meeting of Holders to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Holders of record of 25% of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities and the Administrators or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of Holders of Capital Securities to vote on any matters as to which Holders are entitled to vote.
 
Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Holders of the Capital Securities.
 
If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding Capital Securities representing at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities held by the Holders present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of Capital Securities, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
 
SECTION 6.4. Voting Rights.
 
 
Holders shall be entitled to one vote for each $25 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Outstanding Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Holders are entitled to vote.
 
SECTION 6.5. Proxies, etc.
 
 
At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Issuer Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity
 
32
shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
 
SECTION 6.6. Holder Action by Written Consent.
 
 
Any action which may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all Trust Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing.
 
SECTION 6.7. Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
 
 
For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrators or Property Trustee may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
 
SECTION 6.8. Acts of Holders.
 
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the Act of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
 
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which any Issuer Trustee or Administrator receiving the same deems sufficient.
 
The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
 
33
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, the Administrators or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
 
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.
 
If any dispute shall arise among the Holders, the Administrators or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.
 
SECTION 6.9. Inspection of Records.
 
 
Upon reasonable notice to the Administrators and the Property Trustee, the records of the Issuer Trust shall be open to inspection by Holders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Holders interest as a Holder.

(f)

The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that:
 
(a)
 
the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Closing Date on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement, and the Holders will be, as of each such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and
 
(b)
 
there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Issuer Trust (or the Issuer Trustees on behalf of the Issuer Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by either the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, of this Trust Agreement.
 
 
SECTION 8.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
 
 
(a)
 
The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees and the Administrators shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Issuer Trustees or the Administrators to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur
 
35
any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees or the Administrators shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrator from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Issuer Trustee or Administrator has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Issuer Trustee or Administrator shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Issuer Trustees or Administrators good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees and Administrators otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees and Administrators.
 
(b)
 
All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that neither the Issuer Trustees nor the Administrators are personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
 
(c)
 
The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Article V of the Indenture), the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders and shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
 
(d)
 
No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(i)
 
prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
 
(A)
 
the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Agreement (including
 
36
pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and
 
(B)
 
in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Trust Agreement;
 
(ii)
 
the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
 
(iii)
 
the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement;
 
(iv)
 
the Property Trustees sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Junior Subordinated Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(v)
 
the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
 
(vi)
 
the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrators or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, the Administrators or the Depositor; and
 
(vii)
 
no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such
 
37
funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(e)
 
The Administrators shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrator be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Administrator, the Issuer Trustees or the Depositor.
 
SECTION 8.2. Certain Notices.
 
 
Within ten Business Days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders and the Administrators, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
 
Within ten Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositors exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders and the Administrators, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
 
SECTION 8.3. Certain Rights of Property Trustee.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1:
 
(a)
 
the Property Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
 
(b)
 
any direction or act of the Depositor contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers Certificate;
 
(c)
 
the Property Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any re-recording, refiling or registration thereof;
 
(d)
 
the Property Trustee may consult with counsel of its own choosing (which counsel may be counsel to the Depositor or any of its Affiliates, and may include any of its employees) and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction;
 
38
(e)
 
the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Property Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; provided, that nothing contained in this Section 8.3(e) shall be taken to relieve the Property Trustee, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement;
 
(f)
 
the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit;
 
(g)
 
the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any of its duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
 
(h)
 
whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Property Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders (which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action), (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received, and (iii) shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with such instructions;
 
(i)
 
except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement. No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on any Issuer Trustee or Administrator to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Property Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to any Issuer Trustee or Administrator shall be construed to be a duty;
 
(j)
 
if (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action or (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein or (iii) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Holders are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting written instructions of the Depositor as
 
39
to the course of action to be taken and the Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing to take, or to refrain from taking, by the Depositor; provided, however, that if the Property Trustee does not receive such instructions of the Depositor within ten Business Days after it has delivered such notice, or such reasonably shorter period of time set forth in such notice (which to the extent practicable shall not be less than two Business Days), it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action not inconsistent with this Trust Agreement as it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Holders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct;
 
(k)
 
whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be established before undertaking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Property Trustee (unless other evidence is herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, request and conclusively rely upon an Officers Certificate which, upon receipt of such request, shall be promptly delivered by the Depositor or the Administrator;
 
(l)
 
when the Property Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with a Bankruptcy Event, such expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law or law relating to creditors rights generally; and
 
(m)
 
the Property Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of an Event of Default unless such Event of Default has occurred as a result of the act or failure to act of the Property Trustee, a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Property Trustee receives written notice of such event from Holders of at least 25% of the Outstanding Trust Securities (based upon Liquidation Amount).
 
SECTION 8.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
 
 
The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer Trust, and the Issuer Trustees and the Administrators do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Issuer Trustees and the Administrators shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Junior Subordinated Debentures.
 
SECTION 8.5. May Hold Securities.
 
 
The Administrators, any Issuer Trustee or any other agent of any Issuer Trustee or the Issuer Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, and except as provided in the definition of the term Outstanding in Article I, may otherwise deal with the Issuer Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not an Administrator, Issuer Trustee or such other agent.
 
SECTION 8.6. Compensation; Indemnity; Fees.
 
 
The Depositor, as borrower, agrees:
 
40
(a)
 
to pay to the Issuer Trustees from time to time such reasonable compensation for all services rendered by them hereunder as the parties shall agree from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
 
(b)
 
to reimburse the Issuer Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Issuer Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to their negligence or willful misconduct; and
 
(c)
 
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Issuer Trustee, (ii) each Administrator, (iii) any Affiliate of any Issuer Trustee, (iv) any officer, director, shareholder, employee, representative or agent of any Issuer Trustee, and (v) any employee or agent of the Issuer Trust (referred to herein as an Indemnified Person) from and against any loss, damage, liability, tax, penalty, expense or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by such Indemnified Person arising out of or in connection with the creation, operation or dissolution of the Issuer Trust or any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Issuer Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Trust Agreement, except that no Indemnified Person (other than an Administrator) shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions, and further provided that no Administrator shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Administrator by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions.
 
The provisions of this Section 8.6 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement or the earlier resignation or removal of any Issuer Trustee.
 
No Issuer Trustee may claim any lien or charge on any Trust Property as a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.6.
 
The Depositor, any Administrator and any Issuer Trustee (subject to Section 8.8) may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Issuer Trust, and the Issuer Trust and the Holders of Trust Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Trust Agreement in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Issuer Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. Neither the Depositor, any Administrator, nor any Issuer Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Issuer Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Issuer Trust, could be taken by the Issuer Trust, and the Depositor, any Administrator or any Issuer Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Issuer Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Depositor or any Affiliate of the
 
41
Depositor, or may act as depository for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Depositor or its Affiliates.
 
In the event that the Property Trustee is also acting as Paying Agent or Securities Registrar hereunder, the rights and protections afforded to the Property Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII shall also be afforded to such Paying Agent or Securities Registrar.

The Property Trustee shall be a Person that is a national- or state-chartered bank and eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
 
(b)
 
There shall at all times be one or more Administrators hereunder. Each Administrator shall be either a natural person who is at least 21 years of age or a legal entity that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind that entity. An employee, officer or Affiliate of the Depositor may serve as an Administrator.

The Delaware Trustee shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the State of Delaware or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware and that otherwise meets the requirements of applicable Delaware law that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity.
 
SECTION 8.8. Conflicting Interests.
 
 
(a)
 
If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement.
 
(b)
 
The Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture shall be deemed to be sufficiently described in this Trust Agreement for the purposes of clause (i) of the first proviso contained in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any
 
42
jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Property Trustee shall have power to appoint, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Administrators shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the United States or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the United States that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity.
 
Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor.
 
Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely:
 
(a)
 
The Trust Securities shall be executed by one or more Administrators, and the Capital Securities shall be authenticated by the manual signature of the Property Trustee and delivered and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Property Trustees specified hereunder, shall be exercised, solely by the Property Trustee and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
 
(b)
 
The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
 
(c)
 
The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, in case a Debenture Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section.
 
43
(d)
 
No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder.
 
(e)
 
The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee or any employees or agents of a co-trustee and separate trustee nor shall it be liable for the supervision of a co-trustee or separate trustee or employees or agents of a co-trustee and separate trustee.
 
(f)
 
Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.
 
SECTION 8.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
 
 
No resignation or removal of any Issuer Trustee (the Relevant Trustee) and no appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Issuer Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11.
 
Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, a Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders. The Relevant Trustee shall appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the Relevant Trustee on a form provided by the Administrators, and selecting the Person who agrees to the lowest expenses and charges. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Issuer Trust, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
 
Unless a Debenture Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be removed at any time by an Act of the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities. The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause, or (ii) if a Debenture Default shall have occurred and be continuing at any time. If the instrument of such removal shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after such Act, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Issuer Trust, any court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
 
If any Issuer Trustee shall resign, it shall appoint its successor. If a resigning Issuer Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if an Issuer Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if any vacancy shall occur in the office of any Issuer Trustee for any cause, the Holders of the Capital Securities, by Act of the Holders of record of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding delivered to such Relevant Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and such successor Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holders of the
 
44
Capital Securities and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Holder, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, or any other Issuer Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
 
The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Depositor and to the Administrators. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event any Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holders of the Common Securities, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by the Property Trustee following the procedures regarding expenses and charges set forth above (with the successor in each case being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirements for Administrators or Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, set forth in Section 8.7).
 
SECTION 8.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
 
 
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, the retiring Relevant Trustee and each such successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute, acknowledge and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust, and (b) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Issuer Trust by more than one Relevant Trustee and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but, on request of the Issuer Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust.
 
Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Issuer Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
 
No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
 
45
SECTION 8.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
 
 
Any Person into which an Issuer Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Issuer Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Issuer Trustee, shall be the successor of such Issuer Trustee hereunder, provided that such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.
 
SECTION 8.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Issuer Trust.
 
 
If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor (or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor (or any such other obligor) as is required by the Trust Indenture Act.
 
SECTION 8.14. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
 
In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other similar judicial proceeding relative to the Issuer Trust or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities or the property of the Issuer Trust or of such other obligor, the Property Trustee (irrespective of whether any Distributions on the Trust Securities shall then be due and payable and irrespective of whether the Property Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer Trust for the payment of any past due Distributions) shall be entitled and empowered, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)
 
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any Distributions owing and unpaid in respect of the Trust Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Property Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
(b)
 
to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Property Trustee and, in the event the Property Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Property Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Property Trustee.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Property Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or compensation affecting the Trust Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or
 
46
to authorize the Property Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
SECTION 8.15. Reports by Property Trustee.
 
 
(a)
 
Not later than May 15 of each year commencing with May 15, 2007, the Property Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Trust Securities such reports as are required by Section 313 of the Trust Indenture Act, if any, in the form, in the manner and at the times provided by Section 313 of the Trust Indenture Act. The Property Trustee shall also comply with the requirements of Section 313(d) of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
(b)
 
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Property Trustee with the Depositor.
 
SECTION 8.16. Reports to the Property Trustee.
 
 
Each of the Depositor and the Administrators on behalf of the Issuer Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee, the Commission and the Holders of the Trust Securities, as applicable, such documents, reports and information as required by Section 314(a)(1) - (3) (if any) of the Trust Indenture Act and the compliance certificates required by Section 314(a)(4) and (c) of the Trust Indenture Act (provided that any certificate to be provided pursuant to Section 314(a)(4) of the Trust Indenture Act shall be provided within 120 days of the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer Trust).
 
SECTION 8.17. Evidence of Compliance with Conditions Precedent.
 
 
Each of the Depositor and the Administrators on behalf of the Issuer Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Trust Agreement which relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314(c) of the Trust Indenture Act. Any certificate or opinion required to be given pursuant to Section 314(c) shall comply with Section 314(e) of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
SECTION 8.18. Number of Issuer Trustees.

(c)
 
The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, dissolution, termination, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of an Issuer Trustee shall not operate to dissolve, terminate or annul the Issuer Trust or terminate this Trust Agreement.
 
47
SECTION 8.19. Delegation of Power.
 
 
(a)
 
Any Administrator may, by power of attorney consistent with applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section 2.7(a) or making any governmental filing; and
 
(b)
 
The Administrators shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Issuer Trust or the names of the Administrators or otherwise as the Administrators may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of this Trust Agreement.
 
SECTION 8.20. Appointment of Administrators.
 
 
(a)
 
The number of Administrators shall be such number as shall be fixed from time to time by the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities. The Administrators shall be appointed by the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities and may be removed by the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities or may resign at any time. Upon any resignation or removal, the Depositor shall appoint a successor Administrator. Each Administrator shall execute this Trust Agreement thereby agreeing to comply with, and be legally bound by, all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Trust Agreement. If at any time there is no Administrator, the Property Trustee or any Holder who has been a Holder of Trust Securities for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of one or more Administrators.
 
(b)
 
Whenever a vacancy in the number of Administrators shall occur, until such vacancy is filled by the appointment of an Administrator in accordance with this Section 8.20, the Administrators in office, regardless of their number (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement), shall have all the powers granted to the Administrators and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Administrators by this Trust Agreement.
 
(c)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event any Administrator or a Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities, incompetent, or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by the remaining Administrators, if there were at least two of them prior to such vacancy, and by the Depositor, if there were not two such Administrators immediately prior to such vacancy (with the successor in each case being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for Administrators or Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, set forth in Section 8.7).
 
48
 
SECTION 9.1. Dissolution Upon Expiration Date.
 
 
Unless earlier dissolved, the Issuer Trust shall automatically dissolve on April 15, 2067 (the Expiration Date), and thereafter the Trust Property shall be distributed in accordance with Section 9.4.
 
SECTION 9.2. Early Termination.
 
 
The first to occur of any of the following events is an Early Termination Event and the occurrence of which shall cause the dissolution of the Issuer Trust:
 
(a)
 
the occurrence of the appointment of a receiver or other similar official in any liquidation, insolvency or similar proceeding with respect to the Depositor or all or substantially all of its property, or a court or other governmental agency shall enter a decree or order and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and undischarged for a period of 60 days, unless the Depositor shall transfer the Common Securities as provided by Section 5.11, in which case this provision shall refer instead to any such successor Holder of the Common Securities;
 
(b)
 
the written direction to the Property Trustee from the Holder of the Common Securities at any time to dissolve the Issuer Trust and to distribute a Like Amount of the Junior Subordinated Debentures to Holders in exchange for the Capital Securities (which direction, subject to Section 9.4(a) and to obtaining any required regulatory approval, is optional and wholly within the discretion of the Holders of the Common Securities);
 
(c)
 
the redemption of all of the Capital Securities in connection with the redemption of all the Junior Subordinated Debentures or the maturity of the Junior Subordinated Debentures; and
 
(d)
 
the entry of an order for dissolution of the Issuer Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 9.3. Termination.
 
 
As soon as is practicable after the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 9.1 or 9.2, and upon the completion of the winding up and liquidation of the Issuer Trust, the Administrators or the Issuer Trustees (each of whom is hereby authorized to take such action) shall file a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware terminating the Trust and, upon such filing, the respective obligations and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees, the Administrators and the Issuer Trust shall terminate.
 
SECTION 9.4. Liquidation.
 
 
(a)
 
If an Early Termination Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Issuer Trust shall be wound up and liquidated by the
 
49
Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Issuer Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, to each Holder a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than 15 nor more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holders address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall:
 
(i)
 
state the Liquidation Date;
 
(ii)
 
state that, from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures; and
 
(iii)
 
provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Junior Subordinated Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Administrators or the Property Trustee shall deem appropriate.
 
(b)
 
Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Issuer Trust and distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debentures to Holders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Junior Subordinated Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates.
 
(c)
 
Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Capital Securities and Common Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) the Clearing Agency for the Capital Securities or its nominee, as the registered holder of the Global Capital Securities Certificate, shall receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Junior Subordinated Debentures to be delivered upon such distribution with respect to Capital Securities held by the Clearing Agency or its nominee, and, (iii) any Capital Securities Certificates not held by the Clearing Agency for the Capital Securities or its nominee as specified in clause (ii) above will be deemed to represent Junior Subordinated Debentures having a principal amount equal to the stated Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities represented thereby and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Capital Securities until such certificates are presented to the Securities Registrar for transfer or reissuance.
 
(d)
 
If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debentures is not practical, or if any Early Termination Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Issuer Trust shall be dissolved and wound up and the Trust Property shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee
 
50
determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution of the Issuer Trust, unless the Trust Securities have been redeemed or are to be redeemed on such date pursuant to Article IV, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for distribution to Holders, after paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Issuer Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, an amount equal to the aggregate of Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to but excluding the date of payment (such amount being the Liquidation Distribution). If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a
pro rata
basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution
pro rata
(determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that, if a Debenture Event of Default or Debenture Default specified in Section 5.06(a) or 5.06(b) of the Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities as provided in Section 4.3.
 
SECTION 9.5. Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of the Issuer Trust.
 
 
The Issuer Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, any entity, except pursuant to this Section 9.5 or Section 9.4. At the request of the Holders of the Common Securities, and with the consent of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, the Issuer Trust may merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to a trust organized as such under the laws of any State; provided, however, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Issuer Trust with respect to the Capital Securities or (b) substitutes for the Capital Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Capital Securities (the Successor Securities) so long as the Successor Securities have the same priority as the Capital Securities with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee is appointed to hold the Junior Subordinated Debentures, (iii) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (v) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Issuer Trust, (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Issuer Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel from independent counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Issuer Trust
 
51
nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and (vii) the Depositor or any permitted transferee to whom it has transferred the Common Securities hereunder own all of the common securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of 100% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Issuer Trust or the successor entity to be taxable as a corporation, a partnership or any other arrangement other than as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
 
 
 
SECTION 10.1. Limitation of Rights of Holders.
 
 
Except as set forth in Section 9.2, the death, incapacity, dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of any Person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor dissolve or terminate the Issuer Trust, nor entitle the legal representatives, successors or heirs of such Person or any Holder for such Person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding-up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them. Any merger or similar agreement authorized in accordance with this Trust Agreement shall be executed by one or more of the Administrators on behalf of the Issuer Trust.
 
SECTION 10.2. Amendment.
 
 
(a)
 
This Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Property Trustee and the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities, without the consent of any Holder of the Capital Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Trust Agreement, provided, however, that such amendment shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Holder or (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of this Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Issuer Trust will not be taxable as a corporation, a partnership or any other arrangement other than as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes at any time that any Trust Securities are Outstanding or to ensure that the Issuer Trust will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
(b)
 
Except as provided in Section 10.2(c) hereof, any provision of this Trust Agreement may be amended by the Property Trustee and the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities with (i) the consent of Holders of at least a
 
52
Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities and (ii) receipt by the Issuer Trustees of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the Issuer Trustees in accordance with such amendment will not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation, a partnership or any other arrangement other than as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes or affect the Issuer Trusts exemption from status of an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
(c)
 
In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, without the consent of each affected Holder, this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date or (ii) restrict the right of a Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date.
 
(d)
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, no Issuer Trustee shall enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust Agreement which would cause the Issuer Trust to fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status as an investment company under the Investment Company Act or to fail or cease to qualify as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
 
(e)
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, without the consent of the Depositor and the Administrators, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation on the Depositor or the Administrators.
 
(f)
 
In the event that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is made, the Administrators or the Property Trustee shall promptly provide to the Depositor a copy of such amendment.
 
(g)
 
Neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be required to enter into any amendment to this Trust Agreement which affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Trust Agreement. The Property Trustee shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers Certificate stating that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is in compliance with this Trust Agreement.
 
(h)
 
Any amendments to this Trust Agreement, pursuant to Section 10.2(a), shall become effective when notice of such amendment is given to the Holders of the Trust Securities.
 
(i)
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation, a partnership or any other arrangement other than as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
 
SECTION 10.3. Separability.
 
 
In case any provision in this Trust Agreement or in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
53

Morgan Stanley

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation (the 
Company
), and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the 
Trust
), in connection with the preparation and filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form S-3 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the 
Registration Statement
) for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
Securities Act
) $125,452,274,876 (or the equivalent thereof in a foreign currency) aggregate initial offering price of debt securities, warrants, units, purchase contracts, depositary shares, capital securities, guarantees with respect to capital securities, preferred stock and common stock to be issued from time to time by the Company, as such amount may be increased from time to time upon due authorization by the Company, including: (1) capital securities of the Trust issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust agreement of such Trust to be entered into among the Company, as depositor of such Trust (the Company, in such capacity, the 
Depositor
), The Bank of New York, as property trustee, The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware trustee, two individuals selected by the Depositor as administrators with respect to such Trust (the 
Administrators
) and the holders of the capital securities of such Trust and (ii) guarantees of the Company with respect to such capital securities.
 
We have also acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated April 19, 2007 (the 
Underwriting Agreement
) among the Company and the several underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the 
Underwriters
). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell, and the Underwriters severally have agreed to purchase, 33,000,000 of the Trusts 6.45% Capital Securities (liquidation amount $25 per Capital Security) (the 
Capital Securities
) representing preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust under the Amended and Restated Trust
 
 
 
 
Agreement dated as of April 26, 2007 (the 
Trust Agreement
) among the Company, The Bank of New York, as property trustee, The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware Trustee, and the Administrators named therein. The Capital Securities include 3,000,000 Capital Securities purchased pursuant to the over-allotment option provided for in the Underwriting Agreement. Concurrently with the Trusts issuance of the Capital Securities, the Company will purchase 400 of the Trusts 6.45% Common Securities (liquidation amount $25 per Common Security) (the 
Common Securities
), representing common beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
 
The Trust will loan the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities to the Company and, to evidence such loan, the Company will issue and deliver to the Trust $825,010,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 6.45% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the 
Debentures
) pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of October 12, 2006 (the 
Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture
), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee.
 
In consideration for the loan of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities, the Company will guarantee the payment of certain amounts with respect to the Capital Securities to the extent set forth in the Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII Capital Securities Guarantee Agreement dated as of April 26, 2007 (the 
Guarantee
) between the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York, as guarantee trustee.
 
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records and other documents and certificates as we deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein. In such examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and the authenticity of the originals of all such latter documents. In making our examination of executed documents or documents to be executed, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company, had or will have the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and that such documents constitute valid and binding obligations of such parties.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
(1)
 
The Capital Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Trust Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and (b) is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
(2)
 
The Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the 
Trust Indenture Act
) and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and (b) is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
(3)
 
The Debentures have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture and delivered and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be entitled to the benefits of the Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and (b) is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
(4)
 
The Guarantee has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and (b) is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

D.
 
The Issuer is entering into this Replacement Capital Covenant and disclosing the content of this Replacement Capital Covenant in the manner provided below with the intent that the covenants provided for in this Replacement Capital Covenant be enforceable by each Covered Debtholder and that the Issuer be estopped from disregarding the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
 
E.
 
The Issuer acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Issuer and that, were the Issuer to disregard its covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Issuer hereby covenants and agrees as follows in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder.

Securities on or after the Scheduled Redemption Date and prior to the Final Maturity Date except to the extent that
 
(a)
 
the Issuer has obtained any prior concurrence or approval of any then Applicable Governmental Authority if such concurrence or approval is then required under any applicable capital rules and
 
(b)

Section 3
. Covered Debt.
(a
)
The Issuer represents and warrants that the Initial Covered Debt is Eligible Debt.
 
(
(b)   
i
)
During the 30-day period immediately preceding any Redesignation Date with respect to the Covered Debt then in effect, the Issuer shall identify the series of Eligible Debt that will become the Covered Debt on the related Redesignation Date in accordance with the following procedures:
 
2
(A)
 
the Issuer shall identify each series of its then-outstanding long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is Eligible Debt;
 
(B)
 
if only one series of the Issuers then-outstanding long-term indebtedness for borrowed money will be Eligible Debt as of the related Redesignation Date, such series shall become the Covered Debt on such Redesignation Date;
 
(C)
 
if the Issuer has more than one outstanding series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that will be Eligible Debt as of the related Redesignation Date, then the series that has the latest occurring final maturity date as of the related Redesignation Date shall become the Covered Debt on such Redesignation Date;
 
(D)
 
the series of outstanding long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is determined to be Covered Debt pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall be the Covered Debt for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for the period commencing on the related Redesignation Date and continuing to, but not including, the Redesignation Date as of which a new series of outstanding long-term indebtedness is next determined to be the Covered Debt pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
Section 3(b)
; and
 
(E)
 
in connection with such identification of a new series of Covered Debt, the Issuer shall give the notice provided for in
Section 4
and file with the Commission a current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act including as an exhibit or incorporating by reference this Replacement Capital Covenant within the time frame provided for in such section.
 
(c)
 
If at any time the Covered Debt is held by a Trust, a holder of the capital securities of such Trust may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Issuer for the enforcement of this Replacement Capital Covenant, and such capital securities shall be deemed to be Covered Debt so long as the Covered Debt held by the Trust remains Covered Debt.
 
Section 4

(a)
 
simultaneously with the execution of this Replacement Capital Covenant or as soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Issuer shall (x) give notice to the Holders of the Initial Covered Debt, in the manner provided in the

indenture relating to the Initial Covered Debt, of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the rights granted to such Holders hereunder and (y) file a copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant with the Commission as an exhibit to a Form 8-K under the Exchange Act;
 
 
(b)
 
so long as the Issuer is a reporting company under the Exchange Act, the Issuer shall include in each annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act a description of the covenant set forth in
Section 2
and identify the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is Covered Debt as of the date such Form 10-K is filed with the Commission;
 
 
(c)
 
within 30 days after a series of the Issuers long-term indebtedness for borrowed money (1) becomes Covered Debt or (2) ceases to be Covered Debt, the Issuer will give notice of such occurrence to the holders of such long-term indebtedness for borrowed money in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other contract or instrument under which such long-term indebtedness for borrowed money was issued and report such change in a Form 8-K filed with the Commission and the Issuers next quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K, as applicable (or any successor to such forms);
 
(d)
 
if, and only if, the Issuer ceases to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act, the Issuer shall, rather than include the relevant information in Exchange Act filings pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 4, cause a notice of the information required by clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 4 to be posted on (1) the Issuers website and (2) the Bloomberg screen for each series of Covered Debt (or any successor thereto) (each, an

) and cause a hyperlink to the execution copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant to be included on the appropriate Investor Screen; and
 
(e)
 
promptly upon request by any Holder of Covered Debt, the Issuer shall provide such Holder with a conformed copy of the executed version of this Replacement Capital Covenant.

. Termination, Amendment and Waiver.
(a
)
The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the

(1)
the date, if any, on which the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Covered Debt then in effect consent or agree to the elimination of such obligations as covenants in favor of such Holders,
(2)
the date on which the Issuer has no outstanding Eligible Debt (without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (ii) of the definition of Eligible Senior Debt and Eligible Subordinated Debt),
(3)
the Final Maturity Date, or if earlier, the date on which the Notes are otherwise redeemed in full
and (4)
the date, if any, on which an Event of Default occurs with respect to the Notes, resulting in the acceleration

the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and, if such Person initiates a claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Issuer has violated its covenants in
Section 2
and before the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Persons rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money no longer being Covered Debt). Except as specifically provided herein, this Replacement Capital Covenant shall have no other beneficiaries and no other Persons are entitled to rely on this Replacement Capital Covenant.

(f)

provided
(and it being understood) that:

the Alternative Payment Mechanism may at the discretion of the Issuer include a share cap limiting the issuance of APM Qualifying Securities consisting of Common Stock and Qualifying Warrants in each case to a maximum issuance cap to be set at the discretion of the Issuer;
provided
that such maximum issuance cap will be subject to the Issuers agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to increase the maximum issuance cap when reached, if the Issuer can do so and still satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under the securities and derivative instruments that provide for settlement or payment in shares of common stock, and (ii) if the Issuer cannot increase the maximum issuance cap as contemplated in the preceding clause, to request its board of directors to adopt a resolution for shareholder vote at the next occurring annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of shares of the Issuers authorized common stock for purposes of satisfying its obligations to pay deferred distributions;

(d)
 
if the Issuer has outstanding more than one class or series of securities under which it is obligated to sell a type of APM Qualifying Securities and apply some part of the proceeds to the payment of deferred Distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for payment of deferred Distributions on such securities shall be applied to such securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap and any maximum issuance cap referred to above, as
 
3
 
applicable, in proportion to the total amounts that are due on such securities, or on such other basis as an Applicable Governmental Authority may approve.
