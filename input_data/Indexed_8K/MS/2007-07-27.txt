(c)
  
If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy Program Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of your counsel, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, the Company will forthwith prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at the Companys own expense, to you and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; that in the case of an opinion delivered on the Commencement Date or pursuant to Section 5(b), the opinion and belief set forth in clauses 1(B), 2(B) (with respect to the Prospectus only) and 2(C) above shall be deemed not to cover information concerning an offering of particular Notes, Units or Warrants to the extent such information will be set forth in a supplement to the Basic Prospectus.

The opinions described in subparagraphs (F) and (I) need only be contained in an opinion delivered on a Settlement Date related to an offering of Units under a Unit Agreement Without Holders Obligations to be executed on or prior to such Settlement Date.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the opinions described in Sections 4(b)(i)(G) (except as to due authorization of the Notes and Cash-settled Pre-paid Purchase Contracts), 4(b)(i)(H) (except

.  (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless you and each person, if any, who controls you within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of your affiliates within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to you furnished to the Company in writing by you expressly for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
 
(b)
  
You agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to you, but only with reference to information relating to you furnished to the Company in writing by you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(c)
  
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b), such person (the ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the ) in
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
 
26
 
 
writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by you, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(d)
  
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein in connection with any offering of Program Securities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand from the offering of such Program Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 6(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and you
 
 
 
27
 
 
on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand in connection with the offering of such Program Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Program Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by you in respect thereof as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of you on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by you and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  Your obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Program Securities you have purchased in any offering of Program Securities hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)
  
The Company and you agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, you shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Securities referred to in Section 6(d) that were offered and sold to the public through you exceeds the amount of any damages that you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)
  
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Notes Terms Agreement, Units Terms Agreement or Warrants Terms Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement or any such Notes Terms Agreement, Units Terms Agreement or Warrants Terms Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of you, any person controlling you or any of your affiliates or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Program Securities.
 
7.
  
.  In acting under this Agreement and in connection with the sale of any Program Securities by the Company (other than Program Securities sold to you
Position of the Agent
 
 
28
 
pursuant to a Notes Terms Agreement, Units Terms Agreement or Warrants Terms Agreement, as the case may be), you are acting solely as agent of the Company and do not assume any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of Program Securities.  You shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Program Securities has been solicited by you and accepted by the Company, but you shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason.  If the Company shall default in its obligations to deliver Program Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall hold you harmless against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default and shall, in particular, pay to you the commission you would have received had such sale been consummated.
 
8.
  
.  If any Program Securities are to be offered outside the United States, you will not offer or sell any such Program Securities in any jurisdiction if such offer or sale would not be in compliance with any applicable law or regulation or if any consent, approval or permission is needed for such offer or sale by you or for or on behalf of the Company unless such consent, approval or permission has been previously obtained.  Subject to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement, the Company shall have no responsibility for, and you will obtain, any consent, approval or permission required by you for the subscription, offer, sale or delivery by you of Program Securities, or the distribution of any offering materials, under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which you are subject or in or from which you make any subscription, offer, sale or delivery.
Offering Restrictions

.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time either by the Company or by you upon the giving of written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto, but without prejudice to any rights, obligations or liabilities of the other parties hereto accrued or incurred prior to such termination.  The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any Notes Terms Agreement, Units Terms Agreement or Warrants Terms Agreement, and the termination of any such Notes Terms Agreement, Units Terms Agreement or Warrants Terms Agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.  If this Agreement is terminated, the provisions of the third paragraph of Section 2(a), the last sentence of Section 3(e) and Sections 3(f), 3(k), 6, 7, 10, 11 and 13 shall survive; that if at the time of termination an offer to purchase Program Securities has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent of such Program Securities has not occurred, the provisions of Sections 1, 2(b), 2(c), 3(d), 3(g), 3(h), 3(i), 3(j), 3(m), 4 and 5 shall also survive until such delivery has been made.
