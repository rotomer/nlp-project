John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, Morgan Stanleys diversification across businesses and regions helped us deliver ROE of 17.2% this quarter, despite the impact of the severe market disruption on some areas of the Firm--including our credit products, leveraged lending and quantitative strategies businesses.  Even with these turbulent markets, Morgan Stanley still delivered strong performances across many core businesses and achieved record results in our prime brokerage,
derivatives and interest rate & currencies businesses.  In addition, we continued making progress in executing our growth plans and vastly improving performance in Asset Management and Global Wealth Management.

The following (page 14) presents a reconciliation for adjusted assets.
 
Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a companys overall
liquidity and capital policies. The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial
risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends. The Company has adopted a definition
of adjusted assets that excludes certain self-funded assets considered to have minimal market, credit and/or liquidity risk.
These low-risk assets generally are attributable to the Companys matched book and securities lending businesses.
Adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed
 less non-derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). Gross assets are also reduced by the full amount of cash and securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements. The adjusted
leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill
and intangible assets (as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs).
In addition, the Company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given
the inherent characteristics of the securities. These characteristics include the long-dated nature (e.g., some have final
maturity at issuance of 30 years extendible at the Companys option by a further 19 years, others have a 60-year final maturity
at issuance), the Companys ability to defer coupon interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters and the subordinated nature
of the obligations in the capital structure. The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these securities.
