           You agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to you, but only with reference to information relating to you furnished to the Company in writing by you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(b)
 
           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either Section 6(a) or 6(b), such person (the ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the ) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by you, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any

indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein in connection with any offering of Program Securities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand from the offering of such Program Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 6(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand in connection with the offering of such Program Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Program Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by you in respect thereof as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of you on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by you and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  Your obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Program Securities you have purchased in any offering of Program Securities hereunder, and not joint.
(d)
 
           The Company and you agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, you shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Program Securities referred to in Section 6(d) above that were offered and sold to the public through you exceeds the amount of any damages that you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
(e)
pro rata
 
29
 
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
           The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, its officers and you contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Notes Terms Agreement or Units Terms Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement or any such Notes Terms Agreement or Units Terms Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of you or any person controlling you, any of your affiliates or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Program Securities.

Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such date shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day (i) by 360 if the Base Rate is CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, EURIBOR, Federal Funds Rate, Federal Funds (Open) Rate, Prime Rate or LIBOR (except if the Index Currency is pounds sterling); (ii) by 365 if the Base Rate is LIBOR and the Index Currency is pounds sterling; or (iii) by the actual number of days in the year if the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate or the CMT Rate.  All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% being rounded up to .00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward.  All Japanese Yen amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded downwards to the next lower whole Japanese Yen amount.  All amounts

denominated in any other currency used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places in such currency, with .005 being rounded up to .01.  The interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on such date.  The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate).
 
This Note and all the obligations of the Issuer hereunder are direct, unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank without preference or priority among themselves and with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, subject to certain statutory exceptions in the event of liquidation upon insolvency.

EXHIBIT 5.1
 
Morgan Stanley
1585 Broadway
New York, NY  10036
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and depositor of Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust IX and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust X, each a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (each, an "Issuer Trust" and, collectively, the "Issuer Trusts"), in connection with the preparation and filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form S-3ASR (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Registration Statement") for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") $125,452,274,876 aggregate initial offering price of the following securities, as such amount may be increased from time to time upon due authorization by the Company (the "Securities"): (i) debt securities ("Debt Securities"), (ii) warrants to purchase or sell (a) securities issued by the Company or by an entity affiliated or not affiliated with the Company, a basket of such securities, an index or indices of such securities, any other property, (b) currencies, (c) commodities or (d) any combination of the foregoing (collectively, the "Warrants"), (iii) purchase contracts ("Purchase Contracts") requiring the holders thereof to purchase or sell (a) securities issued by the Company or by an entity affiliated or not affiliated with the Company, a basket of such securities, an index or indices of such securities or any other property, (b) currencies, (c) commodities or (d) any combination of the above, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), (v) shares of the Company's preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"), to be issued from time to time in one or more series, (vi) an indeterminate number of depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares or multiple shares of the Preferred Stock (the Depositary Shares), (vii) Warrants, Purchase Contracts, Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Debt Securities and debt obligations issued by an entity affiliated or not affiliated with the Company or any combination thereof that may be offered in the form of Units ("Units"), (viii) capital securities of the Issuer Trusts (the "Capital Securities") and (ix) guarantees of the Company with respect to the Capital Securities (the "Guarantees"), and, collectively, the "Shelf Securities").
As used herein, the term "Debt Securities" includes prepaid Purchase Contracts issued under an indenture.
Certain of the Debt Securities (the Senior Debt Securities) are to be issued from time to time as senior indebtedness of the Company under a senior indenture dated as of November 1, 2004, between the Company and The Bank of New York (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (formerly known as
 
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank)) (the "Senior Debt Trustee"), as trustee (as supplemented by the First Supplemental Senior Indenture dated as of September 4, 2007 between the Company and the Senior Debt Trustee (the First Supplemental Senior Indenture) and the Second Supplemental Senior Indenture dated as of January 4, 2008 between the Company and the Senior Debt Trustee (the Second Supplemental Senior Indenture) and as may be further supplemented or amended from time to time, the Senior Indenture).
The Senior Indenture and the forms of the Senior Debt Securities are filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Registration Statement.
In rendering this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records and other documents and certificates as we deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein. In such examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and the authenticity of the originals of all such latter documents. In making our examination of executed documents or documents to be executed, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company, had or will have the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and that such documents constitute valid and binding obligations of such parties. In addition, we have assumed that the Senior Indenture and the Senior Debt Securities have been or will be executed in substantially the form reviewed by us and that the terms of the Senior Debt Securities will have been established so as not to violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or its property is subject, (ii) any law, rule, or regulation to which the Company is subject, (iii) any judicial or administrative order or decree of any governmental authority or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority.
We have examined the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such additional corporate records of the Company and such other documents and certificates as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and assuming that (i) the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments) are or will have become effective and comply with all applicable laws; (ii) the Registration Statement will continue to be effective and will comply with all applicable laws at the time the Senior Debt Securities are offered or issued as contemplated by the Registration Statement; (iii) a prospectus supplement will have been prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange

Commission describing the Senior Debt Securities offered thereby and will comply with all applicable laws; (iv) all Senior Debt Securities will be issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the appropriate prospectus supplement; (v) the Company's Board of Directors (or a committee thereof duly authorized to act on its behalf) (the "Board") and appropriate officers of the Company have taken all necessary corporate action to approve the terms of the Senior Debt Securities and the terms of the offering; and (vi) a definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement and any other necessary agreement with respect to any Senior Debt Securities offered or issued will have been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the Company and the other parties thereto; we are of the opinion that:
1. the Senior Indenture and the Senior Debt Securities have been duly authorized by the Company; and
2. when the terms of the Senior Debt Securities have been established by the officers of the Company given authority to do so by the Board and (i) the Senior Debt Securities have been duly authenticated, executed and issued in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Indenture, (ii) if the Senior Debt Securities are intended to be in NGN form, as defined in the Senior Indenture, and are not to be physically delivered to the relevant common safe-keeper (CSK) for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System, and Clearstream Banking, , the Senior Debt Securities have been effectuated by the CSK, and (iii) the Senior Debt Securities have been duly paid for by the purchasers thereof in accordance with the applicable definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement, all required corporate action of the Company will have been taken with respect to the issuance and sale of the Senior Debt Securities and such Senior Debt Securities will have been validly issued and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
socit anonyme
Our opinion in paragraph 2 above is subject to the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability.
We note that, as of the date of this opinion, a judgment for money in an action based on the Senior Debt Securities in a federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion into United States dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement and further consent to the reference to our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in each of the related prospectuses. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
                                          Very truly yours,
 
/s/ Davis Polk & Wardwell
