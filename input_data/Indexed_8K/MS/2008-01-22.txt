Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
Morgan Stanley (the Company) intends to submit a company proposal, for approval by shareholders at its 2008 annual meeting of shareholders, to amend and restate the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation), including eliminating the supermajority voting requirements necessary for shareholders to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws).  The Board of Directors has approved similar amendments to the Bylaws, to take effect upon the effectiveness of the amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation.  If the shareholders approve the company proposal, all supermajority voting requirements in both the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws will be eliminated, including any such default voting requirements applicable to the Company under the Delaware General Corporation Law.  Approval of the proposed amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the Companys outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together in a single class. This 80% vote is required under the current Certificate of Incorporation, but no 80% vote will be required for any action in the future if the company proposal is approved. Additional information regarding the company proposal, including the text of the proposed amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation, will be included in the Companys annual proxy statement, expected to be filed with the SEC and distributed to shareholders in February 2008.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
