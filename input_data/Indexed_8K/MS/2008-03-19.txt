We achieved strong results across our equities and fixed income sales and trading businesses this quarter, as we effectively capitalized on market opportunities and aggressively managed our positions.  We also delivered another solid quarter in investment banking and wealth management.  While many of our businesses are facing challenging market conditions that we expect to continue in the months ahead, we are satisfied with how Morgan Stanley navigated the ongoing market turbulence.
