John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, Given the turbulent environment this quarter, we stayed close to shore and continued strengthening the Firms capital and liquidity positions.  Average total liquidity over the course of the quarter was $135 billion and we finished the quarter with $169 billion in total liquidity.  The difficult market conditions and lower levels of client activity impacted our results, particularly in fixed income and asset management.  However, Morgan Stanleys diversified business mix benefited the Firm, with solid results in wealth management, prime brokerage, equity derivatives and our world-class international franchise.  The careful management of our capital, risk and liquidity leaves us well positioned to continue serving Morgan Stanleys clients and seize attractive risk-return opportunities as we see them.
