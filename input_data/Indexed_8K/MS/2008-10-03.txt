Designated Securities
"). Such notice shall constitute a non-binding indication of interest of Investor to purchase the Designated Securities so specified at the range of prices and other terms set forth in the Company's notice to it. The failure to respond during such 24-hour period shall constitute a waiver of preemptive rights in respect of such offering. To the extent the Company shall give the Investor notice of any such offer prior to the public announcement thereof, the Investor shall agree to confidentiality and restriction on trading terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. The failure of the Investor to agree to such terms within 24 hours (which shall not include any hours during any day that is not a Business Day) after the date and time of receipt of the Company's notice as described in this clause shall constitute a waiver of the Investor's preemptive rights in respect of such offering.
         
(b)    If the Company proposes to make a Qualified Offering of Covered Securities that is not an underwritten public offering or Rule 144A offering (a "

Such notice shall constitute a non-binding indication of interest of Investor to purchase the amount of Designated Securities so specified (or a proportionately lesser amount if the amount of Covered Securities to be offered in such Private Placement is
subsequently reduced) upon the price and other terms set forth in the Company's notice to it. The failure of the Investor to respond during the 48-hour period (which shall not include any hours during any day that is not a Business Day) referred to in the second preceding sentence shall constitute a waiver of the preemptive rights in respect of such offering. To the extent the Company shall give the Investor notice of any such offer prior to the public announcement thereof, the Investor shall agree to confidentiality and restriction on trading terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. The failure of the Investor to agree to such terms within 48 hours (which shall not include any hours during any day that is not a Business Day) after the date and time of receipt of the Company's notice as described in this clause shall constitute a waiver of the Investor's preemptive rights in respect of such offering.
         
Section 5.3    
Purchase Mechanism
.    (a)    If the Investor exercises its preemptive purchase rights provided in Section 5.2(a), the Company shall offer the Investor, if such underwritten public offering or Rule 144A offering is consummated, the Designated Securities (as adjusted to reflect the actual size of such offering when priced) at the same price as the Covered Securities are offered to the investors in such offering and shall provide written notice of such price to the Investor as soon as practicable prior to such consummation.

(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 2.4(h)(v) above, promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to such registration statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the Holders, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If the Company notifies the Holders in accordance with Section 2.4(h)(v) above to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Holders shall suspend use of such prospectus and use their commercially reasonable efforts to return to the Company all copies of such prospectus (at the Company's expense) other than permanent file copies then in such Holder& #146;s possession, and the period of effectiveness of such registration statement provided for above shall be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date Holders shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to this Section 2.4(j).

Suspension of Sales
. During any Scheduled Black-out Period and upon receipt of written notice from the Company that a registration statement, prospectus or prospectus supplement contains or may contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that circumstances exist that make inadvisable use of such registration statement, prospectus or prospectus supplement, each Investor who holds, and each Holder of, Registrable Securities shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until termination of such Scheduled Black-Out Period or until Investor and/or Holder has received copies of a supplemented or am ended prospectus or prospectus supplement, or until such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus and, if applicable, prospectus supplement may be resumed, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the prospectus and, if applicable, prospectus supplement covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. The total number of days that any such suspension (other than a suspension due to a Scheduled Black-out Period) may be in effect in any twelve-month period shall not exceed the excess of 90 days over the number of days in such twelve-month period that the Company has delayed effecting a registration in reliance on Section 2.1(c)(v).
     2.6    
Termination of Registration Rights
. The registration rights granted under this Article II shall terminate with respect to any Holder as of the last day of the first calendar month in which the sum of the Shares held by such Holder and the maximum number of Shares issuable upon conversion of other Securities held by such Holder may be sold in a single transaction without limitation under Rule 144.
     2.7     . 
Delay of Registration; Furnishing Information
     (a) Neither the Investor nor any Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek
 
an injunction 
restraining
or otherwise delaying any such
registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Article II.
     
 
(b) Neither the Investor nor any Holder shall use any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities without the prior written consent of the Company.
     
(c) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 2.1 that the selling Investor and/or Holders shall furnish to the Company such information regarding themselves, the Registrable Securities held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of their Registrable Securities.
     
(b) If the indemnification provided for in Section 2.8(a) is unavailable to an Indemnitee with respect to any losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs or expenses referred to therein or is insufficient to hold the Indemnitee harmless as contemplated therein, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determ ined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Indemnitee and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; the Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.8(b) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 2.8(a). No Indemnitee guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from the Company if the Company was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
