Securities Purchase Agreement
     
As previously announced, Morgan Stanley (the "Company") entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2008, by and between the Company and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. ("MUFG"), that was amended by the First Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of October 3, 2008 and the Second Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of October 8, 2008.
     
On October 13, 2008, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended, the "Securities Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Company and MUFG agreed to amend the Securities Purchase Agreement to provide that the Company would issue and sell to MUFG, and MUFG would purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of $9,000,000,000, (i) 7,839,209 shares of Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, having the rights, obligations and preferences set forth in an amended certificate of designations (as amended, the "Series B Preferred Stock"), at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share, and (ii) 1,160,791 shares of a newly created series of preferred stock designated the 10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock," and, together with the Series B Preferred Stock, the "Securities"), at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share. In the Third Amendment, the Company also agreed to use its best efforts to cause shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), subject to official notice of issuance, as soon as practicable. The Company further agreed to take all action necessary to convene a meeting of stockholders on or prior to February 17, 2009 to vote upon the approval of the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, to the extent required by the rules of the NYSE (the "NYSE Stockholder Approval").
     
Following execution of the Third Amendment, on October 13, 2008, the Company and MUFG completed the purchase and sale of the Securities (the "Closing"). Concurrently with the Closing, the parties entered into an Investor Agreement (the "Investor Agreement") and a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). The terms of the Investor Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement were previously described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 3, 2008 and such descriptions are incorporated herein by reference.
     
The descriptions of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Investor Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contained or incorporated herein are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Securities Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, the Investor Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and the Registration Rights Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.3 hereto, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Series B Preferred Stock
     
The terms, rights, obligations, and preferences of the Series B Preferred Stock are set forth in the Amended Certificate of Designations of Preferences and Rights of the Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Amended Series B CoD"), an executed copy of which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 13, 2008. The Amended Series B CoD amended the certificate of designations for the Series B Preferred Stock originally filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 10, 2008. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable, on a non-cumulative basis, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), in cash, at the rate per annum of 10% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, except that if the NYSE Stockholder Approval is then required for the conversion of all of the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with its terms and is not obtained by February 17, 2009, the per annum dividend rate will increase on February 17, 2009 to 13% per annum (such increase to remain in effect until the date on which the NYSE Stockholder Approval is received or is no longer required). Declared dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on January 15, 2009. The Company is prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of Common Stock or other junior securities or repurchasing or redeeming any shares of Common Stock or other junior securities in any quarter unless full dividends are paid on the Series B Preferred Stock for the then latest completed dividend period, subject to certain limited exceptions.
     
Each share of the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the then applicable Conversion Rate, except in each case to the extent any such conversion would violate any applicable NYSE stockholder approval requirements. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is initially convertible into 39.604 shares of Common Stock (the "Conversion Rate"), representing an initial "Conversion Price" of $25.25, in each case, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Conversion Rate will also be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain make-whole merger or acquisition transactions and certain fundamental changes.
     
Subject to the receipt of the NYSE Stockholder Approval, if applicable, and subject to certain ownership limits on MUFG and its affiliates, one-half of the Series B Preferred Stock will mandatorily convert into Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate when, at any time on and after the first anniversary of the Closing, the market price of the Common Stock exceeds one-hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Conversion Price for twenty (20) trading days within any period of thirty (30) consecutive trading days beginning after such first anniversary. Subject to the receipt of the NYSE Stockholder Approval, if applicable, any then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will mandatorily convert into Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate when, at any time on and after the second anniversary of the Closing, the market price of the Common Stock exceeds one-hundred fi fty percent (150%) of the Conversion Price for twenty (20) trading days within any period of thirty (30) consecutive trading days beginning after such second anniversary.
     
The Series B Preferred Stock is neither redeemable by the Company nor by MUFG. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional members of the Board if dividends have not been declared and
paid for the equivalent of six or more quarters, whether or not consecutive. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been fully paid for at least four quarters. Other than the aforementioned rights, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, including the right to elect any directors, other than limited voting rights with respect to matters affecting the rights and privileges of the Series B Preferred Stock or the creation of preferred stock senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, for the period and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended Series B CoD, MUFG will have a consent right with respect to the creation of preferred stock that is pari passu to the Series B Preferred Stock if such new preferred stock does not meet certain specified criteria.
     
The description of the Series B Preferred Stock contained herein is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Series B CoD, which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Series C Preferred Stock
     
The terms, rights, obligations, and preferences of the Series C Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designations of Preferences and Rights of the 10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series C CoD"), an executed copy of which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 13, 2008. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are payable, on a non-cumulative basis, as and if declared by the Board, in cash, at the rate per annum of 10% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Declared dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on January 15, 2009. The Company is prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of Common Stock or other junior securities or repurchasing or redeeming any s hares of Common Stock or other junior securities in any quarter unless full dividends are paid on the Series C Preferred Stock for the then latest completed dividend period, subject to certain limited exceptions.
     
The Series C Preferred Stock may not be redeemed by the Company prior to October 15, 2011. On or after October 15, 2011, subject to receipt of any then-required regulatory approvals, the Company may, at its option, redeem, in whole or in part from time to time, the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding at a redemption price equal to $1,100 per share, in addition to an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends for the lapsed period of the then-current quarter (regardless of whether any dividends are actually declared for that quarter). Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock do not have any right to require the redemption or repurchase of any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock.
     
Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional members of the Board if dividends have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more quarters, whether or not consecutive. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been fully paid for at least four quarters. Other than the aforementioned rights, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, including the right to elect any directors, other than limited voting rights with respect to matters affecting the rights and privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock or the creation of preferred stock senior to the Series C Preferred Stock.

     On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it will purchase up to $250 billion of preferred stock in a broad range of U.S. financial institutions in order "to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy." The Treasury Department also announced that it will acquire warrants to purchase common stock in connection with its purchases of the preferred stock. The terms of this program are set forth in a "TARP Capital Purchase Program" term sheet issued by the Treasury Department on October 14, 2008. Morgan Stanley has agreed to be part of the initial group of institutions in which the Treasury Department will purchase an equity stake, with the Treasury Department to invest $10 billion in Morgan Stanley under the program. Also on October 14, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced a new program, the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, under which certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by banks and bank holding companies on or before June 30, 2009 would be guaranteed until June 30, 2012. In addition, the FDIC announced that until the end of 2009, "any participating depository institution will be able to provide full deposit insurance coverage for non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount." The FDIC stated that these programs will be funded by fees charged to participating institutions. Morgan Stanley has agreed to participate in these FDIC programs.

"RESOLVED, that, pursuant to Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Designations of Rights and Preferences of the 10% Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and hereby is amended to read in its entirety as follows, and the number of shares designated as Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of the Corporation be increased from 6,045,750 to 7,839,209:"
                                     
1.    
Designation
. The distinctive serial designation of such series of preferred stock is "Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock." Each share of Series B shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series B, except as to the respective dates from which dividends thereon shall accrue, to the extent such dates may differ as permitted pursuant to Section 3 below.
 
                                     
2.    
Number of Shares.
The authorized number of shares of Series B shall be 7,839,209. Shares of Series B that are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, or converted into Common Stock or another series of Preferred Stock, shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock provided that this Section 2 shall not apply to any purchase or other acquisition of shares of Series B by any Subsidiary of the Corporation.
                                      3.    
Dividends
.
                                     
(a)   
Rate.
Holders of shares of Series B shall be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of funds of the Corporation legally available for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 10%;
provided
, that, if Stockholder Approval has not been recei ved by February 17, 2009, if such Stockholder Approval is then required for the conversion of all of the Series B without a Violation, the per annum rate shall be increased to 13% per annum on and including February 17, 2009 and shall remain in effect until the date upon which Stockholder Approval is received or no longer required. Declared dividends on the Series B shall be payable from and including the date of initial issuance (in the case of the initial Dividend Period) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date (in the case of Dividend Periods other than the initial Dividend Period), and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on January 15, 2009 (each such date a "
Dividend Payment Date
"). If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable shall not be a Busines s Day (as defined below), then the date of payment of dividends need not be made on such date, but such payment of dividends may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Dividend Payment Date, and no additional dividends shall be payable nor shall interest accrue on the amount payable from and after such Dividend Payment Date to the next succeeding Business Day. "
Business Day
" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in New York City, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to be closed.
                                     
Dividends on the Series B shall not be cumulative; Holders of Series B shall not be entitled to receive any dividends not declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend not so declared. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series B payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on that Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series B are declared for any future Dividend Period. Declared and unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.
                                     
Dividends that are payable on the Series B on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series B as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the applicable Dividend Record Date, which shall be the 15
th
calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly
 
authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a "
Dividend Record Date
"). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business Day.
                                     
The term "
Dividend Period
" means the period from and including each Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date (other than the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on and include the date of initial issuance of the Series B and shall end on but exclude the next Dividend Payment Date). Dividends payable on the Series B shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
                                     
(b)    
Priority of Dividends
. The Series B will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock (as defined below) and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series B, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series B (issued with the requisite consent of the Holders of the Series B, if required) and (iii) at least equally with each other class or series of Preferred Stock (as defined below) that the Corporation may issue with resp ect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. So long as any share of Series B remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series B has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; (ii) an exchange, redemption, recla ssification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of Junior Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business.
                                     
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series B and any shares of Parity Stock, all
 
dividends declared on the Series B and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared
pro rata
so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series B and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) bear to each other.
                                     
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series B, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series B shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends.
                                      4.    
Liquidation Rights
.
                                     
(a)   
Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation.
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, Holders of Series B shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities, if any, to creditors of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or
pari passu
with the Series B in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series B as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $1,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series B will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference.
                                     
(b)    
Partial Payment.
If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all Holders of Series B and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series B as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the Holders of Series B and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid
pro rata
in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Holders of Series B and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the "
Liquidation Preference
" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series B and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an
amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series B will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 4 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining assets.
                                     
(c)   
Residual Distributions
. If the Liquidation Preference on the Series B and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to such liquidation distribution has been paid in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences.
                                     
(d)   
Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation.

that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors; and
provided further
that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than tw o Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series B or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting.

In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four regular dividend periods following a No npayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed.
                                     
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);
provided
that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series B or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The P referred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.

Authorization of Senior Stock

In addition, any conversion of the Series B pursuant hereto shall not be deemed to adversely affect
the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B. For purposes of clarification, no Holder of Series B shall have any voting rights with respect to any binding share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation which complies with the provisions of clause (iii)(x) and (y) hereof.
                                     
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 5(c) for which a vote is otherwise required would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series B for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and otherwise entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock that are otherwise entitled to vote on the matter are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merg er or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds approval of each series that will have a diminished status and that is otherwise entitled to vote thereon.
                                     
(d)   
Changes for Clarification
. Without the consent of the holders of the Series B, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series B, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series B:
    (i)    to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate

(i)     On the Partial Mandatory Conversion Date, one half of the outstanding shares of Series B held by each Holder thereof will mandatorily convert into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate;
provided
that to the extent such conversion would result in the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Initial Holder and its affiliates exceeding the Ownership Limit (such shares of Common Stock that would exceed the Ownership Limit, the "
Excess Shares
") the number of shares of Series B of the Initial Holder so converted on the Partial Mandatory Conversion Date shall be limited to the number of shares of Series B such that after giving effect to such conversion, the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Initial Holder and its affiliates equal the Ownership Limit; and
provided further
, that to the extent that there are Excess Shares and shares of Common Stock are issued upon settlement of the equity units sold pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement after the Partial Mandatory Conversion Date and prior to the Full Mandatory Conversion Date, outstanding shares of Series B held by the Initial Holder will mandatorily convert into shares of Common Stock (but not greater than the number of Excess Shares) at the then applicable Conversion Rate provided that the number of shares of Series B of the Initial Holder so converted shall be limited to the number of shares of Series B such that after giving effect to such conversion, the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Initial Holder and its affiliates do not exceed the Ownership Limit. No action shall be required by the Holder thereof. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon mandatory conversion of Series B will be treated as the record Holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the Close of Business on the Partial Mandatory Conversion Date. Except as provided under Section 11(a)(xv), prior to the Close of Business on the Partial Mandatory Conversion Date, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B will not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose and Holders shall have no rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, including v oting rights, rights to respond to tender offers and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, by virtue of holding the Series B.
                                              
(ii)    
On the Full Mandatory Conversion Date, all of the outstanding shares of Series B will mandatorily convert into shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate. No action shall be required by the Holder thereof. The person or persons
 
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon mandatory conversion of Series B will be treated as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the Close of Business on the Full Mandatory Conversion Date. Except as provided under Section 11(a)(xv), prior to the Close of Business on the Full Mandatory Conversion Date, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B will not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose and Holders shall have no rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, by virtue of holding the Series B.

                                      (b)
Conversion Procedures for a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date.
To effect conversion on a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date, a Holder who:
                                              
(i)    
holds a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing the Series B must deliver to DTC the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to DTC's conversion program and, if required, pay funds equal to the dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled by virtue of Section 10(e) and, if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any; or
                                               holds shares of Series B in certificated form must:
(ii)    
complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the Series B certificate or a facsimile of the conversion notice;
(A)    
       
deliver the completed conversion notice and the certificated shares of Series B to be converted to the Conversion Agent;
(B)    
       
if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;
(C)    
       
if required, pay funds equal to the dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled by virtue of Section 10(e); and
(D)    
       
if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any.
(E)    
       
                                      
The conversion will be effective on the date on which a Holder has satisfied all of the foregoing requirements, to the extent applicable, which shall be the applicable Non-Mandatory Conversion Date. A Holder will not be required to pay any transfer or similar taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common Sto ck if such Holder exercises its conversion rights, but such Holder will be required to pay any transfer or similar tax or duty that
 
may be payable relating to any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of Common Stock in a name other than the name of such Holder. A certificate representing Common Stock will be issued and delivered only after all applicable taxes and duties, if any, payable by the Holder have been paid in full.
                                      
The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the Close of Business on the applicable Non-Mandatory Conversion Date. No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 11(a), shall be m ade in respect of dividends payable to Holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such applicable Non-Mandatory Conversion Date. Prior to such applicable Non-Mandatory Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Series B shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Series B.
                                      
In the event that a conversion is effected with respect to shares of Series B representing fewer than all the shares of Series B held by a Holder, upon such conversion the Corporation shall execute and the Registrar shall countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidenci ng the shares of Series B as to which conversion was not effected.
                                      
The Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock to which the Holder converting pursuant to Section 9(a) is entitled on or prior to the third Trading Day immediately following the applicable Non-Mandatory Conversion Date.

Conversion Upon Make-Whole Acquisition
.
In the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition, each Holder shall have the option to convert its shares of Series B (a "
(i)    
         
Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion
") at the then applicable Conversion Rate during the period (the "
Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Period
") beginning on the effective date of the Make-Whole Acquisition (the "
Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date
") and ending on the date that is 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date and receive an additional number of shares of Common Stock in the form of Make-Whole Shares as set forth in this Section 10(c);
provided
that, prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition shall be limited to conversion into such number of shares of Common Stock so that such conversion would not result in a Violation. The date of such Make-Whole Acqu isition Conversion is referred to herein as the "
Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Date
."
The number of "
(ii)    
          
Make-Whole Shares
" shall be determined for the Series B by reference to the table below for the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date and the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price:
 
 
        (A)    
The exact Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
        (1)     if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
        (2)     if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is in excess of $100.00 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant hereto), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series B; and
        (3)     if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than $21.375 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant hereto), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series B.
        (B)    
The Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices set forth in the table above (and the corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above) are subject to adjustment pursuant hereto and shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices (and corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above) shall equal the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices (and corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above), respectively, applicable immediately prior to such
 
adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price adjustments and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Make-Whole Shares in the table above shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11.
(iii)    
          
On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Corporation anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, within two Business Days after the Corporation becomes aware of a Make-Whole Acquisition described in clause (i) of the definition of such term), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain:
the date on which the Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be effected;
        (A)

        (D)    
(iv)    
          
To exercise a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a Holder must, no later than the Close of Business on the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under Section 10(c)(iii), comply with the procedures set forth in Section 10(b).

(vii)    
          
In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Series B or successor securities representing fewer than all the shares of Series B or successor securities held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition
 
Conversion, the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation or its successors, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series B or such successor securities held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected.
(viii)    
          
If a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series B in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition, such Holder shall not be entitled to an adjusted conversion price pursuant t o Section 10(g) to the extent such Make-Whole Acquisition also constitutes a Fundamental Change.
                                     
(d)     
Registration of Common Stock

If a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series B is after the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend and prior to the Dividend Payment Da te, such Holder shall receive that dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date if such Holder was the Holder of record at the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date for that dividend.

(g)    
Conversion Upon Fundamental Change
.
(i)    
          
If the Reference Price in connection with a Fundamental Change is less than the then applicable Conversion Price, a Holder may convert each share of Series B during the period beginning on the effective date of the Fundamental Change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of (1) the Reference Price and (2) $12.6250,
 
subject to adjustment as described herein (the "
Base Price
"),
provided
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, any conversion in connection with a Fundamental Change shall be limited to conversion into such number of shares of Common Stock so that such conversion would not result in a Violation. The date of such conversion upon a Fundamental Change is referred to herein as the "
Fundamental Change Conversion Date
."
(ii)    
          
The Base Price shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate of the Series B is adjusted pursuant hereto. The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Base Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. If the Refe rence Price is less than the Base Price, Holders shall receive a maximum of 79.2079 shares of Common Stock per share of Series B (subject to adjustment in a manner inverse to the adjustments to the Base Price).

In the event that a conversion upon a Fundamental Change is effected with respect to shares of Series B or successor securities representing fewer than all the shares of Series B or successor securities held by a Holder, upon such conversion the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporati on, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series B or such successor securities held by the Holder as to which a conversion upon a Fundamental Change was not effected.
If a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series B in connection with a Fundamental Change, such Holder shall not be entitled to Make-Whole Shares pursuant to Section 10(c) to the extent such Fundamental Change also constitutes a Make-Whole Acquisition.

Anti-Dilution Adjustments.
                                     
(a)     The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Corporation as follows:
                                             
(i)     If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a share split or share combination in
 
respect of the Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
                                     
The Corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Corporation.
                                              < /P>
(ii)     Except as otherwise provided for by Section 11(a)(iv) below, if the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the Record Date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
                                     
To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the distribution of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
                                     
In determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors.
                                             
(iii)     If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 11(a)(i) above), evidences of its indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's Capital Stock or other securities, but excluding (i) dividends or distributions as to which an adjustment under Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iv) hereof shall apply, (ii) dividends or distributions paid excl usively in Cash and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provision set forth below in this Section 11(a)(iii) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's Common Stock or other securities, hereinafter in this Section 11(a)(iii)
 
called the "
Distributed Property
"), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
                                     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP

as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each Holder on the date the Distributed Property is distributed to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such Holder to convert its shares of Series B, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date fixed for dete rmination for stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for purposes of calculating SP
0
in the formula in this Section 11(a)(iii).
                                     
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consisting of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a "
Spin-Off
"), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately
 
before the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off shall be increased based on the following formula:
                                     
Such adjustment shall occur on the 10
th
Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off (it being agreed that notwithstanding Section 9(a), the Holder of the Series B shall not be entitled to convert the Series B pursuant to an Early Conversion prior to such 10
th
Trading Day).
                                     
For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11 (a)(iii) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made ) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and 11(a)(ii) hereof with respect to such dividend or distribution
 
shall then be made), except (A) the Close of Business on the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted for "the Close of Business on the Record Date," "the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date," "after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination" and "the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) hereof.
                                              (iv)     If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, distributes rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("
Trigger Event
"): (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (y ) are not exercisable; and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 11(a)(iii) above, (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 11(a)(iii) above will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event and a distribution or deemed distribution under the terms of such rights or warrants at which time an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made in the same manner as provided for under Section 11(a)(iii) above. If any such rights or warrants are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(iv) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights or warrants had not been issued.
                                             
(v)     (1) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, makes a regular, quarterly Cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period that exceeds $0.27 (the "
Initial Dividend Threshold
"), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
The Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate;
provided
that no adjustment shall be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) of this Section 11(a)(v).
                                             
(2)     If the Corporation pays any cash dividend or distribution that is not a regular, quarterly cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
                                     
(3)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the portion of the Cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP
0
as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each Holder on the date the Cash dividend or distribution is paid to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such Holder to convert its shares of Series B, the amount of Cash such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
                                     
(4)     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 11(a)(v), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Series B becomes convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 11(a)(v), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Closing Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Series B is then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. T he above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
                                             
(vi)     If the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment of Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, where such Cash and the value of any such other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the "expiration date") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
                                     
If the Corporation or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 11(a)(vi) with respect to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrea se in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 11(a)(vi).
                                             
(vii)     For purposes of this Section 11(a) the term "
Record Date
" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any Cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of Cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such Cash, securities or othe r property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
 
          (viii)     If application of the formulas provided in Sections 11(a)(i), 11(a)(ii), 11(a)(iii), 11(a)(iv), 11(a)(v) or 11(a)(vi) above would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment (other than a readjustment as described in such sections) to the Conversion Rate shall be made except in the case of a share split or combination of the Common Stock.
                                             
(ix)     If one or more events occur requiring an adjustment be made to the Conversion Rate for a particular period, adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors to reflect the combined impact of such Conversion Rate adjustments, as set out in this Section 11(a), during such period.
                                              
(x)     Notwithstanding any of the foregoing clauses in this Section 11, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless the adjustment would result in a change in the Conversion Rate of at least 1.00%;
provided, however
, that any adjustment which by reason of this Section 11(a)(x) is not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Corporation shall make such adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1.00%, within one year of the first such adjustmen t carried forward or in connection with any conversion of Series B. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be.
                                     
No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made (i) for issuances of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation's securities or the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan, (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Se ries B was first issued, (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock, (v) for repurchases of shares of Common Stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, or (vi) for accumulated and unpaid dividends, other than as expressly contemplated by Section 11(a)(i).
                                     
No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) through (ix) above for a transaction if Holders are permitted to participate in the transaction without conversion, concurrently with the holders of Common Stock, on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines in good faith to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice to holders of Common Stock participating in the transaction.
                                     
Whenever a provision of this Certificate of Designations requires the calculation of an average of the Closing Price over a span of multiple days, the Corporation will make appropriate adjustments to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which the average is to be calculated.
 
                                             
(xi)     Upon conversion of the Series B, the Holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, any associated rights issued under any shareholder rights agreement of the Corporation that provides that each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series B at any time prior to the distribution of separate certificates representing such rights will be entitled to receive such rights unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with such rights plan, and no adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate pu rsuant to Section 11(a)(iv) hereof. If, prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants as described in Section 11(a)(iv) hereof, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
                                             
(xii)     Subject to applicable stock exchange rules and listing standards, the Corporation shall be entitled to increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the best interests in the Corporation;
provided
the Corporation has given to the Conversion Agent and DTC at least 15 days' prior notice of any such increase in the Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. Subject to applicable stock exchange rules and listing standards, the Corporation shall be entitled to increase the Conversion Rate, in addition to the events requiring an increase in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11 hereof, as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any tax to shareholders in connection with any stock dividends, subdivisions of shares, distributions of rights to purchase stock or securities or distributions of securities convertible into or exchangeable for stock hereafter made by the Corporation to its shareholders or other events.
                                             
(xiii)     Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation will issue a notice to the Conversion Agent and DTC containing the relevant information and make this information available on the Corporation's website. In addition, the Corporation shall provide upon the request of a Holder of Series B, to the extent not posted on the Corporation website, a brief statement setting forth in reasonable detail how the adjustment to the Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate.
                                              
(xiv)     For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
                                             
(xv)     If the record date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs prior to a Mandatory Conversion Date and the payment date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs after a Mandatory Conversion Date, and such dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate if such dividend or distribution does not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate but were paid prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date, then without duplication the Corporation shall deem the Holders to be holders
 
of record of Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In that case, the Holders will receive the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date together with the dividend or distribution on such shares of Common Stock so converted.
                                      12.    
Reorganization Events.
                                      (a)     In the event of:
                                               
(i)        any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person or of another Person with or into the Corporation;
                                              
(ii)       any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety;
                                              
(iii)      any statutory share exchange of the Corporation with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or
                                               (iv)     any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Corporation;
in each case in which holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock (any such event specified in this Section 12(a), a "
Reorganization Event
"), each share of Series B outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind of cash, securities and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event by a holder of one share of Common Stock that was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an affiliate of such other party (such cash, securities and other property, the "
Exchange Property
").
                                     
(b)     In the event that holders of the shares of the Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the "Exchange Property" that Holders of the Series B will be entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). The number of units of Exchange Property for each share of Series B converted following the effective date of such Reorganization Event shall be determined based on the Conversion Rate then in effect on the applicable Conversion Date, determine d as if the references to a "share of Common Stock" in this Certificate of Designations were to "unit of Exchange Property."
                                     
(c)     After a Reorganization Event, for purposes of determining whether a Mandatory Conversion Date has occurred, the term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. For purposes of this Section 12, references to Common Stock in the definition of "Trading Day" shall be replaced by references to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.
 
                                     
(d)     The above provisions of this Section 12 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
                                     
(e)     The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 12 or the validity of any Reorganization Event.
                                      13.     
Fractional Shares.
                                     
(a)     No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Series B.
                                     
(b)     In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 10(a) or a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 9(a), Section 10(c) or Section 10(g), the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of:
                                             
(i)      in the case of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 10(a), a Make Whole Acquisition conversion pursuant to Section 10(c) or a Conversion Upon Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 10(g), the average of the Closing Prices over the five consecutive Trading Day period preceding the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date; or
                                             
(ii)     in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 9(a), the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Early Conversion Date.
                                     
(c)     If more than one share of the Series B is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series B so surrendered.
                                      14.    
Reservation of Common Stock.
                                       
(a)     The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury by the Corporation, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series B as provided in this Certificate of Designations, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series B then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 14(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B shall be
 
computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
                                     
(b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Series B, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock acquired by the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such acquired shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
                                      
(c)     All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series B shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
                                     
(d)     Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series B, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority.
                                     
(e)     The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B;
provided
,
however
, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series B into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.
                                     
15.    
Record Holders.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series B may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series B as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
                                     
16.    
Notices.
All notices or communications in respect of Series B shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designations, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law.
                                     
17.    
Preemptive or Subscription Rights
. Except as expressly provided in any agreement between a Holder and the Corporation, no share of Series B shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options
 
issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted.
                                     
18.    
Repurchase
. Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell shares of Series B from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board may determine;
provided
,
however
, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.
                                      19.    
Other Rights.
The shares of Series B shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or as provided by applicable law.
 
   
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorized thereto, does hereby affirm that this certificate is the act and deed of the Corporation and that the facts herein stated are true, and accordingly has hereunto set his hand this 13th day of October, 2008.

MORGAN STANLEY, a Delaware corporation (the "
Corporation
"), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY that, pursuant to resolutions of the Preferred Stock Financing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted on October 12, 2008, the creation of 10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $1,000 per share ("
Series C
"), of the Corporation was authorized and the designation, preferences, privileges, voting rights, and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series C, in addition to those set forth i n the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation, are fixed as follows:
     
1.  
Designation
. The distinctive serial designation of such series of preferred stock is "10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock." Each share of Series C shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series C, except as to the respective dates from which dividends thereon shall accrue, to the extent such dates may differ as permitted pursuant to Section 3 below.
     
2.  
Number of Shares.
The authorized number of shares of Series C shall be 1,160,791. Shares of Series C that are purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock provided that this Section 2 shall not apply to any purchase or other acquisition of shares of Series C by any Subsidiary of the Corporation.
     3.  
Dividends
.
     
(a)  
Rate.
Holders of shares of Series C shall be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of funds of the Corporation legally available for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 10%. Declared dividends on the Series C shall be payable from and including the date of initial issuance (in the case of the initial Dividend Period) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date (in the case of Dividend Periods other than the initial Dividend Period), and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on January 15, 2009 (each such da te a "
Dividend Payment Date
"). If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then the date of payment of dividends
need not be made on such date, but such payment of dividends may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Dividend Payment Date, and no additional dividends shall be payable nor shall interest accrue on the amount payable from and after such Dividend Payment Date to the next succeeding Business Day. "
Business Day
" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in New York City, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to be closed.
     
Dividends on the Series C shall not be cumulative; Holders of Series C shall not be entitled to receive any dividends not declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend not so declared. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series C payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on that Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series C are declared for any future Dividend Period. Declared and unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.
     
Dividends that are payable on the Series C on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series C as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the applicable Dividend Record Date, which shall be the 15
th
calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a "
Dividend Record Date
"). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day i s a Business Day.
     
The term "
Dividend Period
" means the period from and including each Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date (other than the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on and include the date of initial issuance of the Series C and shall end on but exclude the next Dividend Payment Date). Dividends payable on the Series C shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
     
(b)  
Priority of Dividends
. The Series C will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock (as defined below) and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series C, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series C (issued with the requisite consent of the Holders of the Series C, if required) and (iii) at least equally with each other class or series of Preferred Stock (as defined below) that the Corporation may issue with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. So long as any share of Series C remains outstanding, no dividend or distribut ion shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding
shares of Series C has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; (ii) an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of Junior Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights p lan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business.
     
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series C and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series C and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared
pro rata
so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series C and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) bear to each other.
     
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series C, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series C shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends.
     4.   
Liquidation Rights
.
     
(a)  
Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation.
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, Holders of Series C shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities, if any, to creditors of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or
pari passu
with the Series C in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series C as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $1,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series C will not be entitled to any other amount s from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference.
     
(b)   
Partial Payment.
If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all Holders of Series C and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series C as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the Holders of Series C and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid
pro rata
in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Holders of Series C and the holders of all such other stock. In any such d istribution, the "
Liquidation Preference
" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series C and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series C will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 4 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining assets.
     
(c)  
Residual Distributions
. If the Liquidation Preference on the Series C and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to such liquidation distribution has been paid in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences.
     
(d)  
Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation.
For purposes of this Section 4, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the Holders of Series C receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
     5.   
Voting Rights.
     
(a)  
General.
The Holders of Series C shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise from time to time required by law.
     
(b)  
Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events
. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series C, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more Dividend Periods, whether or not for consecutive Dividend Periods (a "
Nonpayment
"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the "
Preferred Stock Directors
");
provided
that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors; and
provided further
that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called a t the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series C or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series C or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 10 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series C and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment.
     
If and when dividends for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series C and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series C and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed.
     
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights
described above (voting together as a single class);
provided
that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series C or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
     
The term "
Voting Preferred Stock
" means any other class or series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series C as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Voting Preferred Stock includes the Corporation's Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the "
Series A
") and the Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the "
Series B
"), in each case, if outstanding, and any class or series of Preferred Stock, whether or not cumulative, that the Corporation may issue in the future, to the extent their like voting rights are exercisable at such time. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series C and any other Voting Preferred Stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the relative liquidation preferences of the shares voted.
     
(c)  
Other Voting Rights
. So long as any shares of Series C are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series C and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating:
     
(i)   
Authorization of Senior Stock
. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series C with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;
     
(ii)  
Amendment of Series C
. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C, taken as a whole; or
     
(iii)  
Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations
. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or
reclassification involving the Series C, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series C remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding as securities of the Corporation or such other entity as permitted by clause (x) or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C, taken as a whole;
provided
,
however
, that for all purposes of this Section 5(c), the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series C with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series C. For purposes of clarification, no Holder of Series C shall have any voting rights with respect to any bindi ng share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation which complies with the provisions of clause (iii)(x) and (y) hereof.
     
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 5(c) for which a vote is otherwise required would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series C for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and otherwise entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock that are otherwise entitled to vote on the matter are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds approval of each series that will have a diminished status and that is otherwise entitled to vote th ereon.
     
(d)  
Changes for Clarification
. Without the consent of the holders of the Series C, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series C, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series C:
     
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be defective or inconsistent; or
     
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series C that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations.
     
(e)   
Changes after Provision for Redemption
. No vote or consent of the holders of Series C shall be required pursuant to this Section 5 or otherwise if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series C shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6.
     
(f)  
Procedures for Voting and Consents
. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series C (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series C is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series C and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series C are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts of the shares voted or covered by the consent.
     6.  
Redemption.
     
(a)  
Optional Redemption
. The Series C may not be redeemed by the Corporation prior to October 15, 2011. On or after October 15, 2011, subject to obtaining any then required regulatory approval, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, the shares of Series C at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $1,100 per share, together (except as otherwise provided herein below), for the purposes of the redemption price only, with an amount equal to dividends accumulated but unpaid for the then current Dividend Period at the rate set forth in Section 3 to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (regardless of whether any dividends are actually declared for that Dividend Period). The redemption price for any shares of Series C shall be payable on the redemption date to the Holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any accrued and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the Holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the Holder of record of the redeemed shares of Series C on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 3 above.
     
(b)   
No Sinking Fund
. The Series C will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series C will have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of any shares of Series C.
     
(c)  
Notice of Redemption
. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series C shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of record of the shares of Series C to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series C designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if depositary shares representing interests in the Series C are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the Holders of Series C at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a Holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series C to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such Holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price.
     
(d)  
Partial Redemption
. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series C at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either
pro rata
or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series C shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares of Series C represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares witho ut charge to the holder thereof.
     
(e)  
Effectiveness of Redemption
. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the
pro rata
benefit of the Holders of any shares of Series C so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on al l shares so called for redemption, all shares of Series C so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the Holders of the shares of Series C so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares.
     
(f)  
Regulatory
. Redemption of the Series C by the Corporation is subject to its receipt of any required prior approvals from the Federal Reserve. The Corporation hereby confirms that it is the Corporation's intention that, at the time of any redemption of the Series C, the Corporation will repay the liquidation preference of any shares of Series C redeemed in
accordance with this Section 6 only out of the net proceeds received by the Corporation or its Subsidiaries from the issuance or sale of securities which will qualify as non-restricted core capital (as such term is defined in 12 C.F.R. 225 (Appendix A)) at the time of such issuance or sale.

The failure of the Investor to agree to such terms within 24 hours (which shall not include any hours during any day that is not a Business Day) after the date and time of receipt of the Company's notice as described in this clause shall constitute a waiver of the Investor's preemptive rights in respect of such offering.

Private Placement

subsequently reduced) upon the price and other terms set forth in the Company's notice to it. The failure of the Investor to respond during the 48-hour period (which shall not include any hours during any day that is not a Business Day) referred to in the second preceding sentence shall constitute a waiver of the preemptive rights in respect of such offering. To the extent the Company shall give the Investor notice of any such offer prior to the public announcement thereof, the Investor shall agree to confidentiality and restriction on trading terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. The failure of the Investor to agree to such terms within 48 hours (which shall not include any hours during any day that is not a Business Day) after the date and time of receipt of the Company's notice as described in this clause shall constitute a waiver of the Investor's preemptive rights in respect of such offering.

(a) If the Investor exercises its preemptive purchase rights provided in Section 5.2(a), the Company shall offer the Investor, if such underwritten public offering or Rule 144A offering is consummated, the Designated Securities (as adjusted to reflect the actual size of such offering when priced) at the same price as the Covered Securities are offered to the investors in such offering and shall provide written notice of such price to the Investor as soon as practicable prior to such consummation. Contemporaneously with the execution of any underwriting agreement or purchase agreement entered into between the Company and the underwriters or initial purchasers of such underwritten public offering or Rule 144A offering, the Investor shall, if it continues to wish to exercise its preemptive rights with respect to such offering, enter into an instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company acknowledging the Investor's binding obligation to purchase the Designated Securities to be acquired by it and containing representations, warranties and agreements of the Investor that are customary in private placement transactions and, in any event, no less favorable to the Investor than any underwriting or purchase agreement entered into by the Company in connection with such offering, and the failure to enter into such an instrument at or prior to such time shall constitute a waiver of preemptive rights in respect of such offering. Any offers and sales pursuant to this Article V in the context of a registered public offering shall be also conditioned on reasonably acceptable representations and warranties of the Investor regarding its status as the type of offeree to whom a private sale can be made concurre ntly with a registered offering in compliance with applicable securities laws.
     
(b)   If the Investor exercises its preemptive rights provided in Section 5.2(b), the closing of the purchase of the Covered Securities with respect to which such right has been exercised shall be conditioned on the consummation of the Private Placement giving rise to such preemptive purchase rights and shall take place simultaneously with the closing of the Private Placement or on such other date as the Company and the Investor shall agree in writing; provided that the actual amount of Covered Securities to be sold to the Investor pursuant to its exercise of preemptive rights hereunder shall be reduced if the aggregate amount of Covered Securities sold in the Private Placement is reduced and, at the option of the Investor (to be exercised by delivery of written notice to the Company within five business days of receipt of notice of such increase), shall be increased if such aggregate amount of Co vered Securities sold in the Private Placement is increased. In connection with its purchase of Designated Securities, Investor shall, if it continues to wish to exercise its preemptive rights with respect to such offering, execute an agreement containing representations, warranties and agreements of Investor that are
substantially similar in all material respects to the agreements executed by other purchasers in such Private Placement.
     
Section 5.4  
Cooperation
. The Company and the Investor shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate the exercise of the Investor's preemptive rights hereunder, including securing any required approvals or consents, in a manner that does not jeopardize the timing, marketing, pricing or execution of any offering of the Company's securities. In the event that within 60 days of the date hereof the Company proposes to offer or sell securities in a single transaction or series of transactions for aggregate proceeds in excess of $500,000,000, the Company shall consult with Investor concerning such transaction or transactions prior to undertaking such transaction.

Limitation of Rights
. Notwithstanding the above, nothing set forth in this Article V shall confer upon the Investor the right to purchase any securities of the Company other than Designated Securities.
     
Section 5.6   
Termination of Preemptive Rights
. Anything to the contrary in this Article V notwithstanding, the preemptive right to purchase Covered Securities granted by this Article V shall not be available for any offering that commences at any time after the earlier of (i) the 30-month anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the date on which the Investor offers, sells, pledges or otherwise transfers any of the Securities that it acquired on the Closing Date or the Common Stock issued upon conversion of any Securities, or Hedges its exposure to the Common Stock, except as contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) of the second sentence of Section 4.1(a), Section 4.1(e) and Section 4.1(f).

     2.8  
Indemnification
.
                
(a)   The Company agrees to indemnify each Holder and, if a Holder is a person other than an individual, such Holder's officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates, and each person or entity, if any, that controls a Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an "
Indemnitee
"), against any and all losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of attorneys and other professionals), joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, including any pre liminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or contained in any free writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) prepared by the Company or authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder (or any amendment or supplement thereto); or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided
, that the Company shall not be liable to such Indemnitee in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration s tatement, including any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any such amendments or supplements thereto or contained in any free writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) prepared by the Company or authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with information regarding such Indemnitee or its plan of distribution or ownership interests which was furnished in writing to the Company for use in connection with such registration statement, including any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any such amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) offers or sales effected by or on behalf such Indemnitee "by means of" (as defined in Securities Act Rule 159A) a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Securities Act Rule 405) that was not authorized in writing by the Company, or (iii) the failure of any Indemnitee to deli ver or make available to a purchaser of Registrable Securities, a copy of any registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto (if the same was required by applicable law to be delivered or made available), provided that the Company shall have delivered to such Holder such registration statement, including such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein and any amendments or supplements thereto.
                
(b)   If the indemnification provided for in Section 2.8(a) is unavailable to an Indemnitee with respect to any losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs or expenses referred to therein or is insufficient to hold the Indemnitee harmless as contemplated therein, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, costs or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Indemnitee and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; the Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.8(b) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 2.8(a). No Indemnitee guilty of fraudulen t misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from the Company if the Company was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
