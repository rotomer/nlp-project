Securities Purchase Agreement
 
     As previously announced, Morgan Stanley (the Company) agreed to be part of the initial group of institutions in which the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury Department) will purchase an equity stake as a part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program. On October 26, 2008, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement - Standard Terms (the Purchase Agreement) by and between the Company and the Treasury Department pursuant to which, among other things, the Company would issue and sell to the Treasury Department, and the Treasury Department would purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000,000 (the Purchase Price), (i) 10,000,000 shares of Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the Series D Preferred Stock) and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to 65,245,759 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Common Stock), of the Company (the Warrant and, together with the Series D Preferred Stock, the Securities).
 
     Following execution of the Purchase Agreement, on October 28, 2008 (the Issue Date), the Company and the Treasury Department completed the purchase and sale of the Securities.
 
     The description of the Purchase Agreement contained or incorporated herein is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Series D Preferred Stock
 
     The terms, rights, obligations, and preferences of the Series D Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designations of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D (the Series D CoD), an executed copy of which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 28, 2008.

Declared dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on January 15, 2009. The Company is prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of Common Stock, other junior securities or preferred stock ranking with the Series D Preferred Stock or repurchasing or redeeming any shares of Common Stock, other junior securities or preferred stock ranking with the Series D Preferred Stock in any quarter unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on the Series D Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods (including the latest completed dividend period), subject to certain limited exceptions.

Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Designated Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Designated Preferred Stock.

Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof.

Any funds unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares.

w
ill at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of this Warrant, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of this Warrant

Adjustments and Other Rights

provided
, that if
more than one subsection of this Section 13 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of this Section 13 so as to resu
l
t in duplication:
(A)
 
Stock Splits, Subdivisions, Reclassifications or Combinations
. If the Company
shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding sh
ares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of the record date for suc
h
dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock which such
h
older would have owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant after such date had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date. In such event, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of
t
he record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this
 
Warrant before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y) t
h
e new number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
(B)
 
Certain Issuances of Common Shares or Convertible Securities
. Until the earlier
of (i) the date on which the Original Warranthold
er no longer holds this Warrant or any portion thereof and (ii) the third anniversary of the Issue Date, if the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock (or rights or warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable (collecti
v
ely, a 
conversion
) for shares of Common Stock) (collectively, 
convertible securities
) (other than in Permitted Transactions (as defined below) or a transaction to which subsection (A) of this Section 13 is applicable) without consideration or at a cons
ideration per share (or having a conversion price per share) that is less than 90% of the Market Price on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such shares (or such convertible securities) then, in such event:
8
 
(A)
 
the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to the date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securiti
es) (the 
Initial Number
) shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Initial Number by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding on such date and (y) the
number of additional shares of Common Stock issued (or into which convertible securities may be exercised or convert) and (B) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date and (II) the numb
e
r of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the Company for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued (or into which convertible securities may be exercised or convert) would purchase at the Market Price on the l
a
st trading day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such shares (or such convertible securities); and
(B)
 
the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
to the date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securities) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant prior to such date and the denominator of
 
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately after the adjustment described in clause (A) above.
For purposes of the foregoing, the aggregate consideration receivable by the Company in connection
with the issuance of such shares of Common Stock or convertible securities shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the net offering price (including the Fair Market Value of any non-cash consideration and after deduction of any related expenses payable
t
o third parties) of all such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such convertible securities into shares of Common Stock; and 
Permitted Transactions
shall mean issuances (i) as consideration fo
r or to fund the acquisition of businesses and/or related assets, (ii) in connection with employee benefit plans and compensation related arrangements in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice approved by the Board of Directors, (iii) in co
n
nection with a public or broadly marketed offering and sale of Common Stock or convertible securities for cash conducted by the Company or its affiliates pursuant to registration under the Securities Act or Rule 144A thereunder on a basis consistent with
c
apital raising transactions by comparable financial institutions and (iv) in connection with the exercise of preemptive rights on terms existing as of the Issue Date. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 13(B) shall become effective immediately up
o
n the date of such issuance.
(C)
Other Distributions
. In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding Ordinary Cash Dividends, dividends of its Com
m
on Stock and other dividends or distributions referred to in Section 13(A)), in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in eff
e
ct immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the principal
9
 
 
national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidenc
es of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock (such amount and/or Fair Market Value, the 
Per Share Fair
 
Market Value
) divided by (y) such Market Price on such date specified in clause (x); suc
h
 
adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares i
ssuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately precedi
n
g sentence. In the case of adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly cash dividend, the Per Share Fair Market Value would be reduced by the per share amount of the portion of the cash dividend that would constitute
 
an Ordinary Cash Dividend. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors dete
r
mines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect and the number of Shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant if
s
uch record date had not been fixed.
(D)
 
Certain Repurchases of Common Stock
. In case the Company effects a Pro Rata
Repurchase of Common Stock, then the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect i
mmediately prior to the Effective Date of such Pro Rata Repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Pro Rata Repurchase and (y) the Market Price o
f
a share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase, minus (ii) the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, a
n
d of which the denominator shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Pro Rata Repurchase minus the number of shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (ii) the Market Price per share of Common S
t
ock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this War
r
ant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase givi
n
g rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, no increase to the Exercise Price or decrease in the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warr
a
nt shall be made pursuant to this Section 13(D).
(E)
 
Business Combinations
. In case of any Business Combination or reclassification
of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 13(A)), the Warrantholder
s right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of su
c
h Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such
10
 
Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests t
h
ereafter of the Warrantholder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the Warrantholder
s right to exercise this Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to thi
s
paragraph. In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount
 
of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of a
l
l holders of the shares of common stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).
(F)
 
Rounding of Calculations; Minimum Adjustments
. All calculations under this
Section 13 shall be made to the nearest one-tent
h (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 13 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exerci
s
able shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together wi
t
h any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
(G)
 
Timi
ng of Issuance of Additional Common Stock Upon Certain Adjustments
. In
any case in which the provisions of this Section 13 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Company may defer until the
occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Warrantholder of this Warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by s
u
ch event over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock;
provided
,
however
, that the Compa
ny upon request shall deliver to such Warrantholder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Warrantholder
s right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
(H)
 
Comple
tion of Qualified Equity Offering
. In the event the Company (or any
successor by Business Combination) completes one or more Qualified Equity Offerings on or prior to December 31, 2009 that result in the Company (or any such successor ) receiving aggregate
gross proceeds of not less than 100% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Shares (and any preferred stock issued by any such successor to the Original Warrantholder under the CPP), the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the p
o
rtion of this Warrant then held by the Original Warrantholder shall be thereafter reduced by a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) 0.5 and (ii) the number of shares underlying
11
 
 
 
the Warrant on the Issue Date (adjusted to take into account all other theretofore made adjustments pursuant to this Section 13).
(I)
 
Other Events
. For so long as the Original Warrantholder holds this Warrant or
any portion thereof, if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this Section 13 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, fairly and adequately protect th
e
purchase rights of the Warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board of Directors shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and princip
l
es, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid. The Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall not be adjusted in the event o
f
a change in the par value of the Common Stock or a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company.
(J)
 
Statement Regarding Adjustments
. Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of
Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be adju

x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdiv
i
sion, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

ssue shares of Common Stock (or rights or warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable (collectively, a 
conversion
) for shares of Common Stock) (collectively, 
convertible securities
) (other than in Permitted Transactions
(as defined below) or a transaction to which subsection (A) of this Section 13 is applicable) without consideration or at a consideration per share (or having a conversion price per share) that is less than 90% of the Market Price on the last trading day
 
preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such shares (or such convertible securities) then, in such event:
8
 
           
(A)
the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to t
he date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securities) (the 
Initial Number
) shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Initial Number by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the n
umber of shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding on such date and (y) the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued (or into which convertible securities may be exercised or convert) and (B) the denominator of which shall be the sum of
(
I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the Company for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued (or into which convertible
s
ecurities may be exercised or convert) would purchase at the Market Price on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such shares (or such convertible securities); and
           
(B)
the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of the Warran
t shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the date of the agreement on pricing of such shares (or of such convertible securities) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Sto
c
k issuable upon exercise of this Warrant prior to such date and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately after the adjustment described in clause (A) above.
For purposes of the foregoing, the aggregate consideration receivable by the Company in connection with the issuance of such shares of Common Stock or convertible securities shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the net offering price (including the F
a
ir Market Value of any non-cash consideration and after deduction of any related expenses payable to third parties) of all such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such convertible securities in
t
o shares of Common Stock; and 
Permitted Transactions
shall mean issuances (i) as consideration for or to fund the acquisition of businesses and/or related assets, (ii) in connection with employee benefit plans and compensation related arrangements in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice approved by the Board of Directors, (iii) in connection with a public or broadly marketed offering and sale of Common Stock or convertible securities for cash conducted by the Company or its affiliates pu
r
suant to registration under the Securities Act or Rule 144A thereunder on a basis consistent with capital raising transactions by comparable financial institutions and (iv) in connection with the exercise of preemptive rights on terms existing as of the I
s
sue Date. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 13(B) shall become effective immediately upon the date of such issuance.
(C)
Other Distributions
. In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares
of its Common Stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding Ordinary Cash Dividends, dividends of its Common Stock and other dividends or distributions referred to in Section 13(A)), in each such case, the Exe
r
cise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the Common Stock on th
e
last trading day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the principal
 
9
 
national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading without the
right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock (such amount and/or Fair Marke
t
Value, the 
Per Share Fair
 
Market Value
) divided by (y) such Market Price on such date specified in clause (x); such
 
adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the number of Shares issuable upon the exercis
e of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the distributi
o
n giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. In the case of adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly cash dividend, the Per Share
 
Fair Market Value would be reduced by the per share amount of the portion of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon e
x
ercise of this Warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Pric
e
that would then be in effect and the number of Shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant if such record date had not been fixed.
           
(D)
Certain Repurchases of Common Stock
. In case the Company effects a Pro Rata
Repurchase of Common
Stock, then the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of such Pro Rata Repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i) the product of (x) th
e
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Pro Rata Repurchase and (y) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of
 
the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase, minus (ii) the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, and of which the denominator shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Pro Rata
 
Repurchase minus the number of shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (ii) the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect
 
such Pro Rata Repurchase. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this W
a
rrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidanc
e
of doubt, no increase to the Exercise Price or decrease in the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made pursuant to this Section 13(D).
           
(E)
Business Combinations
. In case of any Business Combination or reclassification
of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 13(A)), the Warrantholder
s right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the number of sha
r
es of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such
 
10
 
Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and in
terests thereafter of the Warrantholder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the Warrantholder
s right to exercise this Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursu
a
nt to this paragraph. In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind
 
or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the maj
o
rity of all holders of the shares of common stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).
           
(F)
Rounding of Calculations; Minimum Adjustments
. All calculations under this
Section 13 shall be made to the neares
t one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one- hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 13 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant
 
is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and t
o
gether with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
           
(G)
Timing of Issuance of Additional Common Stock Upon Certain Adjustments
. In
any case in which the provisions of this Section 13 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Company may defer until
the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Warrantholder of this Warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required
b
y such event over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock;
provided
,
however
, that the C
ompany upon request shall deliver to such Warrantholder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Warrantholder
s right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
           
(H)
Co
mpletion of Qualified Equity Offering
. In the event the Company (or any
successor by Business Combination) completes one or more Qualified Equity Offerings on or prior to December 31, 2009 that result in the Company (or any such successor ) receiving aggre
gate gross proceeds of not less than 100% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Shares (and any preferred stock issued by any such successor to the Original Warrantholder under the CPP), the number of shares of Common Stock underlying t
h
e portion of this Warrant then held by the Original Warrantholder shall be thereafter reduced by a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) 0.5 and (ii) the number of shares underlying
 
11
 
the Warrant on the Issue Date (adjusted to take into account all other theretofore made adjustments pursuant to this Section 13).
           
(I)
Other Events
. For so long as the Original Warrantholder holds this Warrant or
any portion thereof, if any event occu
rs as to which the provisions of this Section 13 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, fairly and adequately protect the purchase rights of the Warrants in a
c
cordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board of Directors shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary,
 
in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid. The Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall not be adjusted in the event of a change in the par value of the Com
m
on Stock or a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company.
           
(J)
Statement Regarding Adjustments
. Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of
Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in Section 13, the Company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Company a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Exercis
e
Price that shall be in effect and the number of Shares into which this Warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the Company shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to each Warrantholder at
 
the address appearing in the Company
s records.
           
(K)
Notice of Adjustment Event
. In the event that the Company shall propose to take
any action of the type described in this Section 13 (but only if the action of the type described in this Section 13 woul
d result in an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of this Warrant), the Company shall give notice to the Warrantho
l
der, in the manner set forth in Section 13(J), which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take place. Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect ther
e
to as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant. In the case of any action which would requir
e
the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. Failure to give such notice, or
 
any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
           
(L)
Proceedings Prior to Any Action Requiring Adjustment
. As a condition precedent
to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this Section 1
3, the Company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, New York Stock Exchange or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable
 
all shares of Common Stock that the Warrantholder is entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 13.
12
 
(M)
         
Adjustment Rules
. Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 13 shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur. If an adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder would reduce the Exercise Price to an amount below par value of the Common Stock,
t
hen such adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder shall reduce the Exercise Price to the par value of the Common Stock.
           
14.
Exchange
. At any time following the date on which the shares of Common Stock
of the Company are no longer listed or admitted to
trading on a national securities exchange (other than in connection with any Business Combination), the Original Warrantholder may cause the Company to exchange all or a portion of this Warrant for an economic interest (to be determined by the Original W
a
rrantholder after consultation with the Company) of the Company classified as permanent equity under U.S. GAAP having a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the portion of the Warrant so exchanged. The Original Warrantholder shall calculate any Fair Ma
r
ket Value required to be calculated pursuant to this Section 14, which shall not be subject to the Appraisal Procedure.
           
15.
No Impairment
. The Company will not, by amendment of its Charter or through
any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation
, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in
t
he carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Warrantholder.
 
16.
           
Governing Law
.
This Warrant will be governed by and construed in
accor
dance with the federal law of the United States if and to the extent such law is applicable, and otherwise in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State. Each of the Compan
y

the Company.

this Warrant may be waived only with the written consent of the Company and the Warranthold
er.
19.
           
Prohibited Actions
. The Company agrees that it will not take any action which would entitle the Warrantholder to an adjustment of the Exercise Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable after such action upon exercise of this W
arrant, together with
 
13
 
all shares of Common Stock then outstanding and all shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, conversion and other rights, would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by its Ch
a
rter.
           
20.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this Amendment), dated as of October 27, 2008, is made by and among Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation (the Company), and Best Investment Corporation, a limited liability company incorporated in Beijing under the Chinese laws (the Investor).
 
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Investor are parties to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2007 (the Purchase Agreement); and
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Investor have determined to amend the Purchase Agreement as set forth herein;
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the respective representations, warranties, covenants and conditions contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
(a)           Company Sale of Covered Securities.
 
If the Company offers to sell Covered Securities in a Qualified Offering, the Investor shall be afforded the opportunity to acquire from the Company, for the same price and on the same terms as such Covered Securities are offered, in the aggregate up to the amount of Covered Securities required to permit the Investors Investor Percentage Interest immediately after giving effect to the issuance of such Covered Securities (including the issuance of Covered Securities pursuant to this Section 13) to be equal to the Investors Investor Percentage Interest immediately prior to the issuance of any such Covered Securities.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the issuance of Covered Securities in a Qualified Offering involves the purchase of a package of securities that includes Covered Securities and other securities in the same Qualified Offering, Investor shall have the right to acquire a pro rata portion of such other securities, together with a pro rata portion of such Covered Securities, at
 
 
the price and on the terms that such other securities are purchased by the other purchaser or purchasers of such Covered Securities and other securities and, if the Investor chooses to acquire Covered Securities pursuant to this Section 13, it shall also acquire a pro rata portion of such other securities at such price and on such terms.
 
 
(4)   means, as of any date, the percentage equal to (i) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Investor (treating the Securities and any other securities of the Company convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock that are beneficially owned by the Investor or its Affiliates as fully converted into or exercised or exchanged for the underlying Common Stock) divided by (ii) the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (treating (x) the Securities and any other securities of the Company convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock that are beneficially owned by the Investor or its Affiliates as fully converted into or exercised or exchanged for the underlying Common Stock and (y) all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise or exchange of any other then outstanding securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, to the extent such other securities are Covered Securities sold in a Qualified Offering, as having been issued).  For purposes of this paragraph, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Securities are convertible on any date will be deemed to be the number of shares the Investor would receive upon an early settlement at the Settlement Rate of the Securities as a result of a Cash Merger.
