In recent months, the Firm has moved aggressively to further improve Morgan Stanleys position in the rapidly changing market environment  including:
John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, The global capital markets  and the financial services industry  have experienced unprecedented turmoil in the past few months.  But the people of Morgan Stanley came together as never before to lead the Firm and our clients through this challenging environment.  These exceptional market conditions profoundly impacted our performance this year, especially in the fourth quarter.  However, we still achieved three quarters of profitable results and are moving aggressively to reposition the Firm for the future  continuing to resize our business, reduce legacy assets and further strengthen our balance sheet and capital position, which today includes an industry-leading Tier-1 capital ratio.

Morgan Stanley is a premier global bank with first-class businesses, and even in these distressed markets, we still achieved record full-year results in commodities, foreign exchange and equity sales and trading, including equity derivatives, as well as strong performance in global wealth management.  The environment will continue to be challenging.  But we have successfully evolved and adapted our business across numerous cycles, and the current market dislocation gives us openings  including through our strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ  to build market share, seize new opportunities and ultimately deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

YEAR-END COMPENSATION
Given the extraordinary challenges facing the financial industry this year, the Firm's Board of Directors and senior management team have taken a number of steps regarding year-end compensation.
OTHER MATTERS
The annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was 21.0 percent, down from 24.5 percent a year ago.  The decrease in the rate reflected lower earnings and a change in the geographic mix of earnings, partly offset by an increase in the rate due to the goodwill impairment charge noted above.

During the quarter, Discover announced the settlement of its lawsuit with Visa and MasterCard.  At the time of the spin-off of Discover, Morgan Stanley and Discover negotiated an agreement that entitled Morgan Stanley to receive approximately $1.3 billion pre-tax in connection with this settlement.  However, Discover contends that Morgan Stanley is in breach of the agreement.  Morgan Stanley has filed a lawsuit to enforce this agreement.  This revenue has not yet been included in the Firms financial results.
On December 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley approved a change in the Firms fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31 of each year.  This change to a calendar year reporting cycle will begin January 1, 2009.  As a result of the change, the Company will have a December 2008 fiscal month transition period, the results of which are expected to be separately reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the new calendar first quarter ending March 31, 2009 and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for calendar year 2009.  The Company expects this change to also impact any record dates and payment dates for any dividends to be paid on the Companys common stock, as may be approved by the Board in the future, as compared to such dates in fiscal 2008.
The Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.27 quarterly dividend per common share.  The dividend is payable on February 13, 2009 to common shareholders of record on January 30, 2009.  The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $348.35 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.34835) to be paid on January 15, 2009 to preferred shareholders of record on December 31, 2008; a quarterly dividend of $25.56 per share of perpetual Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B to be paid on January 15, 2009 to preferred shareholders of record on December 31, 2008; a quarterly dividend of $25.56 per share of perpetual Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C to be paid on January 15, 2009 to preferred shareholders of record on December 31, 2008; and a quarterly dividend of $10.69 on each depository share of perpetual Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D to be paid on January 15, 2009 to preferred shareholders of record on December 31, 2008.
