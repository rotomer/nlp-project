Item 5.02(e). Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
The Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Morgan Stanley (the Company) approved the terms of the Morgan Stanley Compensation Incentive Plan (the Plan), a long-term incentive plan of the Company that provides for a participants award to be credited to an account maintained on the books and records of the Company for such participant.  The amounts in the accounts will be notionally allocated to one or more notional investments or earn interest at a fixed interest rate and will be paid in cash after vesting and other restrictions have been satisfied.  A participants account will represent at all times an unfunded, contingent and unsecured contractual obligation of the Company.
On December 18, 2008, the Committee approved grants under the Plan to certain of the Companys named executive officers, other than John Mack (Chairman and CEO), Walid Chammah (Co-President) and James Gorman (Co-President) who will receive no bonus for 2008.  These grants are subject to vesting and other restrictions similar to those applicable to the Companys equity compensation awards, including a clawback provision that could be triggered if the participant engages in certain conduct detrimental to the Company.
The above summary is qualified by the entirety of the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
