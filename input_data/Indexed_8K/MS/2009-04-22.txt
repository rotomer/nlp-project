NEW YORK, April 22, 2009  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported a net loss applicable to Morgan Stanley for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 of $177 million, or $0.57 per diluted share (reflective of preferred dividends), compared with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $1,413 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, a year ago.

John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, While challenging markets continued to impact our results this quarter, we saw improved performance across most of our businesses during the past three months.  The Firm delivered strong results in investment banking, commodities, interest rates and credit products as well as solid performance in global wealth management.  In fact, Morgan Stanley would have been profitable this quarter if not for the dramatic improvement in our credit spreads  which is a significant positive development, but had a near-term negative impact on our revenues.
 
In this volatile environment, we have focused on prudent stewardship of our balance sheet, capital and risk profiles, as evidenced by our exceptional capital ratios.  We have also moved quickly to realize attractive new opportunities including the creation of a new industry leader in wealth management with the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture as well as our new securities joint venture with MUFG.  Although the near-term environment remains challenging, we remain confident about the value we can deliver to our clients and shareholders over the long term.
The results for the quarter include a tax benefit of $331 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, resulting from the anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates.
INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES
Institutional Securities posted a pre-tax loss of $434 million, compared with pre-tax income of $1,178 million in the first quarter of last year.  Net revenues were $1.7 billion, compared with $5.1 billion a year ago.

GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP
Global Wealth Management Group posted pre-tax income of $119 million, compared with pre-tax income of $949 million in the first quarter of last year.  The results for the prior years first quarter included pre-tax income of $708 million related to the sale of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management S.V., S.A.U.  The current quarter results include net expenses of $39 million related to organizational and integration costs for the previously announced Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset Management posted a pre-tax loss of $559 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $112 million in last years first quarter.  Net revenues were $72 million, compared with $574 million a year ago.

OTHER MATTERS
The results for the quarter include the additional tax benefit noted above.  Excluding this benefit, the quarters annual effective tax rate would have been 41.1 percent, up from 29.7 percent a year ago.  The increase in the rate primarily reflected the change in the geographic mix of earnings and the anticipated use of domestic tax credits on a full-year basis.
As a result of the change in the Companys fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31, the Company had a December 2008 fiscal month transition period.  The results for this period, which reflected a net loss applicable to Morgan Stanley of $1.3 billion, are presented on page 19 of the financial supplement accompanying this release.
