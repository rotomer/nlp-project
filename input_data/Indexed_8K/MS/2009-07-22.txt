John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, "Morgan Stanley delivered improved performance across many of our businesses this quarter  including in investment banking, where we were the #1 adviser in global announced M&A, and saw strong gains in both equity and debt underwriting.  We also saw improvements from the prior quarter in prime brokerage, cash equities as well as in investment grade and distressed debt trading; and we had solid results in wealth management.  But we are not satisfied with our performance in other key areas of fixed income trading and in asset management, and we are taking steps to deliver better results in those businesses.  These initiatives include hiring to add key trading and investment management talent, expanding our client flow business, increasing capital commitments in a disciplined way and rationalizing costs in targeted areas.
 
This quarter we also saw continued improvement in our credit default spreads and were among the first banks to repurchase TARP capital  which are significant positive developments for the Firm, but nonetheless had a negative impact on our results.  Morgan Stanley would have been solidly profitable this quarter if not for these two positive developments.  As we look to realize the full benefits of the strategic initiatives we have been pursuing, we remain intensely focused on continuing to deliver innovative solutions to our clients and long-term value to our shareholders.
