Business Highlights

John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, said, Morgan Stanley continued to build momentum across our business this quarter, as we made important progress in executing key strategic initiatives.  Our investment banking business delivered particularly strong results, ranking #1 in global announced and completed M&A and showing strong performance in underwriting for both debt and equity, where we ranked #1 in global IPOs.  We also saw improvements from the prior quarter in fixed income sales and trading, commodities, prime brokerage and our wealth management business.  Although we still have work to do in sales and trading, it offers our single biggest opportunity for growth as we build out our client flow business and pursue disciplined risk-taking.  As we look to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives  including the addition of new talent in our trading businesses, the continued integration of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, and the execution of our Mitsubishi UFJ alliance  I am confident that we are well positioned to serve our clients and realize new opportunities as markets continue to recover.
