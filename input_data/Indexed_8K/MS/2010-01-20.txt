NEW YORK, January 20, 2010  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $1,149 million,compared with a loss from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley of $807 million, a year ago.  The Firm reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.93 per diluted share reflecting preferred dividends and the repurchase of TARP Capital, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $1.26 per diluted share in the prior year.  Net revenues for the year were $23.4 billion, compared with $18.2 billion in the prior year.  Net revenues in the current year included negative revenue of $5.5 billion due to the significant improvement in Morgan Stanleys credit spreads on certain of its long-term debt (debt-related credit spreads), while the prior year included positive revenue of $5.3 billion related to the deterioration of the same debt-related credit spreads.  Comparisons of current year results to the prior year were impacted by the results of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB), which closed on May 31, 2009.

Non-interest expenses were $6.2 billion, compared with $2.3 billion from last years fourth quarter.  Compensation expenses were $3.8 billion, compared with negative $0.7 billion a year ago.  Non-compensation expenses decreased 18 percent, primarily reflecting firm-wide initiatives to reduce costs, lower levels of business activity and non-cash charges of $725 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the prior year.  As noted above, comparisons of current quarter results to the prior year were impacted by MSSB.
The current year tax benefit of $336 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, primarily reflects the anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates, the anticipated use of domestic tax credits and utilization of state net operating losses.
Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley for the year was $1,346 million, or a loss of $0.76 per diluted share, compared with a net loss applicable to Morgan Stanley of $246 million, or $0.71 per diluted share a year ago.

James P. Gorman, CEO and President, said, "In a year of transition for our Firm and the entire financial services industry, the employees of Morgan Stanley delivered substantially improved financial performance while also making significant progress on critical strategic initiatives that will drive our business in the years ahead.  During the year, we closed the Smith Barney transaction earlier than expected; continued the expansion of our strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ; and forged a deal to sell Van Kampen and our retail asset management business to Invesco.  In addition, consistent with our long-term strategy to be the industry's leading client-centered franchise, we maintained strong performance in our investment banking business ranking #1 in global M&A and hired more than 350 professionals in our sales and trading business, including key senior leaders across fixed income, equities and prime brokerage, to build deeper and broader relationships with our clients.
"In the fourth quarter, we also made key changes and additions to our leadership team across our business ensuring that we have the diverse experience and complementary skills needed to continue building and strengthening our global franchise.  While the environment remains extremely fluid, we are confident the steps we have taken this year will ensure that Morgan Stanley remains well-positioned to serve our clients, seize new opportunities in the markets and deliver superior returns to our shareholders in the years ahead."

YEAR-END COMPENSATION
Morgan Stanley has over the past two years fundamentally restructured the way it pays year-end compensation to its employees  instituting a clawback provision, creating performance units tied to three-year performance for senior executives, increasing deferred compensation and reducing cash bonuses, among other changes.
As a result of these changes, year-end compensation for Morgan Stanley employees is now paid in a mix of components  including three-year performance stock units for senior executives, equity subject to market risk that vests over three years and deferred awards subject to clawback  that puts a significant portion of total compensation at risk and tied to long-term Firm performance.
