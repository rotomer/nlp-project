Morgan Stanley Reports First Quarter 2010:
NEW YORK, April 21, 2010  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported income of $1.8 billion, or $1.03 per diluted share, from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $17 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.  Net revenues were $9.1 billion for the current quarter, compared with $2.9 billion a year ago.  Net revenues in the prior years first quarter included negative revenue of $1.7 billion due to the significant improvement in Morgan Stanleys credit spreads on certain of its long-term debt (debt-related credit spreads).  The effect of changes in Morgan Stanleys debt-related credit spreads in the current quarter w as minimal.  Comparisons of current quarter results with the prior year were affected by the results of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB), which closed on May 31, 2009.  The results for this quarter also included a tax benefit of $382 million associated with prior year undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were determined to be indefinitely reinvested abroad.  The annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 17.1% in the current quarter, or 13.1% excluding the effect of the discrete tax benefit.

James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, Our intense focus on disciplined execution across Morgan Stanleys global franchise helped the Firm deliver improved results this quarter, though we still have a great deal of work to do.  Within Institutional Securities, the build-out of our Sales and Trading business is beginning to pay off across our fixed income and equity platforms.  Our client-focused investment banking franchise remains a clear industry leader  with a strong presence and deep ties around the globe  and we are working to continue broadening those client relationships.  We are driving forward key strategic initiatives, including the integration of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, where we saw the highest levels of net new assets since the fall of 2008 and historic lows in financial advisor turnover.  We also made progress in repositioning our asset management business, which delivered positive results for the quarter.  Looking ahead, I remain confident that Morgan Stanley has the right mix of businesses and talent to continue serving our clients in a first-class way and deliver strong, sustainable earnings over time.
