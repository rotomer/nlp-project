Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
The Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Morgan Stanley (the Company) approved an adjustment to the base salary of the Companys Executive Chairman, John J. Mack, consistent with the compensation strategy the Committee outlined in the Companys 2010 proxy statement to move away from a compensation program focused largely on annual incentive awards toward one that is balanced between fixed, short-term and long-term compensation and to be in line with his new role and responsibilities as Executive Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors.  Mr. Macks new base salary of $2,000,000, which is effective as of June 1, 2010, was approved by the Committee after consultation with its independent compensation consultant.  Mr. Macks base salary had not been increased since he rejoined the Company in 2005 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and he has not received any year-end compensation for 2007, 2008 and 2009.
