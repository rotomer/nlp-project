which closed on May 31, 2009.  The results for the quarter also included a tax benefit of $345 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, associated with the remeasurement of tax reserves based on the status of federal and state examinations.  The annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 12.2% in the quarter.
For the quarter net income applicable to Morgan Stanley, including discontinued operations, was $1.09 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $1.10 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.  Discontinued operations included an after-tax gain of $514 million related to the sale of substantially all of the retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments, Inc.

Compensation expenses of $3.9 billion included a charge of $361 million related to the U.K. governments payroll tax on 2009 discretionary bonuses.
5
 
Compensation expenses increased slightly from $3.8 billion a year ago as higher compensation costs related to MSSB

were mostly offset by lower compensation costs in Institutional Secur ities.  The Firms compensation to net revenue ratio for the current quarter was 49% compared with 73% a year ago.  Non-compensation expenses of $2.4 billion increased from $2.0 billion a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of MSSB.

James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, While markets were challenging this quarter, Morgan Stanley benefited from a deliberate and disciplined focus on execution.  We strengthened leading market positions in our client-focused Investment Banking business, improved client flows in Sales and Trading, and continued progress on the integration of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney as well as the repositioning of our Asset Management business.  We still have a great deal of work to do across our global franchise and anticipate that the difficult market environment may continue in the months ahead.  That said, we believe that regulatory reforms are a key step toward restoring trust in the industry and the markets.
 
 
 
INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES

Pre-tax margin and Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP measures.  Pre-tax margin represents income or loss from continuing operations before tax, divided by net revenues.  The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 capital (see note 11) less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying restricted core capital elements, adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing assets associated with MSSBs non-controlling interests divided by risk-weighted assets.  Morgan Stanley and investors utilize these measures to assess operating performance and capital adequacy.

Morgan Stanley owns 51% of MSSB, which is consolidated.  The results related to the 49% interest retained by Citigroup Inc. are reported in the net income / (loss) applicable to non-controlling interests on page 8 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.

The Core business includes traditional, hedge funds and fund of funds asset management.

The Firm calculates its Tier 1 capital ratio and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  These standards are based upon a framework described in the , July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of July 21, 2010 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
