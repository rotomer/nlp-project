Morgan Stanley Reports Third Quarter 2010:
 
 
 
NEW YORK, October 20, 2010  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported income of $313 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 compared with income of $936 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.  Net revenues were $6.8 billion for the current quarter compared with $8.5 billion a year ago.  Net revenues in the current quarter included negative revenue of $731 million related to Morgan Stanleys debt-related credit spreads (DVA)

For the quarter, the net loss applicable to Morgan Stanley, including discontinued operations, was $0.07 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.38 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, reflecting a loss of $229 million due to a write-down and related costs associated with the planned disposition of Revel Entertainment Group, LLC.

Compensation expenses of $3.7 billion decreased from $4.9 billion a year ago.  The decline primarily reflected lower compensation costs in Institutional Securities.  The Firms compensation to net revenue ratio for the current quarter was 54% compared with 58% a year ago.  These ratios were higher as a result of negative DVA, which reduced net revenues in both periods.  Non-compensation expenses of $2.3 billion increased from $2.1 billion a year ago, primarily due to ongoing investments in technology.
Separately, the Firm announced today a restructuring of its ownership of FrontPoint Partners LLC (FrontPoint) whereby FrontPoint senior management and portfolio managers will own a majority equity stake in FrontPoint and Morgan Stanley will retain a minority stake.  FrontPoint will replace Morgan Stanley affiliates as the investment advisor and general partner of the FrontPoint funds.  The restructuring is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2010.  
 
Third Quarter Business Highlights

James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Although we continued to make progress across some key businesses this quarter, our results in aggregate clearly do not reflect the true potential of Morgan Stanley's global client franchise and I am not satisfied with our overall performance.  Our Sales and Trading business was clearly muted; however, we delivered broad-based strength in Investment Banking and improved performance - and positive flows - in both Wealth Management and Asset Management.  We continue to invest in our people and our platform, and we are executing our client-focused strategy, including the plans we announced today regarding our FrontPoint business.  While we still have considerable work to do across the Firm, Morgan Stanley's client franchise remains well positioned to benefit as the environment stabilizes and investors return to the market."
