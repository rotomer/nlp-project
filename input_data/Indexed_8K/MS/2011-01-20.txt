Compensation expenses of $16.0 billion increased from $14.4 billion a year ago.

The Firms compensation to net revenue ratio for the current year was 51% compared with 62% a year ago.  These ratios were adversely affected by DVA, which reduced net revenues in both periods.

Full Year Business Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Morgan Stanley delivered improved performance across most of our businesses during the fourth quarter, and the strength of our premier client franchise was evidenced by participation in virtually every major transaction that helped raise capital for governments and leading corporations across the globe.  Despite this years challenging markets, we delivered strong results in Investment Banking enhancing our leadership positions in M&A, global equity and IPOs based on the strength of our banking, capital markets and equities teams.  While we made progress in building out our Fixed income business through investments in both people and technology, there is more to be done to drive revenue and market share growth.  In Global Wealth Management, the strong performance we delivered in the fourth quarter  and the strong net new asset growth we achieved during 2010  are the clearest signs yet of the important progress we have made in integrating Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.  Our Asset Management business also delivered significantly improved performance this year, as we refocused the business around our core strengths, hired key talent and addressed legacy issues. 
 
Throughout 2010, we continued driving forward a wide range of important strategic initiatives  from the launch of our Japanese joint venture with Mitsubishi and the sale of our CICC stake to the planned separation of our Process Driven Trading business and the sale of our Invesco shares.  I am pleased with the progress we made this year, but there is a great deal of work to do across Morgan Stanleys global franchise as we look to deliver first-class service to our clients and long-term value to our shareholders and employees," Gorman added.

For 2010, Morgan Stanley again significantly increased the portion of year-end compensation that is deferred and subject to clawback, while reducing the portion paid in cash.  For year-end compensation, the average amount subject to deferral increased to 60% in 2010 from 40% in 2009.  For members of the Operating Committee, the average amount subject to deferral increased to more than 80% in 2010 from 75% in 2009.
