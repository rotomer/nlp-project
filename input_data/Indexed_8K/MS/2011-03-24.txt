We, as your special counsel, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
 
Based upon the foregoing, we advise you that, in our opinion, when the specific terms of a particular series of Notes have been duly authorized and established in accordance with the Senior Debt Indenture; and such Notes have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the Senior Debt Indenture and the applicable underwriting or other distribution agreement against payment therefor, such Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith), that we express no opinion as to the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above
provided
.
 
In connection with the opinion expressed above, we have assumed that, at or prior to the time of the delivery of any such Note, (i) the Board of Directors shall have duly established the terms of
 
 
 
 
 
such Note and duly authorized the issuance and sale of such Note and such authorization shall not have been modified or rescinded; (ii) the Company shall remain validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; (iii) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall not have been terminated or rescinded; (iv) the Senior Debt Indenture and the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and are each valid, binding and enforceable agreements of, each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company); and (v) there shall not have occurred any change in law affecting the validity or enforceability of such Note.  We have also assumed that none of the terms of any Note to be established subsequent to the date hereof, nor the issuance and delivery of such Note, nor the compliance by the Company with the terms of such Note will violate any applicable law or public policy or will result in a violation of any provision of any instrument or agreement then binding upon the Company, or any restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
In connection with our opinion above, we note that, as of the date of this opinion, a judgment for money in an action based on Notes payable in foreign currencies in a federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars.  The date used to determine the rate of conversion of the foreign currency in which a particular Note is payable into United States dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment.  However, if a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes were entered by a New York court, such court would enter the judgment in the foreign currency.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission on the date hereof and its incorporation by reference into the Registration Statement.  In addition, if a pricing supplement relating to the offer and sale of any particular Note or Notes is prepared and filed by the Company with the Commission on this date or a future date and the pricing supplement contains a reference to us and our opinion substantially in the form set forth below, this consent shall apply to the reference to us and our opinion in substantially such form:
 
In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special counsel to the Company, when the notes offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and issued by the Company and authenticated by the trustee pursuant to the Senior Debt Indenture, and delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith), that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustees authorization, execution,
provided
 
 
 
 
 
delivery and, with respect to the notes, authentication, of the Senior Debt Indenture and the notes and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the Senior Debt Indenture and notes with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the letter of such counsel dated March 24, 2011, which has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K by the Company on March 24, 2011.  [This opinion is also subject to the discussion, as stated in such letter, of the enforcement of notes denominated in a foreign currency.]
 
In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
