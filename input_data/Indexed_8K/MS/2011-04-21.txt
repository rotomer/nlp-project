Morgan Stanley Reports First Quarter 2011:
NEW YORK, April 21, 2011  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported income of $966 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011 compared with income of $1.8 billion, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.  Net revenues were $7.6 billion for the current quarter compared with $9.1 billion a year ago.  Results for the current quarter included a pre-tax loss of $655 million (after-tax loss of $425 million or $0.26 per diluted share) arising from the Firms 40% stake in a Japanese securities joint venture (Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. or MUMSS) controlled and managed by our partner, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG).  The current quarter also included a net tax benefit of $447 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, from the remeasurement of a deferred tax asset and the reversal of a related valuation allowance that are both associated with the sale of Revel Entertainment Group, LLC (Revel).

Compensation expenses of $4.3 billion decreased from $4.4 billion a year ago.  The Firms current quarter compensation to net revenue ratio was adversely affected by the aforementioned MUMSS loss, which reduced net revenues by $655 million.  This ratio for the current quarter was 57% (or 52% excluding the MUMSS loss) compared with 49% a year ago.  Non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion compared with $2.1 billion a year ago reflecting higher levels of business activity and increased legal and technology-related expenses.

For the current quarter, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley, including discontinued operations, was $0.50 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.99 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.

James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We continued to strengthen our client franchise and delivered solid results across many of our businesses.  Our premier investment banking franchise remains a clear industry leader  maintaining our #1 ranking in global M&A in a robust deal market.  We also made gains in key areas of focus  with our best results in equities since the financial crisis; significant improvement in fixed income and commodities from last quarter; and positive flows across wealth management and asset management.  While the loss at our joint venture with MUFG is disappointing, we remain strongly committed to the Japanese market and our strategic partners at MUFG.  Further, this loss does not impact the progress we are making in pursuing our own strategic priorities.  I am confident that Morgan Stanley is well-positioned to seize the opportunities presented by todays market environment and deliver long-term value to our clients, shareholders and employees."
 
Net revenues for 1Q 2011, 4Q 2010 and 1Q 2010 include positive (negative) revenue from DVA of ($189) million, ($945) million and $54 million, respectively.

As of March 31, 2011, Morgan Stanley had not repurchased any shares of its common stock as part of its capital management share repurchase program.
 
Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement between MUFG and Morgan Stanley, MUFG is responsible for ensuring that MUMSS remains adequately capitalized, and Morgan Stanley is not obligated to contribute additional capital to MUMSS.  As a result of the losses incurred by MUMSS, MUFG announced that it is intending to contribute in April approximately $370 million of capital to MUMSS.  The MUFG capital injection will improve the capital base and restore the capital adequacy ratio of MUMSS, and will partially mitigate, to the extent of approximately $145 million, the reduction in Morgan Stanleys book value that results from the MUMSS losses.
At March 31, 2011, book value per common share was $31.45, based on 1.5 billion shares outstanding.
 
OTHER MATTERS
Excluding the discrete tax gain related to Revel and the effect of the MUMSS loss, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the current quarter was 27.6%.

The income tax benefit associated with this deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance was originally recognized in income from discontinued operations in 2010 in connection with the recognition of a $1.2 billion loss due to write-downs and related costs following the Firm's commitment to a plan to dispose of Revel.  Morgan Stanley recorded the valuation allowance because the Firm did not believe it was more likely than not that it would have sufficient future net capital gain to realize the benefit of the expected capital loss to be recognized upon the disposal of Revel. During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the disposal of Revel was restructured as a tax-free like kind exchange and the disposal was completed. The restructured transaction changed the character of the future taxable loss to ordinary.  Morgan Stanley reversed the valuation allowance because the Firm believes it is more likely than not that it will have sufficient future ordinary taxable income to recognize the recorded deferred tax asset.  In accordance with the applicable accounting literature, this reversal of a previously established valuation allowance due to a change in circumstances was recognized in income from continuing operations.

The Firms compensation to net revenue ratio, excluding the MUMSS loss, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers a useful measure for the Firm and investors to assess operating performance.  The 52% ratio is computed as compensation and benefits costs divided by net revenues, less the MUMSS loss of $655 million.

Pre-tax margin and Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers to be useful measures that the Firm and investors use to assess operating performance and capital adequacy.  Pre-tax margin represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes, divided by net revenues.  The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 capital (see note 12) less qualifying perpetual preferred stock and qualifying restricted core capital elements, such as qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying non-controlling interests, adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MSSB) non-controlling interests divided by risk-weighted assets.

Effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the Institutional Securities fixed income business has been renamed the fixed income and commodities business. The interest rates credit and currency (IRCC) business has been renamed the fixed income business. These name changes did not affect current or previously reported results for these businesses.

Morgan Stanley owns 51% of MSSB, which is consolidated.  The results related to the 49% interest retained by Citigroup Inc. are reported in net income (loss) applicable to non-controlling interests on page 9 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.

Results for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 included pre-tax income of $28 million and $116 million, respectively,  related to principal investments held by certain consolidated real estate funds.  The limited partnership interests in these funds are reported in net income (loss) applicable to non-controlling interests on page 11 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.

Beginning this quarter, the Asset Management business segment was organized into three businesses, including Traditional Asset Management, Real Estate Investing and Merchant Banking.  Traditional Asset Management includes Long-Only, Liquidity and Alternative Investment Partners fund of funds businesses.  Real Estate Investing was previously reported as part of Merchant Banking.  Merchant Banking includes Private Equity and Infrastructure businesses and hedge fund investments.  The Firms equity investment in FrontPoint, subsequent to the restructuring of that business, on March 1, 2011, is included in Merchant Banking.  The results of FrontPoint for all periods prior to the restructuring are also included in Merchant Banking.

The Firm calculates its Tier 1 capital ratio and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  These standards are based upon a framework described in the , July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of April 21, 2011 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.  On March 31, 2011, the Federal Reserve implemented a limit on the amount of the restricted core capital elements (trust preferred securities and certain non-controlling interests) to 15% of the sum of all core capital elements, including restricted core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability.  This restriction resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of restricted capital being reclassed from Tier 1 capital to Tier 2 capital for March 31, 2011.
