For the current quarter, income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.2 billion compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year quarter.  The earnings per share calculation for the current quarter included a negative adjustment of approximately $1.7 billion, or $1.02 per diluted share, related to the previously announced conversion of the Firms Series B Preferred Stock, held by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG), into common stock.  After considering this negative adjustment, the Firm reported a loss of $0.38 per diluted share,from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley for the current quarter compared with income of $0.80 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.

Ltd.

For the current quarter, the net loss applicable to Morgan Stanley, including discontinued operations, was $0.38 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1.09 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010.

James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "While global markets remained challenging this quarter, the Firm delivered higher year-over-year revenues across our three major business segments.  Within Institutional Securities, our premier investment-banking franchise ranked #1 in global completed M&A during the quarter and had the highest second-quarter revenues since 2007.  Equities achieved further client gains as revenues rose despite a fall in overall market volumes, while Fixed Income showed continued progress and Wealth Management delivered its highest revenues and FA productivity since the MSSB joint venture was formed and had positive flows, as did Asset Management.  With respect to costs, our re-engineering initiative and additional expense management efforts underscore our focus to ensure that shareholders benefit from our progress.  We also completed the previously announced preferred stock conversion with MUFG, resulting in a one-time, non-cash charge this quarter but removing a significant yearly dividend payment and boosting the Firms Tier 1 common ratio to an industry-leading level.  With this additional capital cushion and the clear momentum across our main businesses, we are well positioned to help our clients navigate the constantly changing markets and create additional value for our shareholders."
 
 
Net revenues for 2Q 2011, 1Q 2011 and 2Q 2010 include positive (negative) revenue from DVA of $244 million, ($189) million and $750 million, respectively.

CAPITAL
As previously announced, on June 30, 2011 MUFG exchanged all of its shares of Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock into Morgan Stanley common stock.  MUFG received approximately 385 million shares of the Firms common stock, including approximately 75 million shares resulting from the adjustment to the conversion ratio pursuant to the transaction agreement.  As a result of the adjustment to the conversion ratio, the Firm incurred a one-time, non-cash negative adjustment of approximately $1.7 billion in its calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six month periods ending on June 30, 2011.  This negative adjustment, which was recorded in retained earnings, did not affect Morgan Stanleys period end common equity as of June 30, 2011 because it was entirely offset by an increase in common stock and paid-in capital.  As a result of the conversion, MUFG did not receive the previously declared dividend that would otherwise have been payable on July 15, 2011 in respect of the Series B Preferred Stock.
Morgan Stanleys Tier 1 capital ratio, under Basel I, was approximately 16.8% and Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 14.6% at June 30, 2011.  The Firms Tier 1 common ratio increased 290 basis points during the current quarter. Approximately 270 basis points of this increase was a result of the MUFG transaction.

At June 30, 2011, book value and tangible book value per common share were $30.17 and $26.61, respectively, based on 1.9 billion shares outstanding.  Book value and tangible book value per common share were reduced by approximately $2.29 and $1.41, respectively, due to the increase in period end common shares outstanding resulting from the MUFG preferred stock conversion.
OTHER MATTERS
The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the current quarter was 27.9%.
Morgan Stanleys Board of Directors declared on July 19, 2011 a $0.05 quarterly dividend per common share.  The dividend is payable on August 15, 2011 to common shareholders of record on July 29, 2011.

Pre-tax margin and Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers to be useful measures that the Firm and investors use to assess operating performance and capital adequacy.  Pre-tax margin represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes, divided by net revenues.  The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 capital (see note 9) less qualifying perpetual preferred stock and qualifying restricted core capital elements, such as qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying non controlling interests, adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with MSSB non controlling interests divided by risk-weighted assets.

These computations are preliminary estimates as of July 21, 2011 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
