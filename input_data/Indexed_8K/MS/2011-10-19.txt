Risk Weighted Assets and Capital Ratios
 
At December 31, 2010, March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, Morgan Stanley (the Company) applied a capital treatment for OTC derivatives collateral that reduced the Companys overall Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) based on regulatory reporting guidance received from the Federal Reserve. In October 2011, the Company was advised by the Federal Reserve that, based on their further review concerning the application of pre-existing regulatory policy, the Company should adjust its capital treatment for OTC derivatives collateral. In all circumstances, the Companys calculations have been done consistent with Federal Reserve guidance.
 
The following table provides adjusted RWA amounts and capital ratios, under Basel I, on the basis of the further clarification from the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2010, March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011:
 
 
On October 18, 2011, the Company filed updated reports for the three periods noted above reflecting the revised RWAs and capital ratios.
Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies  FR Y-9C
 
Neither the original capital treatment, nor the revision, carry through to Basel III, and as such, the Companys previously provided estimates of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III, currently and by the end of 2012, are not impacted.
 
Tier 1 common ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy.  For a discussion of Tier 1 common ratio, see Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Balance Sheet in the Companys Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings.

The Firms compensation expense for the current quarter was $3.7 billion with a compensation to net revenue ratio of 37%.  This ratio was affected by DVA which increased net revenues in the current period.

James P. Gorman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Morgan Stanley effectively navigated turbulent markets while consolidating our market share gains with Institutional clients and demonstrating resilience across the Global Wealth Management business as evidenced by record net new assets flows since the formation of MSSB.  The Firm delivered progress across many of our key initiatives, increasing client penetration in equity derivatives and interest rate products as well as achieving a significant milestone in the integration of MSSB with the initial roll out of our new technology platform.  With our robust liquidity, diverse funding, strong capital and unique strategic partnership with MUFG, Morgan Stanley is well positioned to deliver for clients in the long term.

At September 30, 2011, book value and tangible book value per common share were $31.29 and $27.79, respectively, based on approximately 1.9 billion shares outstanding.

Pre-tax margin and Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers to be useful measures that the Firm and investors use to assess operating performance and capital adequacy.  Pre-tax margin represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes, divided by net revenues.  The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 capital (see note 10) less qualifying perpetual preferred stock and qualifying restricted core capital elements, such as qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying non controlling interests, adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with MSSB non controlling interests divided by risk-weighted assets.

Morgan Stanley owns 51% of MSSB, which is consolidated.  The results related to the 49% interest retained by Citigroup Inc. are reported in net income (loss) applicable to non controlling interests on page 9 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.

Results for the third quarter of 2011 and 2010 included a pre-tax loss of $17 million and pre-tax income of $195 million, respectively, related to principal investments held by certain consolidated real estate funds.  The limited partnership interests in these funds are reported in net income (loss) applicable to non controlling interests on page 11 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.

Results for the current quarter included losses of $13 million compared with gains of $203 million in the prior year quarter related to principal investments held by certain consolidated real estate funds.

The Firm calculates its Tier 1 capital ratio and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  These standards are based upon a framework described in the , July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I.  The definition of Tier 1 common equity may evolve in the future as regulatory rules may be implemented based on a final proposal regarding non controlling interest as initially presented by the Basel Committee.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of October 19, 2011 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
10
International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards
 
Tangible common equity and Tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company considers to be useful measures of capital adequacy.  Tangible common equity equals common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction and including only the Companys share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets.  Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding.
11
 
The quarter ended September 30, 2010 included a tax gain of $176 million associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated.  Excluding the discrete tax gain, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 19.1%.
