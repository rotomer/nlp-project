Morgan Stanley Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2011:
NEW YORK, January 19, 2012  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported income of $4.2 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with income of $4.5 billion, or $2.45 per diluted share, a year ago.  Net revenues were $32.4 billion for the year compared with $31.4 billion a year ago.  Results for the year included positive revenue of $3.7 billion, or $1.34 per diluted share, compared with negative revenue of $873 million a year ago related to changes in Morgan Stanleys debt-related credit spreads and other credit factors (Debt Valuation Adjustment, DVA).  The Firm executed several key strategic actions in 2011 which affected earnings including: the conversion of the Firms Series B Preferred Stock held by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) into common stock which resulted in a negative adjustment to earnings per share of approximately $1.7 billion, the previously announced settlement with MBIA (MBIA) which resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.7 billion and the restructuring of the sale of Revel Entertainment Group, LLC (Revel) which resulted in a net tax benefit of $447 million.  In addition, results for the current year also included a pre-tax loss of approximately $783 million arising from the Firms 40% stake in a Japanese securities joint venture (Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. or MUMSS) controlled and managed by our partner, MUFG.

Full Year Business Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
James P. Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "For the past year, Morgan Stanley has made enormous progress by addressing a number of outstanding strategic and legacy issues.  These included the conversion of MUFGs preferred investment into common stock and the settlement with MBIA.  Importantly, we also achieved market share gains across our institutional businesses, as well as significant net flows into our Global Wealth Management and Asset Management platforms.  We ended the year in better shape than where we started and we are well positioned to deliver improved returns to shareholders in 2012 and beyond."

As of December 31, 2011, the adjusted number of global representatives under this harmonized methodology was 17,649.  See page 10 of Morgan Stanley's Financial Supplement accompanying this release for prior quarter global representative headcount and productivity metrics reflecting this adjustment.

The Firm calculates its Tier 1 capital ratio and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  These standards are based upon a framework described in the , July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of January 19, 2012 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.

International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards
 
  On December 30, 2011, the final rule issued by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) adopting amendments to Regulation Y became effective.  In the final rule, the Federal Reserve Board formalized regulatory definitions for Tier 1 common capital and the Tier 1 common ratio.  The Federal Reserve Board defined Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital less non-common elements in Tier 1 capital, including perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interest in subsidiaries, trust preferred securities and mandatory convertible preferred securities.  Previously, the Firms definition of Tier 1 common capital included all of the items noted in the Federal Reserve Boards definition, but it also included an adjustment for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with MSSBs noncontrolling interests (i.e., Citis share of MSSBs goodwill and intangibles).  The Firms conformance to the Federal Reserve Boards definition under the final rule reduced the Tier 1 common ratio by approximately 130 basis points at December 31, 2011.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of January 19, 2012 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
14
 
Tangible common equity and Tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers to be useful measures of capital adequacy.  Tangible common equity equals common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction and including only the Firms share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets.  Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding.
15
 
The income tax provision / (benefit) from continuing operations included discrete tax gains of approximately $500 million and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
