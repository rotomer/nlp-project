Income (loss) per diluted share amounts, excluding DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for investors to allow better comparability of period to period operating performance.  Such exclusions are provided to differentiate revenues associated with Morgan Stanley borrowings, regardless of whether the impact is either positive, or negative, that result solely from fluctuations in credit spreads and other credit factors.  The reconciliation of income (loss) per diluted share from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders and average diluted shares from a non-GAAP to GAAP basis is as follows (shares and DVA are presented in millions):

From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise.  For these purposes, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines a non-GAAP financial measure as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.  These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference with such comparable GAAP financial measure.

Sales & Trading net revenues, including Fixed Income and Commodities (FIC) and Equity Sales & Trading net revenues excluding DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for investors to allow better comparability of period to period operating performance.  The reconciliation of Sales & Trading, including FIC and Equity Sales & Trading net revenues from a non-GAAP to GAAP basis is as follows (amounts are presented in millions):

The Firm recognized an out of period pre-tax gain of approximately $300 million in Institutional Securities Other Sales and Trading net revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, related to the reversal of amounts recorded in cumulative other comprehensive income due to the incorrect application of hedge accounting on certain derivative contracts previously designated as net investment hedges of certain foreign, non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries.  This amount included a pre-tax gain of approximately $191 million related to the quarter ended March 31, 2012, with the remainder impacting prior periods.  The Firm has evaluated the effects of the incorrect application of hedge accounting, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that it did not have a material impact on any prior annual or quarterly consolidated results.  In addition, the Firm has recognized a partially offsetting pre-tax loss of approximately $224 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, resulting from fair value changes within the quarter of the related derivative positions not qualifying for net investment hedge accounting.

The compensation to net revenue ratio is calculated as compensation expense of $1,425 million divided by net revenues of $3,234 million.  Excluding DVA, the denominator is decreased by $350 million.  The compensation to net revenue ratio excluding DVA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers to be a useful measure that the Firm and investors use to assess operating performance.

12
 
The aggregate pre-tax income from continuing operations, including the pre-tax gain from the sale of Quilter in discontinued operations, after the noncontrolling interest allocation to Citigroup Inc., is a non-GAAP measure that the Firm considers useful for investors to better understand the components of net income applicable to Morgan Stanley.

Transactional revenues include investment banking, principal transactions - trading and commissions and fee revenues.
14
 
Results for the second quarter of 2012 and 2011 included pre-tax income of $22 million and $91 million, respectively, related to principal investments held by certain consolidated real estate funds.

The Firm calculates its Tier 1 capital ratio and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  These standards are based upon a framework described in the , July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I.  In accordance with the Federal Reserve Boards definition, Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less non-common elements in Tier 1 capital, including perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interest in subsidiaries, trust preferred securities and mandatory convertible preferred securities.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of July 19, 2012 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.

International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards
 
Tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers to be useful measures of capital adequacy.  Tangible common equity equals common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction and includes only the Firms share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets.  Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding.
