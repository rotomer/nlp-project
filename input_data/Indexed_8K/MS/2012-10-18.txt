Business Overview
 
 
 
 
 
James P. Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, Our third quarter results show a balanced, strategically focused franchise that has attained stronger revenues and executed on key goals.  The rebound in Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading indicates that clients have re-engaged after the uncertainty of the rating review in the previous quarter.  We are beginning to unlock the full potential of the Global Wealth Management franchise, having increased our ownership of, and agreed on a purchase price for the rest of, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.  I am confident in our potential to enhance profitability and increase value for our shareholders in the quarters ahead.

Represents the change in the fair value of certain of Morgan Stanleys long-term and short-term borrowings resulting from fluctuations in its credit spreads and other credit factors (commonly referred to as DVA).

From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain "non-GAAP financial measures" in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise.  For these purposes, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines a "non-GAAP financial measure" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.  These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference with such comparable GAAP financial measure.

Income (loss) per diluted share amounts, excluding DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for investors to allow better comparability of period to period operating performance.  Such exclusions are provided to differentiate revenues associated with Morgan Stanley borrowings, regardless of whether the impact is either positive, or negative, that result solely from fluctuations in credit spreads and other credit factors.  The reconciliation of income (loss) per diluted share from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders and average diluted shares from a non-GAAP to GAAP basis is as follows (shares and DVA are presented in millions):

Pre-tax margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for investors to assess operating performance.  Pre-tax margin represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes, divided by net revenues.

Global Wealth Managements pre-tax margin was adjusted for approximately $193 million of non-recurring costs associated with the MSWM integration and the purchase of an additional 14% stake in the Joint Venture.  The non-recurring items reflected approximately $176 million of non-compensation and $17 million of compensation related expenses, reported in the Global Wealth Management business segment.

The Firm completed the purchase of the additional 14% stake in the Joint Venture from Citi on September 17, 2012 for $1.89 billion.  At September 30, 2012, the Firm holds a 65% stake in the Joint Venture.  The Firm must use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals required to purchase the remaining 35% stake in the Joint Venture by June 1, 2015.  Due to the terms of the revised agreement with Citi, at September 30, 2012, the Firm reclassified approximately $4.3 billion of non-redeemable noncontrolling interests to redeemable noncontrolling interests on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.

VaR represents the loss amount that one would not expect to exceed, on average, more than five times every one hundred trading days in the Firm's trading positions if the portfolio were held constant for a one-day period. Effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, the Firm enhanced its VaR model to make it more responsive to current market conditions while maintaining a longer-term perspective. The model has been approved by the Firms regulators for use in the Firms regulatory capital calculations. VaR has been recast for all periods to reflect this enhancement. Further discussion of the calculation of VaR and the limitations of the Firm's VaR methodology will be disclosed in Part I, Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" included in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Refer to page 8 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release for the VaR disclosure.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2012, Morgan Stanley completed the purchase of an additional 14% stake in the Joint Venture from Citi, increasing the Firms interest from 51% to 65%.  Prior to September 17, 2012, Citis results related to its 49% interest were reported in net income (loss) applicable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests on page 10 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.  Due to the terms of the revised agreement with Citi, subsequent to the purchase of the additional 14% stake, Citis results related to the 35% interest are reported in net income (loss) applicable to redeemable noncontrolling interests on page 10 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.

Transactional revenues include investment banking, principal transactions - trading and commissions and fee revenues.
14
 
Results for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011 included pre-tax income of $50 million and a pre-tax loss of $17 million, respectively, related to principal investments held by certain consolidated real estate funds.  The limited partnership interests in these funds are reported in net income (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interests on page 12 of Morgan Stanleys Financial Supplement accompanying this release.
15
 
Results for the current quarter included gains of $51 million compared with losses of $13 million in the prior year third quarter related to principal investments held by certain consolidated real estate funds.
16
 
The Firm calculates its Tier 1 capital ratio and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  These standards are based upon a framework described in the , July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I.  In accordance with the Federal Reserve Boards definition, Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less non-common elements in Tier 1 capital, including perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interest in subsidiaries, trust preferred securities and mandatory convertible preferred securities.  These computations are preliminary estimates as of October 18, 2012 (the date of this release) and could be subject to revision in Morgan Stanleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012.
17
International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards
 
Tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers to be useful measures of capital adequacy. Tangible common equity equals common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction and includes only the Firms share of the Joint Ventures goodwill and intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding.
18
 
The Firm recognized an out of period net income tax provision of approximately $82 million in the Institutional Securities business segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, primarily related to the overstatement of tax benefits associated with repatriated earnings of a foreign subsidiary in 2010.  The Firm has evaluated the effects of the understatement of income tax provision both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that it did not have a material impact on any prior annual or quarterly consolidated results.
