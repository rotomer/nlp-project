Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL Financial Statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it is expected that this will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business information in general).
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium of over 170 organizations originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"). XBRL International held its first public meeting in the Fall of 1999 and 13 "charter" companies (one of which was Microsoft) came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that was to become XBRL. The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies or dictionaries. For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy. XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system. Please see the "Instructions" for additional information.
 
Instructions
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the original Microsoft XBRL XML files:
