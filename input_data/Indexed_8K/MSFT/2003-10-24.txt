Revenue
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was $8.22 billion, an increase of 6% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing for Server and Tools products along with 20% growth in Home and Entertainment revenue and 15% growth in MSN revenue.
 
Consolidated Operating Income
 
Operating income of $3.15 billion grew 4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. The growth in operating income reflected an increase of $469 million in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $349 million in operating expenses, primarily related to Home and Entertainment product costs, employee-related costs associated with additional headcount, and increased legal costs including certain settlement expenses.
 
Product Revenue
 
Microsoft's seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue was $2.81 billion in the first quarter, flat with revenue from the first quarter of the prior year, reflecting flat reported license growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company completed its transition to new licensing terms under which OEMs are billed for products when Certificates of Authentication (COAs) are acquired rather than upon PC shipment, resulting in reported licenses related to inventory accumulation.
Client
 
consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Total Server and Tools revenue grew 15% to $1.87 billion in the first quarter, driven in part by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and in part by growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $214 million or 18% from the prior year's first quarter as a result of revenue earned from previously billed multi-year licensing agreements and new server shipment sales. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $37 million or 16% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $10 million or 5%.
Server and Tools
 
includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, LiveMeeting, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 1% from the prior year's first quarter. Revenue for the quarter excluded $137 million of revenue deferred for technology guarantees provided to customers who purchased Office in first quarter of fiscal 2004. Revenue from OEM licensing of Office products grew 30% from the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
Information Worker
 
includes Microsoft Great Plains; Navision; and bCentral. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $128 million, a 21% increase compared to $106 million in the prior year's first quarter. The revenue increase of $22 million was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision products.
Microsoft Business Solutions
includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. MSN revenue totaled $491 million in the first quarter compared to $427 million in the prior year's first quarter. MSN Subscription revenue declined $17 million or 6% reflecting a decrease in the number of subscribers. MSN Network services revenue grew $81 million or 51% as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions.
MSN
 
includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. First quarter revenue totaled $53 million, compared to $28 million in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing.
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $581 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 20% from $485 million in the prior year's first quarter. Xbox revenue increased $53 million or 20% from the prior year's first quarter, with $85 million related to higher volumes of Xbox consoles, peripherals, and games offset by a $32 million decrease related to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games increased $43 million or 19% compared to a year ago.
Home and Entertainment
 
Foreign Currencies Impact
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the first quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's comparable quarter been in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $165 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Operating Expenses
 
The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Headcount-related costs in operating expenses include equity compensation. At September 30, 2003, 1.48 billion vested and unvested options were outstanding, compared to 10.81 billion common shares outstanding. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company granted stock awards for 57 million shares of stock, a significant portion of which are performance-based awards. The award of 57 million shares of stock under these awards is subject to vesting and, in the case of the performance-based stock awards, achievement of target performance over a three year period. Total equity compensation costs included in operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $1.02 billion, compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year's comparable quarter.
 
was $1.48 billion, or 18.0% of revenue, in the first quarter, compared to $1.34 billion, or 17.4% of revenue, in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, resulted primarily from a 27% increase in Home & Entertainment costs, due to increased Xbox console units sold partially offset by lower costs of producing the Xbox console and an 11% increase in product support and consulting services.
Cost of revenue
 
expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $1.61 billion, 19.6% of revenue, a decrease of 6% in absolute dollar terms over the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $62 million or 4% decrease in headcount-related costs, $20 million or 32% decrease in intellectual property rights amortization, and a $16 million or 14% decrease in third party product development costs.
Research and development
 
expenses were $1.51 billion in the first quarter, or 18.3% of revenue, compared to $1.42 billion in the first quarter of the prior year, or 18.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to a 22% increase in headcount-related expenses, primarily from additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium sales forces, partially offset by lower other sales expenses.
Sales and marketing
 
costs were $471 million in the first quarter compared to $252 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased in the first quarter primarily from higher legal costs including certain settlement costs and headcount-related expenses.
General and administrative
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other consists of Microsoft's share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other decreased to $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, from $22 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003. The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
Dividends and interest declined moderately, mainly due to the $62 million AT&T dividend earned in the prior comparable quarter and offset somewhat by higher interest income earned on investments.
 
Net gains (losses) on sales of investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $18 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $434 million in the first quarter of the prior year, which accounted for the majority of the increase to investment income.
 
Net gains attributable to derivative instruments were $34 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to losses of $347 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 which were driven mainly by the impact of decreasing interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments.
 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2003 decreased $768 million from June 30, 2003 reflecting a sequential decrease in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements, deferral of revenue associated with technology guarantees for Office System 2003, and recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods. Of the $8.25 billion of unearned revenue at September 30, 2003, $2.62 billion is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.95 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.38 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, $665 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and $1.63 billion thereafter.
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $51.62 billion as of September 30, 2003. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $3.42 billion, compared to $6.17 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The decrease reflects a $2.12 billion decline in cash flow from unearned revenue resulting from a decline in multi-year contract billings. Cash used for financing was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $2.96 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. This decrease in cash used from the prior year primarily reflected a $2.45 billion decrease in cash used for stock repurchases. The Company repurchased 43.3 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in the first quarter, compared to 120.6 million shares repurchased in the prior year. Cash used for investing was $3.75 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $2.85 billion from the prior year due to greater sales of investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
