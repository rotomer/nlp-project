On November 15, 2005, the Company amended the Microsoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan, previously known as the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain and Bonus Deferral Program (the "Plan"). The Plan was amended to comply with recent guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, to expand the class of eligible employees, to enable participants to defer base salary and certain other types of compensation in addition to bonuses, and to revise the distribution provisions. The amendments also eliminate the ability to defer stock option gains. The amendments will be effective for compensation earned on and after January 1, 2006.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
