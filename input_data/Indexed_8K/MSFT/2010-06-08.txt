Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
June 8, 2010
 Microsoft Corp. today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2013 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Microsoft expects to grant the initial purchasers a 13-day option to purchase up to $100,000,000 principal amount of additional convertible notes to cover over-allotments, if any.
REDMOND, Wash.  June 8, 2010
Prior to March 15, 2013, the convertible notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft's common stock or a combination thereof, at Microsoft's election. On or after March 15, 2013, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time.
The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the convertible notes will be determined by negotiations between Microsoft and the initial purchasers of the convertible notes.
In connection with the pricing of the convertible notes, Microsoft expects to enter into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers in the convertible notes offering or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes. The option counterparties have advised Microsoft that, in connection with the initial hedging by them or their respective affiliates of the capped call transactions, they expect to enter into various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to Microsoft's common stock and/or purchase shares
 
of Microsoft's common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with or following the pricing of the convertible notes, and they expect to modify their hedge positions by purchasing or selling shares of Microsoft's common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to Microsoft's common stock and/or the convertible notes during the term of the convertible notes. Any of these activities could have the effect of increasing, preventing a decline in or, in the case of any hedge modification, adversely impacting the price of Microsoft's common stock and/or the value of the convertible notes.
Microsoft expects to repurchase shares of its common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. Any such repurchases could also affect the price of Microsoft's common stock.
Microsoft intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of convertible notes to repay short-term debt.
.
This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities. The offer and the sale of the convertible notes and the shares of common stock underlying the convertible notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and the convertible notes and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements
