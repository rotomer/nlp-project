Microsoft Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Form 8-K/A as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 17, 2011 ("Original Filing"). The Original Filing reported the voting of results its 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on November 15, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting"). The sole purpose of this Form 8K/A is to disclose the Company's decision as to how frequently it will conduct future shareholder advisory votes on named executive officer compensation ("say on pay"). No other changes have been made to the Original Filing.
 
At the Annual Meeting, shareholders cast over 84% of votes in favor of holding future say on pay votes on an annual basis. The Board of Directors of the Company had recommended a vote for annual frequency of say on pay votes. In light of this result and other factors it considered, the Board has determined that the Company will hold future say on pay votes on an annual basis until the next advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay votes occurs. The next advisory vote regarding the frequency of say on pay votes is required to occur no later than the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
