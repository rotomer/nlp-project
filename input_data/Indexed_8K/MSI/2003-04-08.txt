Executive Summary:
    Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, Motorola will be making changes in the presentation format of its financial statements in order to align more closely with the financial statement presentation of other technology companies. In doing so, Motorola will reclassify royalty income and certain expense items between the following lines in its
Consolidated Statements of Operations: Net sales; Costs of sales; Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses;
and
Research and development (R&D) expenditures
. As a result, certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported quarterly and annual financial information for 2002 and 2001 so the statement lines are comparable to the 2003 presentation.
These reclassifications do not change the Company's historical GAAP operating earnings (loss), net earnings (loss) or earnings (loss) per share. This Form 8-K is being furnished to assist investors in making accurate comparisons of the Company's historical 2002 and 2001 financial information with future financial information.
Detailed Explanation:
    Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, Motorola will reclasify royalty income and certain expense items between certain lines in its
Consolidated Statements of Operations
. As a result, certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported quarterly and annual financial information for 2002 and 2001 so the statement lines are comparable to the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications are reflected in the financial statements that are attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. The following paragraphs describe these reclassifications.
Reclassification of Income/Expense Items between Statement Lines:
Royalty Income:
    Royalty income will be included in
Net sales
and will no longer be included as an offset to
SG&A expenses
. Costs incurred in generating royalty income will be included in
Costs of sales
and will no longer be included in
SG&A expenses
.
Fringe Benefits:
    Certain employee fringe benefit costs for direct labor employees and employees in R&D functions will be included in
Costs of sales
and
R&D expenditures
, respectively, and will no longer be included in
SG&A expenses
.
Production Planning Costs:
    Certain costs associated with production planning activities will be included in
Costs of sales
and will no longer be included in
SG&A expenses
.
Engineering Support for Production Activities:
    Certain costs associated with providing engineering support for production activities will be included in
Costs of Sales
and will no longer be included in
R&D expenditures
.
As a result of the reclassifications discussed above, GAAP results in the historical
Consolidated Statements of Operations
were impacted as follows:
For 2002:
Net sales
increased $600 million, from $26.7 billion to $27.3 billion
Costs of sales
increased $369 million, from $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion
SG&A expenses
increased $269 million, from $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion
R&D expenditures
decreased $38 million, from $3.8 billion to $3.7 billion
Operating loss
is at ($1.8) billion
unchanged
Net loss

unchanged
Diluted loss per common share

For 2001:
Net sales
increased $613 million, from $29.9 billion to $30.5 billion
Costs of sales
increased $460 million, from $22.7 billion to $23.1 billion
SG&A expenses
increased $196 million, from $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion

unchanged
Diluted loss per common share

unchanged
Adjustments to Historical Orders for Motorola's Segments:
    In connection with the reclassification of royalty income to
Net Sales
, the Company will also include royalty income in its periodic measurements of
Orders
for the Company's operating segments. As a result, certain adjustments have been made to previously reported segment
Orders
for 2002 and 2001 so the historical
Orders
are comparable to the 2003 presentation. These adjusted segment
Orders
are reflected in Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.
Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Not to be Treated as a "Special Item":
    Motorola has periodically provided financial information relating to certain "special items" that impact the operating results of the Company and its operating segments. Historically, the amortization of acquired intangibles was included as a special item. Due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002, effective January 1, 2003, Motorola will no longer include amortization of acquired intangibles as a special item for either the Company or any of its operating segments. Accordingly, the reclassified
Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the four quarters and full years 2002 and 2001 that are attached to this Form 8-K as part of Exhibit 99.1 no longer include expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangibles under the column entitled "Special Items". As a result, special items associated with
SG&A expenses
, as reflected in the reclassified
Consolidated Statements of Operations
are reduced by $56 million in 2002 and are reduced by $40 million in 2001. The majority of the expenses for amortization of acquired intangibles in 2002 and 2001 were in the Company's Broadband Communications segment, which had expenses of $38 million in 2002 and $16 million in 2001. The
Special Items Description
that is included in Exhibit 99.1 also excludes the expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangibles and, accordingly, does not include the $56 million in expenses for 2002 or the $40 million in expenses for 2001 described above. Supplemental information relating to this change in treatment of expenses for amortization of acquired intangibles, including reclassified financial statements of
Segment Operating Earnings (Loss)
and tables of segment
Special Items Description
can be found on Motorola's website at www.motorola.com/investor.
This Form 8-K is being furnished to assist investors in making accurate comparisons of the Company's historical 2002 and 2001 financial information, as presented in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations
and related
Segment Information
tables, with future financial information. In addition to GAAP results, the reclassified
Consolidated Statements of Operations
reflect non-GAAP measurements of Motorola's results of operations, which are presented on a basis excluding special items and certain exited businesses. The reclassified
Segment Information
tables are presented on a basis excluding certain exited businesses. Investors and management use these ongoing results of operations, excluding special
items, to measure Motorola's current and future financial performance. The non-GAAP measurements do not replace the presentation of Motorola's GAAP financial results. These measurements provide supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing Motorola's financial position and results of operations. Motorola has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means to emphasize the results of core on-going operations. Special items include employee severance costs, fixed asset impairments, litigation-related charges, investment impairments, goodwill/intangible asset impairments, in-process research and development charges, other unusual charges and gains on sales of investments and businesses.
Exhibit 99.1, which is attached hereto, contains the following reclassified financial information for the four quarters and full years of 2002 and 2001: (i) 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
reflecting GAAP results with a reconciliation to ongoing operations excluding special items; (ii) 
Segment Information
tables reflecting GAAP results with a reconciliation to ongoing operations, and (iii) 
Special Items Description
tables.
Exhibit 99.2, which is attached hereto, contains adjusted
Orders
for each of Motorola's operating segments for the four quarters and full years of 2002 and 2001.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
