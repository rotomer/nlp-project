Explanatory Note:
 
This Form 8-K reflects the reclassification of the results of Next Level Communications, Inc. ("Next Level"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, from the Other Products segment ("Other Products") to the Broadband Communications segment ("BCS").
 
 
 
Item 12. Results of Operation and Financial Condition
 
The information in this Form 8-K is furnished under "" in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216. The information in this Form 8-K and the Exhibits attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 12 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
Historically, Next Level's results have been reported as part of Motorola's Other Products segment. However, during the first quarter of 2004, for strategic business reasons, senior management has made a decision to realign the operations of Next Level within BCS. Accordingly, BCS's senior management now assumes full responsibility for Next Level's operations and, as a result, the financial results of Next Level will be included within the financial results of BCS.
Explanation:
 
This 8-K is being filed in order to assist investors in making accurate comparisons of the Company's historical 2003 and 2002 segment financial information with future financial information. Reclassifications have been made to previously-reported quarterly and annual segment financial information for 2003 and 2002 so that the segments are comparable to the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications reflect the transfer of Next Level's financial results from Other Products to BCS.
 
As a result of the reclassifications discussed above, the historical segment results were impacted as follows:
 
For 2003:
increased by $112 million, from $1.75 billion to $1.86 billion.
Segment net sales for BCS
decreased by $112 million, from $435 million to $323 million.
Segment net sales for Other Products
worsened by $86 million, from $48 million to ($38) million.
Segment operating earnings (loss) for BCS
improved by $86 million, from ($130) million to ($44) million.
Segment operating loss for Other Products
 
For 2002:
increased by $56 million, from $2.09 billion to $2.14 billion.
Segment net sales for BCS
decreased by $56 million, from $486 million to $430 million.
Segment net sales for Other Products
worsened by $66 million, from ($150) million to ($216) million.
Segment operating loss for BCS
improved by $66 million, from ($280) million to ($214) million.
Segment operating loss for Other Products
