Motorola Announces Record Fourth-Quarter
Sales and Earnings From Continuing Operations
 
 
SCHAUMBURG, Ill.  18 January 2005  Motorola, Inc. (NYSE: MOT) today reported record sales, on a continuing operations basis, of $8.84 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $1.9 billion or 27 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2003, and reported earnings from continuing operations of $.28 per share versus $.18 per share in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2004 on a continuing operations basis, the company reported sales of $31.3 billion, an increase of $8.2 billion, or 35 percent, from the prior year, and reported earnings of $.91 per share versus $.39 per share in 2003. During the year the company strengthened its balance sheet, reduced its total debt
1
by $2.7 billion and ended the year with a record net cash
1
position of $5.4 billion.
 
"We are extremely pleased with the increases in sales and earnings we achieved this quarter," said Ed Zander, chairman and CEO. "The results reflect our renewed sense of urgency around quality and customer satisfaction and the ability to provide world-class, compelling new products. The response from customers worldwide to our portfolio of new products and technologies continues to be enthusiastic and is giving us market share growth in several areas. Importantly, the market share resurgence of the Personal Communications Segment in the fourth quarter strengthened Motorola's number two position in the wireless handset industry. We also successfully completed the full separation of our former semiconductor business into a fully-independent, publicly-traded company, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc."

Integrated Electronic Systems Segment sales were $703 million, up 5 percent compared with the year-ago quarter.
