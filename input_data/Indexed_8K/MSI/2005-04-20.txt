"We continue to see positive responses to Motorola's innovative products and Seamless Mobility solutions from around the world. As a result, we achieved important market share gains in many of our businesses and in key high-growth geographies.

Operating Results
sales in the first quarter of 2005 were $4.4 billion, up 6 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $440 million, compared with $406 million in the year-ago quarter. The business delivered record first-quarter unit shipments, sales and operating earnings. Sales, operating earnings and market share were up as a result of "must-have" products that combine innovative style, leading technology and quality.
Mobile Devices Segment
sales were $1.7 billion, up 15 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, due to strong performance in North America and the EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa) region. Operating earnings were $234 million, compared with $116 million in the year-ago quarter.
Networks Segment
 
sales were $1.5 billion, up 4 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $167 million, compared with $209 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in operating earnings was driven by lower earnings in the automotive electronics business, which was caused by weak industry conditions for North American automotive manufacturers.
