Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On July 27, 2005 the independent directors of the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board"), in executive session, approved, effective July 27, 2005, an amendment to the employment agreement ("Employment Agreement") between the Company and Edward J. Zander, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, dated as of December 15, 2003, as amended, reducing Mr. Zander's requirement to purchase 100,000 shares of Motorola common stock ("Shares") by July 31, 2005 to 75,000 Shares, for the following reasons.
     Mr. Zander has already purchased 75,000 Shares and currently holds an additional 758,637 Shares and Share equivalents of Motorola restricted stock and Motorola restricted stock units. The Board believes that Mr. Zander's current holdings of 833,637 Shares and Share equivalents fully align his interest with that of the Company's shareholders and that the purchase of the remaining 25,000 Shares by July 31, 2005 is not necessary.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
