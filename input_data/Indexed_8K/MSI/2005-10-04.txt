Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
Motorola, Inc. has previously discussed its intention to implement various productivity improvement plans aimed principally at reducing costs in its supply-chain activities, as well as reducing other operating expenses. On September 30, 2005, final decisions were made to implement actions that will result in pre-tax charges in the third quarter of 2005 totaling approximately $70 million of severance charges and $20 million of asset impairments. All four of Motorola's business segments, Mobile Devices, Networks, Government & Enterprise Mobility Solutions, and Connected Home Solutions, as well as various corporate functions are impacted by these plans. The Company anticipates that cash payments of approximately $70 million in severance benefits will begin in the third quarter of 2005 and continue through the second quarter of 2006.
