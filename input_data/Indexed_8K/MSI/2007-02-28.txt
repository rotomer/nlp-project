Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On February 22, 2007, Mr. H. Laurance Fuller and Ms. Indra Nooyi each advised the Board of Directors of Motorola, Inc. (the "Company") of their decision not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the Company's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Fuller and Ms. Nooyi will continue to serve as directors of the Company until the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is currently scheduled for May 7, 2007. Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, the size of the Board has been reduced to 11, effective at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Mr. Fuller, 69, is retiring one year in advance of the mandatory retirement age of 70 set forth in the Company's Board Governance Guidelines. Ms. Nooyi's decision not to stand for re-election is due to her becoming Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo, Inc. on October 1, 2006 and, as recently announced, Chairman on May 2, 2007, and the resulting additional responsibilities of these positions.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
