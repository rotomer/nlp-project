Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
During the first half of 2007, Motorola, Inc. (the "Company") announced cost-reduction initiatives, including planned workforce reductions, aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. In connection with these initiatives, during the first half of 2007, the Company took charges of $221 million representing severance costs for approximately 4,100 employees.
During the third quarter of 2007, in connection with such previously announced workforce reductions, the Company has taken specific actions that will result in severance costs relating to approximately 1,000 employees. The result will be a net pre-tax charge in the third quarter totaling approximately $83 million (comprised of $92 million in charges associated with the cost-reduction initiatives described above and $9 million in reversals for accruals from prior periods that are no longer needed). All three of the Company's business segments, as well as various corporate functions, are impacted by these plans. The majority of the employees affected in the third quarter are located in Germany.
Also, during the third quarter of 2007, in connection with these cost-reduction initiatives, the company expects a pre-tax charge of approximately $39 million relating to fixed asset impairments. Accordingly, the total net pre-tax charge is expected to be approximately $122 million in the third quarter of 2007.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
