Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the second sentence of paragraph 3 and paragraphs 4, 7, 9 and 10 under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company.
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any
Notice and Procedures.
provided
provided
further
 
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission
Contribution.
 
to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls the Underwriters within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same right to contribution as the Underwriters, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
     (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
     8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement

Termination
 
makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
 
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     11. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and, if the laws of such jurisdictions are not preempted by federal law, the preparation and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.; and (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors.
Payment of Expenses
.
     (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, other than solely as the result of a material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States as provided for in Section 9(iv), (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
     12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.

     Such counsel shall also state that they have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company and with representatives of its independent accountants and counsel at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the applicable effective date of the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact
 
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the Underwriting Agreement) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements, financial data and schedules included therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief).
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of Jeffrey A. Brown described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.

EXHIBIT 4.1
     THIS NOTE IS A GLOBAL NOTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITARY. THIS NOTE IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR NOTES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE (OTHER THAN A TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY) MAY BE REGISTERED EXCEPTED IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
     Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Issuer (as defined below) or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
     MOTOROLA, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer", which term includes any successor corporation under the Senior Indenture hereafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the Issuer may from time to time designate, the principal sum of FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS on November 15, 2012, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest, semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2008, on the original principal amount hereof at said office or agency, in like coin or currency, at the rate per annum specified in the title of this Note, from the May 15 or the November 15, as the case may be, next preceding the date of this Note to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, unless the date hereof is a date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, in which case from the date of this Note, or unless no interest has been paid on the Notes (as defined below) or duly provided for, in which case from November 1, 2007, until payment of the principal amount hereof has been made or duly provided for; provided, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Issuer by check mailed by first class mail to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after May 1 or November 1 as the case may be, and before the following May 15 or November 15, this Note shall bear interest from such May 15 or November 15; provided, that if the Issuer shall default in the payment of interest due on such May 15 or November 15, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding May 15 or November 15, to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes or duly provided for, from November 1, 2007. The interest so payable on any May 15 or November 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Senior Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such May 15 or November 15. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
 
     This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Senior Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Motorola, Inc. has caused this instrument to be signed by one of its duly authorized officers and has caused a facsimile of its corporate seal to be affixed hereunto or imprinted hereon.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to a Senior Indenture dated as of May 1, 1995 (herein called the "Senior Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Senior Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any) and may otherwise vary as provided in the Senior Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as the 5.375% Senior Notes due November 15, 2012 (the "Notes") of the Issuer. The Notes are initially limited in aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000; provided, however, that the Issuer may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional notes ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise similar in all respects so that such further notes would be consolidated and form a single series of the Notes.
     Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, this Note will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Note will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, and ownership of this Note shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
Optional Redemption
     The Notes shall be redeemable at the option of the Issuer, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (each a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the Redemption Date, or (ii) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 0.25% (25 basis points). The redemption price shall be calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to the relevant Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record date according to their terms and the provisions of the Senior Indenture.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the
 
remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, or their respective successors, as may be appointed from time to time by the Issuer; provided, however, that if the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and each of their respective successors (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Issuer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon shall be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, the Issuer shall assume a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
 
     Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on the notes, or portions thereof, called for redemption. On or before the Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
Change of Control
     If a change of control repurchase event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above, the Issuer shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any change of control repurchase event or, at the option of the Issuer, prior to any change of control, but after the public announcement of the change of control, the Issuer shall mail a notice to each holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the change of control repurchase event and offering to repurchase the notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a change of control repurchase event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date. The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a change of control repurchase event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes by virtue of compliance with such securities laws or regulations.
     On the repurchase date following a change of control repurchase event, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful:
 
     The paying agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered.
     The Issuer shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control repurchase event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of Holders, the following definitions are applicable:
     "change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act) or group of related "persons" other than the Issuer or its subsidiaries; (2) the adoption of a plan relating to the Issuer's liquidation or dissolution; (3) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as defined above) or group of related "persons" becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Issuer's stock or other voting stock into which the Issuer's voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Issuer are not continuing directors.
     "change of control repurchase event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings event.
     "continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of the Issuer who (1) was a member of such board of directors on the date of the issuance of the Notes; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.
     "investment grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Issuer.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc. and its successors.
     "rating agency" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons
 
outside of the control of the Issuer, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act, selected by the Issuer (as certified by a resolution of the board of directors of the Issuer) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.
     "rating category" means (i) with respect to S&P, any of the following categories: BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C and D (or equivalent successor categories); (ii) with respect to Moody's, any of the following categories: Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C and D (or equivalent successor categories); and (iii) the equivalent of any such category of S&P or Moody's used by another rating agency. In determining whether the rating of the Notes has decreased by one or more gradations, gradations within rating categories (+ and  for S&P; 1, 2 and 3 for Moody's; or the equivalent gradations for another Rating Agency) shall be taken into account (e.g., with respect to S&P, a decline in a rating from BB+ to BB, as well as from BB- to B+, will constitute a decrease of one gradation).
     "rating date" means the date which is 90 days prior to the earlier of (i) a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or of the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control.
     "ratings event" means the occurrence of the events described in (a) or (b) below on, or within 60 days after the earlier of, (i) the occurrence of a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies): (a) in the event the Notes are rated by both rating agencies on the rating date as investment grade, the rating of the Notes shall be reduced so that the Notes are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies, or (b) in the event the Notes (1) are rated investment grade by one rating agency and below investment grade by the other rating agency, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories) so that the Notes are then rated below investment grade by both rating agencies or (2) are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies on the rating date, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a ratings event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus shall not be deemed a ratings event for purposes of the definition of change of control repurchase event hereunder) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
     "voting stock" of any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
Events of Default
     In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture.
Amendments
     The Senior Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series issued under such Senior Indenture then Outstanding and affected, voting as one class, to add any provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of, such Senior Indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series so affected; provided that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, (i) extend the stated maturity of the principal of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or change the currency in which the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), premium, if any, or interest thereon is payable or reduce the amount of any original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in bankruptcy or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any Security when due or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of Securities of any series issued under such Senior Indenture, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such modification. It is also provided in the Senior Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Senior Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
Payment
     No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional,
 
to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
Transfer, Registration and Exchange
     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the Issuer may from time to time designate, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and in multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the issuer may from time to time designate, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge, Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations.
     The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration of the issue hereof.
     The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
     This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
     Terms used herein which are defined in the Senior Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Senior Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after May 1 or November 1 as the case may be, and before the following May 15 or November 15, this Note shall bear interest from such May 15 or November 15; provided, that if the Issuer shall default in the payment of interest due on such May 15 or November 15, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding May 15 or November 15, to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes or duly provided for, from November 1, 2007. The interest so payable on any May 15 or November 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Senior Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such May 15 or November 15. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to a Senior Indenture dated as of May 1, 1995 (herein called the "Senior Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Senior Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any) and may otherwise vary as provided in the Senior Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as the 6.000% Senior Notes due November 15, 2017 (the "Notes") of the Issuer. The Notes are initially limited in aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000; provided, however, that the Issuer may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional notes ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise similar in all respects so that such further notes would be consolidated and form a single series of the Notes.
     Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, this Note will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Note will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, and ownership of this Note shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
Optional Redemption
     The Notes shall be redeemable at the option of the Issuer, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (each a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the Redemption Date, or (ii) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 0.30% (30 basis points). The redemption price shall be calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to the relevant Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record date according to their terms and the provisions of the Senior Indenture.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the
 
remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, or their respective successors, as may be appointed from time to time by the Issuer; provided, however, that if the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and each of their respective successors (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Issuer.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon shall be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, the Issuer shall assume a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
 
     Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on the notes, or portions thereof, called for redemption. On or before the Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
Change of Control
     If a change of control repurchase event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above, the Issuer shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any change of control repurchase event or, at the option of the Issuer, prior to any change of control, but after the public announcement of the change of control, the Issuer shall mail a notice to each holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the change of control repurchase event and offering to repurchase the notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a change of control repurchase event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date. The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a change of control repurchase event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes by virtue of compliance with such securities laws or regulations.
     On the repurchase date following a change of control repurchase event, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful:
 
     The paying agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered.
     The Issuer shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control repurchase event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of Holders, the following definitions are applicable:
     "change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act) or group of related "persons" other than the Issuer or its subsidiaries; (2) the adoption of a plan relating to the Issuer's liquidation or dissolution; (3) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as defined above) or group of related "persons" becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Issuer's stock or other voting stock into which the Issuer's voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Issuer are not continuing directors.
     "change of control repurchase event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings event.
     "continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of the Issuer who (1) was a member of such board of directors on the date of the issuance of the Notes; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.
     "investment grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Issuer.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc. and its successors.
     "rating agency" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons
 
outside of the control of the Issuer, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act, selected by the Issuer (as certified by a resolution of the board of directors of the Issuer) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.
     "rating category" means (i) with respect to S&P, any of the following categories: BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C and D (or equivalent successor categories); (ii) with respect to Moody's, any of the following categories: Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C and D (or equivalent successor categories); and (iii) the equivalent of any such category of S&P or Moody's used by another rating agency. In determining whether the rating of the Notes has decreased by one or more gradations, gradations within rating categories (+ and  for S&P; 1, 2 and 3 for Moody's; or the equivalent gradations for another Rating Agency) shall be taken into account (e.g., with respect to S&P, a decline in a rating from BB+ to BB, as well as from BB- to B+, will constitute a decrease of one gradation).
     "rating date" means the date which is 90 days prior to the earlier of (i) a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or of the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control.
     "ratings event" means the occurrence of the events described in (a) or (b) below on, or within 60 days after the earlier of, (i) the occurrence of a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies): (a) in the event the Notes are rated by both rating agencies on the rating date as investment grade, the rating of the Notes shall be reduced so that the Notes are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies, or (b) in the event the Notes (1) are rated investment grade by one rating agency and below investment grade by the other rating agency, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories) so that the Notes are then rated below investment grade by both rating agencies or (2) are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies on the rating date, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a ratings event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus shall not be deemed a ratings event for purposes of the definition of change of control repurchase event hereunder) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
     "voting stock" of any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
Events of Default
     In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture.
Amendments
     The Senior Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series issued under such Senior Indenture then Outstanding and affected, voting as one class, to add any provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of, such Senior Indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series so affected; provided that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, (i) extend the stated maturity of the principal of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or change the currency in which the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), premium, if any, or interest thereon is payable or reduce the amount of any original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in bankruptcy or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any Security when due or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of Securities of any series issued under such Senior Indenture, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such modification. It is also provided in the Senior Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Senior Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
Payment
     No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
 
Transfer, Registration and Exchange
     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the Issuer may from time to time designate, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration of the issue hereof.

     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon shall be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, the Issuer shall assume a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
 
     Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on the notes, or portions thereof, called for redemption. On or before the Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
Change of Control
     If a change of control repurchase event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above, the Issuer shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any change of control repurchase event or, at the option of the Issuer, prior to any change of control, but after the public announcement of the change of control, the Issuer shall mail a notice to each holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the change of control repurchase event and offering to repurchase the notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a change of control repurchase event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date. The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a change of control repurchase event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes by virtue of compliance with such securities laws or regulations.
     On the repurchase date following a change of control repurchase event, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful:
 
     The paying agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered.
     The Issuer shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control repurchase event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of Holders, the following definitions are applicable:
     "change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act) or group of related "persons" other than the Issuer or its subsidiaries; (2) the adoption of a plan relating to the Issuer's liquidation or dissolution; (3) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as defined above) or group of related "persons" becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Issuer's stock or other voting stock into which the Issuer's voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Issuer are not continuing directors.
     "change of control repurchase event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings event.
     "continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of the Issuer who (1) was a member of such board of directors on the date of the issuance of the Notes; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.
     "investment grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Issuer.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc. and its successors.
     "rating agency" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons
 
outside of the control of the Issuer, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act, selected by the Issuer (as certified by a resolution of the board of directors of the Issuer) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.
     "rating category" means (i) with respect to S&P, any of the following categories: BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C and D (or equivalent successor categories); (ii) with respect to Moody's, any of the following categories: Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C and D (or equivalent successor categories); and (iii) the equivalent of any such category of S&P or Moody's used by another rating agency. In determining whether the rating of the Notes has decreased by one or more gradations, gradations within rating categories (+ and  for S&P; 1, 2 and 3 for Moody's; or the equivalent gradations for another Rating Agency) shall be taken into account (e.g., with respect to S&P, a decline in a rating from BB+ to BB, as well as from BB- to B+, will constitute a decrease of one gradation).
     "rating date" means the date which is 90 days prior to the earlier of (i) a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or of the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control.
     "ratings event" means the occurrence of the events described in (a) or (b) below on, or within 60 days after the earlier of, (i) the occurrence of a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies): (a) in the event the Notes are rated by both rating agencies on the rating date as investment grade, the rating of the Notes shall be reduced so that the Notes are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies, or (b) in the event the Notes (1) are rated investment grade by one rating agency and below investment grade by the other rating agency, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories) so that the Notes are then rated below investment grade by both rating agencies or (2) are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies on the rating date, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a ratings event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus shall not be deemed a ratings event for purposes of the definition of change of control repurchase event hereunder) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
     "voting stock" of any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
Events of Default
     In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture.
Amendments
     The Senior Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series issued under such Senior Indenture then Outstanding and affected, voting as one class, to add any provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of, such Senior Indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series so affected; provided that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, (i) extend the stated maturity of the principal of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or change the currency in which the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), premium, if any, or interest thereon is payable or reduce the amount of any original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in bankruptcy or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any Security when due or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of Securities of any series issued under such Senior Indenture, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such modification. It is also provided in the Senior Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Senior Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
Payment
     No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional,
 
to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
Transfer, Registration and Exchange
     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the Issuer may from time to time designate, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and in multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the issuer may from time to time designate, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge, Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations.
     The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration of the issue hereof.
     The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
     This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
     Terms used herein which are defined in the Senior Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Senior Indenture.
