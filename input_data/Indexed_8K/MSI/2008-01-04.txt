During the first half of 2007, Motorola, Inc. (the "Company") announced cost-reduction initiatives, including planned workforce reductions, aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. In connection with these initiatives, during the first nine months of 2007, the Company took charges of $311 million representing severance costs for approximately 5,100 employees.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, in connection with such previously announced workforce reductions, the Company has taken specific actions that will result in severance costs relating to approximately 1,600 additional employees. The result will be a net pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter totaling approximately $90 million, comprised of $90 million in charges for severance costs and $9 million of exit costs for leased facilities associated with the cost-reduction initiatives described above, partially offset by $9 million of reversals for accruals from prior periods that are no longer needed. All of the above estimated charges are expected to result in future cash expenditures during 2008. All three of the Company's business segments, as well as various corporate functions, are impacted by these plans.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
