During the first quarter of 2008, Motorola, Inc. (the "Company") has taken specific actions relating to workforce reductions that will result in severance costs relating to approximately 2,600 employees. The result will be a net pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2008 totaling approximately $104 million, comprised of $113 million in charges for severance costs, partially offset by $9 million of reversals for accruals from prior periods that are no longer needed. All of the above estimated charges are expected to result in future cash expenditures during 2008. All three of the Company's business segments, as well as various corporate functions, are impacted by these plans.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
