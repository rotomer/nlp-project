On August 27, 2008, Motorola, Inc. (the "Company" or "Motorola") entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Gregory Q. Brown ("Executive"), Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chief Executive of Motorola's Broadband Mobility Solutions business ("BMS"). The table below describes key terms of the Employment Agreement. Certain of the terms of the Employment Agreement memorialize previously agreed and disclosed terms and are indicated as such below.
The Company previously established Executive's base salary, annual bonus, 2008 special bonus and long range incentive award in January 2008 and the Employment Agreement memorializes those pre-established terms. The overall compensation package is designed to align Mr. Brown's interests with the interests of Motorola's stockholders. Each of the annual bonus, 2008 special bonus and long range incentive plan is subject to satisfaction of performance goals. In addition, the value of the contract restricted stock units, contract stock options and contract stock appreciation rights awarded under the new employment agreement depends entirely upon the value of Motorola common stock. The contract stock options and contract stock appreciation right (which together represent approximately 66% of the contract awards) will have no spread value (, the difference between the strike price and the fair market value of Motorola common stock) unless the price of Motorola common stock increases following the grant date. The "Post Separation Equity Award" described below would be granted only if and when Motorola's mobile devices business becomes a separate publicly traded company with a minimum market capitalization and will contain an additional vesting hurdle tied to a post-separation increase in the price of Motorola common stock.

          (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order: (i) Section 5(b)(i)(B), (ii) Section 5(b)(i)(C) and Section 5(b)(ii). For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and
Gross-Up Payment
 
no other Payments) shall be reduced. If the reduction of the amount payable under this Agreement would not result in a reduction of the Parachute Value of all Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under the Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 8(a) and the Executive shall be treated hereunder as if the Parachute Value is in excess of 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount. The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 8 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
          (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 8(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 8, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by KPMG LLP, or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the ""), provided that for purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive's marginal blended actual rates of federal, state and local income taxation in the calendar year in which the change in ownership or effective control that subjects the Executive to the Excise Tax occurs shall be used. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (the ""), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. If Section 280G of the Code requires a calculation of the Excise Tax and/or the Gross-Up Payment at more than one point in time, each such calculation shall be made by the Accounting Firm on an aggregate basis and this Section 8, properly adjusted, shall reapply.
Accounting Firm
Underpayment
          (c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim. The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
               (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
 
               (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
               (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
               (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
, , that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that, if the Company pays such claim and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or reimbursement made pursuant to Section 8 shall be paid to the Executive promptly and in no event later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the related tax is paid by the Executive or as otherwise provided under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).

If, after payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid; , , that no offset shall apply to any amounts subject to Section 409A.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding.

Representations
          14. .
Section 409A
          (a) The intent of the Parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A or are exempt therefrom and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. If the Executive notifies the Company (with specificity as to the reason therefor) that the Executive believes that any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section 409A and the Company concurs with such belief or the Company (without any obligation whatsoever to do so) independently makes such determination, the Company shall, after consulting with the Executive, reform such provision in a manner that is economically neutral to the Company to attempt to comply with Section 409A through good faith modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Section 409A.
          (b) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits (including Company equity awards) subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Executive is no longer providing services (at a level that would preclude the occurrence of a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A) to Motorola as an employee or consultant, and for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a "termination," "termination of employment" or like terms shall mean "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A. If the Executive is deemed on the Date of Termination to be a Specified Employee, then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a "separation from service," such payment or benefit shall be made or provided on the Delayed Payment Date.
          (c) With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Section 409A, (i) the right to
 
reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits, provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year, that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Internal Revenue Code Section 105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect and (iii) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of the Executive's taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred.
provided
          (d) Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (, "payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination"), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.
e.g.
          (e) For purposes of Section 409A, the Executive's right to receive any "installment" payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set the Executive's hand and, pursuant to the authorization from its Board of Directors, the Company has caused these presents to be executed in its name and on its behalf, all as of the day and year first above written.

The following Agreement is established to protect the trade secrets, intellectual property, confidential information, customer relationships and goodwill of Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola" or the "Company") and each of its subsidiaries (the "Company") both as defined in the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006 (the "2006 Plan"). Reference is made to the employment agreement ("Employment Agreement") by and between Gregory Q. Brown and Motorola, dated as of the [___] day of [___].
As consideration for the stock option(s) referenced in the [___], 2008 Motorola, Inc. Award Document for the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006  Terms and Conditions Related to Employee Nonqualified Stock Options, Commerce ID # [___] (the "Covered Options"), and Motorola having provided me with Confidential Information (as defined in the Employment Agreement) as Chief Executive Officer of Motorola and Chief Executive Officer of Motorola's Broadband Mobility Solutions Business, I agree to the following:
1. Sections 7(a), (b) and (c) (together, the "Restrictive Covenants") of the Employment Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement and shall apply as if fully set forth herein mutatis mutandis and any capitalized terms used in such Sections 7(a), (b) and (c) shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Employment Agreement. I acknowledge that my agreement to the Restrictive Covenants is a condition of the grant of the Covered Options.
2. I acknowledge that the Covered Options are subject to the terms and conditions of the Company's Policy Regarding Recoupment of Incentive Payments upon Financial Restatement, as such policy is in effect on the grant date set forth above (such policy, as it may be amended from time to time, being the "Recoupment Policy"). The Recoupment Policy provides for determinations by the Company's independent directors that, as a result of intentional misconduct by me, the Company's financial results were restated (a "Policy Restatement"). In the event of a Policy Restatement, the Company's independent directors may require, among other things (a) cancellation of any of the Covered Options that remain outstanding; and/or (b) reimbursement of any gains realized in respect of the Covered Options, if and to the extent the conditions set forth in the Recoupment Policy apply. Any determinations made by the independent directors in accordance with the Recoupment Policy shall be binding upon me. The Recoupment Policy is in addition to any other remedies which may be otherwise available at law, in equity or under contract, to the Company.
3. I agree that by accepting the Covered Options, if I violate the Restrictive Covenants, then, in addition to any other remedies available in law and/or equity in any country, all of my vested and unvested Covered Options will terminate and no longer be exercisable, and for all Covered Options exercised within one year prior to the termination of my employment for any reason or anytime after termination of my employment for any reason, I will immediately pay to the Company the difference between the exercise price on the date
 
of grant as reflected in the Award Document for the Covered Options and the market price of the Covered Options on the date of exercise (the "spread").
4. The Restrictive Covenants can be waived or modified only upon the prior written consent of Motorola.
5. I acknowledge that the promises in this Agreement, not any employment of or services performed by me in the course and scope of that employment, are the sole consideration for the Covered Options. I agree the Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement which shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, subject to the limitations on assignment contained in the Employment Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the assigns and successors of the Company's mobile devices business and that references to Motorola or the Company shall include any such assigns and successors.
6 I acknowledge that the harm caused to the Company by the breach or anticipated breach of the Restrictive Covenants will be irreparable and I agree the Company may obtain injunctive relief against me in addition to and cumulative with any other legal or equitable rights and remedies the Company may have pursuant to this Agreement, any other agreements between me and the Company for the protection of the Company's Confidential Information (as defined in the Employment Agreement), or law, including the recovery of liquidated damages.

1. Sections 7(a), (b) and (c) (together, the "Restrictive Covenants") of the Employment Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement and shall apply as if fully set forth herein mutatis mutandis and any capitalized terms used in such Sections 7(a), (b) and (c) shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Employment Agreement. I acknowledge that my agreement to the Restrictive Covenants is a condition of the grant of the Covered SAR.

The Recoupment Policy provides for determinations by the Company's independent directors that, as a result of intentional misconduct by me, the Company's financial results were restated (a "Policy Restatement"). In the event of a Policy Restatement, the Company's independent directors may require, among other things (a) cancellation of all or part of the Covered SAR that remains outstanding; and/or (b) reimbursement of any gains realized in respect of the Covered SAR, if and to the extent the conditions set forth in the Recoupment Policy apply.

defined in the Award Document) pertaining to the portion of the Covered SAR exercised during such time.
4. The Restrictive Covenants can be waived or modified only upon the prior written consent of Motorola.

I agree the Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement which shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, subject to the limitations on assignment contained in the Employment Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the assigns and successors of the Company's mobile devices business and that references to Motorola or the Company shall include any such assigns and successors.
6 I acknowledge that the harm caused to the Company by the breach or anticipated breach of the Restrictive Covenants will be irreparable and I agree the Company may obtain injunctive relief against me in addition to and cumulative with any other legal or equitable rights and remedies the Company may have pursuant to this Agreement, any other agreements between me and the Company for the protection of the Company's Confidential Information (as defined in the Employment Agreement), or law, including the recovery of liquidated damages. I agree that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, as specified in paragraph 9 below, will, at the request of the Company, be entered on consent and enforced by any such court having jurisdiction over me. This relief would occur without prejudice to any rights either party may have to appeal from the proceedings that resulted in any grant of such relief.
7. With respect to the Covered SAR, this Agreement (and any provisions of the Employment Agreement incorporated into this Agreement) is my entire agreement with the Company. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Company shall be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach or as a modification of such provision.

I also agree that the court may modify any invalid, overbroad or unenforceable term of this Agreement so that such term, as modified, is valid and enforceable under applicable law. Further, I affirmatively state that I have not, will not and cannot rely on any representations not expressly made herein.
