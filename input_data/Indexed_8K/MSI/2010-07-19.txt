On July 16, 2010, Motorola, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Master Acquisition Agreement (the "Acquisition Agreement") with Nokia Siemens Networks B.V., a Dutch company (the "Purchaser").  Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell to the Purchaser certain assets and liabilities of the Company's business of designing, developing, manufacturing, purchasing, selling, integrating, installing and servicing end-to-end cellular networks for public network operators (the "Business").
 
The assets of the Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Group") to be sold to the Purchaser and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Purchaser Group") under the Acquisition Agreement include real and personal property, contract rights, inventory, certain intellectual property, certain accounts receivable and certain other assets that are used in or relate to the Business, all as further specified in the Acquisition Agreement.  As consideration for the purchase of the assets, the Purchaser has agreed to pay $1.2 billion in cash to the Company on the closing date of the transaction.  Certain assets of the Seller Group used in or relating to the Business will be excluded from the transaction and retained by the Seller Group, including $150 million of accounts receivable, cash, certain customer financing notes, the Company's iDEN infrastructure business, substantially all the patents related to the Company's wireless network infrastructure business, and other assets as specified in the Acquisition Agreement.
 
The Purchaser has also agreed to assume liabilities specified in the Acquisition Agreement. The liabilities of the Seller Group to be assumed include accounts payable, contract liabilities, warranty claims, employee-related liabilities and other liabilities of the Seller Group that relate to the acquired assets or the Business and are specified in the Acquisition Agreement.  Certain liabilities of the Seller Group will be retained by the Seller Group as specified in the Acquisition Agreement.  The transaction is subject to a post-closing adjustment based on the amount of Net Assets (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement) on the closing date in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.
 
The Acquisition Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations of the parties thereto as set forth therein.  In addition, the Company agrees that it will not, and will not cause or permit its affiliates to, compete with the Business (subject to certain exceptions) for a period of two years after the closing date, under the terms specified in the Acquisition Agreement.
 
The consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, and the Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the Acquisition Agreement if the closing has not occurred on or before April 30, 2011.

Nokia Siemens Networks and Motorola, Inc. (NYSE: MOT)
today jointly announced that the companies have entered into an agreement under which Nokia Siemens Networks will acquire the majority of Motorola's wireless network infrastructure assets for US $1.2 billion in cash. The companies expect to complete closing activities by the end of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals.
 
"This is an exciting acquisition that I believe has significant benefits for customers, employees and our shareholders," said
Rajeev Suri, Chief Executive Officer of Nokia Siemens Networks. "Motorola's current customers will continue to get world-class support for their installed base and a clear path for transitioning to next generation technologies while employees will join an industry leader with global scale and reach.  Nokia Siemens Networks will see the benefits of a deal that is expected to enhance profitability and cash-flow and to have significant upside potential."
 
"Motorola is very proud of the operational and financial performance of our Networks business and its employees, who will now become a valuable addition to Nokia Siemens Networks. We are excited to have reached this agreement to combine our Networks team with such an industry leader," said Greg Brown, Co-CEO of Motorola. "This is great news for our customers, our investors and our people and will allow us to sharpen our strategic focus on providing mission and business critical solutions for our government, public safety, and enterprise customers."
 
As part of the transaction, Nokia Siemens Networks expects to gain incumbent relationships with more than 50 operators and to strengthen its position with China Mobile, Clearwire, KDDI, Sprint, Verizon Wireless and Vodafone.
 
"We are pleased to be able to add new relationships with some customers, and reinforce our position with others," said Suri.  "I believe the addition of Motorola's Networks business
 
will significantly strengthen our worldwide presence, enhance our scale in the United States, Japan and other priority regions and reinforce our leadership position in the global wireless sector."
 
"Verizon views today's announcement as good news for the global wireless industry," said Richard J. Lynch, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Verizon.  "This deal brings together two important Verizon suppliers; we look forward to our continuing work with Nokia Siemens Networks."
 
Nokia Siemens Networks expects that based on revenue, with the addition of the Motorola wireless network infrastructure business, it will become the #3 wireless infrastructure vendor in the United States, the #1 foreign wireless vendor in Japan, and strengthen its current #2 position in the global infrastructure segment.
 
Motorola's networks infrastructure business provides products and services for wireless networks, including GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, WiMAX and LTE.  This business is a market leader in WiMAX, with 41 contracts in 21 countries; has a strong global footprint in CDMA with 30 active networks in 22 countries; and a robust GSM installed base, with more than 80 active networks in 66 countries; and excellent traction with LTE early adopters.
 
"As customers look to transition from CDMA networks to next generation technologies, the addition of the Motorola wireless network infrastructure business is targeted to ensure that we are well placed to meet those needs," said Bosco Novak, head of Customer Operations at Nokia Siemens Networks. "Together, we will utilize the combined strength of Nokia Siemens Networks' TD-LTE solutions and Motorola's WiMAX and LTE businesses, to better meet customers' evolving technology and business needs."
 
Approximately 7,500 employees are expected to transfer to Nokia Siemens Networks from Motorola's wireless network infrastructure
business when the transaction closes, including large research and development sites in the United States, China and India. 
Motorola retains the iDEN business, substantially all the patents related to its wireless network infrastructure business and other selected assets.
 
The
companies expect to complete closing activities by the end of 2010
and therefore do not expect the transaction to have any impact on Nokia Siemens Networks' financial performance in 2010.
 
Nokia Siemens Networks and Motorola also are exploring a global relationship in the public safety arena. This relationship would combine Motorola's leadership in providing solutions to public safety organizations with Nokia Siemens Networks' commercial LTE solutions.

Nokia Siemens Networks and Motorola will host a conference call for media beginning at 10:30 a.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on Monday, July 19. The conference call will be webcast live with audio at www.motorola.com/investor.
