The Company's 2011 Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan
On January 25, 2011, the Board approved and adopted the Company's 2011 Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan (the ""). The New Senior Officer Plan will be (1) the Company's change in control severance plan for officers of the Company who are at or above the level of Senior Vice President ("") who are first elected or promoted to such positions on or after February 1, 2011 and (2) the Company's replacement change in control severance plan, effective February 1, 2014, for then Senior Officers who are otherwise eligible to participate in one of the pre-existing change in control plans on or before January 31, 2014 and who, as Senior Officers, have a Date of Termination (as defined in the New Senior Officer Plan) on or after February 1, 2014 in connection with a change in control. In particular, under the New Senior Officer Plan:
New Senior Officer Plan
Senior Officers
 
 
 
 
 
 
The New Senior Officer Plan's term is for four years, unless earlier terminated. If a Change in Control occurs during the term, the New Senior Officer Plan continues for at least an additional two years from the Change in Control. The New Senior Officer Plan may not be amended or terminated in a manner adverse to participants except upon one years' advance written notice.
The Company's Legacy Senior Officer Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan
On January 25, 2011, in connection with its approval of the New Senior Officer Plan, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the Motorola, Inc. Senior Officer Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan in the form of the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Legacy Senior Officer Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan (the ""), to reflect the closure of the Legacy Senior Officer Plan to new participants effective February 1, 2011 and/or the anticipated termination of the Legacy Senior Officer Plan as of January 31, 2014 (except to the extent needed to pay severance pay and benefit obligations under the Legacy Senior Officer Plan with respect to participants who terminate employment on or prior to that date). In addition, the Legacy Senior Officer Plan reflects the Company's recent name change from Motorola, Inc. to Motorola Solutions, Inc., clarifies that, if applicable, sales incentive bonuses would be paid to the same extent as annual incentive bonuses, and clarifies that the severance rights of participants who terminate employment on or before January 31, 2014 will be governed by the Legacy Senior Officer Plan rather than the New Senior Officer Plan.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: January 31, 2011
 

Exhibit 10.1
Exhibit A
The Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions, Inc. considers the maintenance of a sound management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company (as hereinafter defined) and its stockholders. In this connection, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) may exist from time to time, and that this possibility, and the uncertainty and questions it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Board (as hereinafter defined) has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their assigned duties without the distraction which may arise from the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company. The Company has further determined that this Plan (as hereinafter defined) will be effective as of February 1, 2011 for officers of the Company at or above the level of Senior Vice President ("Senior Officers") who are first elected or promoted to such positions on or after February 1, 2011, and will be effective as of February 1, 2014 for then Senior Officers who, on or before January 31, 2014, were otherwise eligible to participate in the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Legacy Senior Officer Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan, the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Legacy Corporate Officer Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan, the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Legacy Corporate Officer Transition Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CVP Transition Plan") or who otherwise was a Corporate Vice President before May 9, 2001 and has a change in control agreement of the type referred to in the CVP Transition Plan (except for those whose Date of Termination is on or before January 31, 2014). February 1, 2011 or February 1, 2014, as described in the above sentence, is the "Effective Date".
This Plan does not alter the status of Participants (as hereinafter defined) as at-will employees of the Company. Just as Participants remain free to leave the employ of the Company at any time, so too does the Company retain its right to terminate the employment of Participants without notice, at any time, for any reason. However, the Company believes that, both prior to and at the time a Change in Control is anticipated or occurring, it is necessary to have the continued attention and dedication of Participants to their assigned duties without distraction, and this Plan is intended as an inducement for Participants' willingness to continue to serve as employees of the Company (subject, however, to either party's right to terminate such employment at any time). Therefore, should a Participant still be an employee of the Company at such time, the Company agrees that such Participant shall receive the severance benefits hereinafter set forth in the event the Participant's employment with the Company terminates subsequent to a Change in Control under the circumstances described below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 4.2(d), however, in the event that the Participant is terminated by the Company as provided in Section 4.1(a) or resigns for Good Reason, in each case during the twelve-month period prior to a Change in Control, but subsequent to such time as negotiations or discussions with a third party that ultimately lead to a Change in Control have commenced, then such termination (such a termination of employment, an "Anticipatory Termination") shall be deemed to be a termination that entitles such Participant to the severance benefits hereinafter set forth.
As of February 1, 2011, the Company hereby establishes this Motorola Solutions, Inc. 2011 Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Plan").
As used herein, the following words and phrases shall have the following respective meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

With respect to any Participant: (i) the Participant's conviction of any criminal violation involving dishonesty, fraud or breach of trust; or (ii) the Participant's willful engagement in gross misconduct in the performance of the Participant's duties that materially injures the Company or any Subsidiary. For purposes of this Section 2(c), no act, or failure to act, on the part of the Participant will be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Participant's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon (A) authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or if the Company is not the ultimate parent corporation of its Affiliated entities and is not publicly-traded, the board of directors of the ultimate parent of the Company (the "Applicable Board"), (B) the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company or (C) the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Participant shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Applicable Board (excluding the Participant, if the Participant is a member of the Applicable Board) at a meeting of the Applicable Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Participant and the Participant is given an opportunity, together with counsel for the Participant, to be heard before the Applicable Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Applicable Board, the Participant is guilty of the conduct described in Section 2(c)(i) or 2(c)(ii), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

provided, however
Any portion of the Cash Severance Payment that cannot be paid as a lump sum will be paid at the same time that the portion of the 2011 ESP Severance Allowance that does not provide for Exempt Deferred Compensation under the 2011 ESP would be paid.

provided
however
 
(ii) if the Participant participates in a sales incentive plan pursuant to which he or she is eligible for an incentive award with respect to monthly or quarterly performance periods during the year in which the Qualifying Termination occurs, the Company shall pay the Participant, at the time set forth in the applicable sales incentive plan, an amount equal to the product of (A) the Participant's monthly or quarterly incentive at target for the monthly or quarterly period in which the Date of Termination occurs (which for purposes of this Section 4.2 in no event shall be less than the Participant's target bonus for the performance period in which the Change in Control occurs or, in the event of an Anticipatory Termination, the performance period in which the Date of Termination occurs) and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed in the then current monthly or quarterly performance period through the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is the full number of days in the then current monthly or quarterly performance period (the "SIP Quarterly or Monthly Pro-Rata Bonus"); , , that in the event that the Participant experiences an Anticipatory Termination and the Company has already paid the Participant the Alternate Quarterly or Monthly SIP Award (as defined in the 2011 ESP), the Participant shall not be entitled to SIP Quarterly or Monthly Pro-Rata Bonus hereunder; and
provided
however

provided
however
(c) If the Participant's employment is terminated under circumstances which entitle the Participant to Separation Benefits under this Section 4.2, for two (2) years after the Date of Termination (the "Benefit Continuation Period"), or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue medical and dental benefits and life insurance benefits to the Participant and/or the Participant's family at least equal to those that would have been provided in accordance with the medical and dental benefits and life insurance plans, programs, practices and policies of the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control if the Participant's employment had not been terminated on the same terms and conditions (including any applicable required employee contributions), except that in the event of an Anticipatory Termination and to avoid duplication of benefits, such continued medical benefits to be provided hereunder shall commence on the date of the Change in Control and the Benefit Continuation Period shall be reduced by the number of months, if any, during which the Participant receives such medical benefits under the 2011 ESP; , , that, the medical and dental benefits and life insurance provided during the Benefit Continuation Period shall be provided in such a manner that such benefits (and the costs and premiums thereof) are excluded from the Participant's income for federal income tax purposes and, if the Company reasonably determines that providing continued coverage under one or more of its medical or dental plans or life insurance plans contemplated herein could be taxable to the Participant, the Company shall provide such benefits at the level required hereby through the purchase of individual insurance coverage; , , that, if the Participant becomes reemployed with another employer and becomes eligible to receive medical or dental or life insurance benefits under another employer provided plan, the medical and dental benefits and/or life insurance benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Participant for retiree medical benefits pursuant to plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company, the Participant shall be considered to have remained employed until two (2) years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period (and to have attained two (2) additional years of age), and such benefits (and the terms and conditions of such benefits) shall be no less favorable than as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. Following the end of the period during which medical and dental benefits are provided to the Participant under this Section 4.2(c), the Participant shall be eligible for continued medical and dental coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable law, as if the Participant's employment with the Company had terminated as of the end of such period.

(d) Except as provided in Sections 4.2(a) and 4.2(b) (with respect to Anticipatory Terminations) and Section 4.2(c), the Participant shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4.2 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Section 4.2 be reduced by any compensation earned by the Participant as the result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits paid by the Company after the Date of Termination, or otherwise, or by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, or other claim, right or action the Company may have against the Participant or others.
(e) Without affecting a Participant's eligibility to receive benefits under Section 4.2(a), (b), or (c) in the event of an Anticipatory Termination, the provisions of this Article IV shall be applicable after a Change in Control has occurred, but not prior thereto.
4.3 . Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder or under any other plan, agreement or arrangement would be an "Excess Parachute Payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; , , that the foregoing reduction shall be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). The effect of the preceding sentence is that a Participant shall be entitled to receive the greater of (a) the after-tax benefit if the aggregate payments and benefits are received without reduction and the Participant pays all taxes, including any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, and (b) the after-tax benefit if the aggregate payments and benefits are reduced so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment. All determinations required to be made under this Section 4.3 shall be made by an independent accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm"), which Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the applicable Participant within fifteen (15) business days of the Date of Termination or such earlier time as is requested by the Company and, if requested by the applicable Participant, an opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any excise tax on his Federal income tax return with respect to the Excess Parachute Payments. Any such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the applicable Participant. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company; , , (i) the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the related work is performed or the expenses are incurred by the Accounting Firm, (ii) the amount of the Accounting Fees that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the Accounting Fees that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and (iii) the Participant's right to have the Company pay such fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. The fact that a Participant's right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 4.3 shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of the Participant under this Plan. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.3, then the reduction shall occur in the following order: (iv) Section 4.2(a)(v), (v) Section 4.2(a)(iv), (vi) Section 4.2(b)(i), (vii) Section 4.2(b)(ii), (viii) Section 4.2(b)(iii), and (ix) Section 4.2(c).
Adjustment of Payments by the Company
provided

provided
however
Each Participant shall be responsble for all taxes imposed on the Participant on account of payments and benefits received under this Plan, including without limitation any excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.
 
This Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Plan if no succession had taken place. In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.

Governing Law
 

Exhibit 10.2
Exhibit B
The Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions, Inc. considers the maintenance of a sound management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company (as hereinafter defined) and its stockholders. In this connection, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) may exist from time to time, and that this possibility, and the uncertainty and questions it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Board (as hereinafter defined) has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their assigned duties without the distraction which may arise from the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company. The Company has further determined to amend and restate the Legacy Senior Officer Plan to exclude from participation officers of the Company at or above the level of Senior Vice President ("Senior Officers") who are first elected or promoted to such positions on or after February 1, 2011 and to reflect the anticipated termination of this Legacy Senior Officer Plan effective January 31, 2014, except as set forth in Sections 3.2 and 6.1 hereof.
This Legacy Senior Officer Plan does not alter the status of Participants (as hereinafter defined) as at-will employees of the Company. Just as Participants remain free to leave the employ of the Company at any time, so too does the Company retain its right to terminate the employment of Participants without notice, at any time, for any reason. However, the Company believes that, both prior to and at the time a Change in Control is anticipated or occurring, it is necessary to have the continued attention and dedication of Participants to their assigned duties without distraction, and this Legacy Senior Officer Plan is intended as an inducement for Participants' willingness to continue to serve as employees of the Company (subject, however, to either party's right to terminate such employment at any time). Therefore, should a Participant still be an employee of the Company at such time, the Company agrees that such Participant shall receive the severance benefits hereinafter set forth in the event the Participant's employment with the Company terminates subsequent to a Change in Control under the circumstances described below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 4.2(d), however, in the event that the Participant is terminated by the Company as provided in Section 4.1(a) or resigns for Good Reason, in each case during the twelve-month period prior to a Change in Control, but subsequent to such time as negotiations or discussions with a third party which ultimately lead to a Change in Control have commenced, then such termination (such a termination of employment, an "Anticipatory Termination") shall be deemed to be a termination which entitles such Participant to the severance benefits hereinafter set forth.
As of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined), the Company hereby amends and restates the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Legacy Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan, as set forth in this document.
As used herein the following words and phrases shall have the following respective meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

For purposes of this Section 2(c), no act, or failure to act, on the part of the Participant shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Participant's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon (A) authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or if the Company is not the ultimate parent corporation of its Affiliated entities and is not publicly-traded, the board of directors of the ultimate parent of the Company (the "Applicable Board"), (B) the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company or (C) the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Participant shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Applicable Board (excluding the Participant, if the Participant is a member of the Applicable Board) at a meeting of the Applicable Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Participant and the Participant is given an opportunity, together with counsel for the Participant, to be heard before the Applicable Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Applicable Board, the Participant is guilty of the conduct described in Section 2(c)(i) or 2(c)(ii), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Participant for retiree medical benefits pursuant to plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company, the Participant shall be considered to have remained employed until three (3) years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period (and to have attained three (3) additional years of age), and such benefits (and the terms and conditions of such benefits) shall be no less favorable than as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. Following the end of the period during which medical and dental benefits are provided to the Participant under this Section 4.2(b), the Participant shall be eligible for continued medical and dental coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable law, as if the Participant's employment with the Company had terminated as of the end of such period.

(d) Without affecting a Participant's eligibility to receive benefits under Section 4.2(a) or (b) in the event of an Anticipatory Termination, the provisions of this Article IV shall be applicable after a Change in Control has occurred, but not prior thereto.
 
4.3 .
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
(a) Anything in this Legacy Senior Officer Plan to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment (as hereinafter defined) would be subject to the Excise Tax (as hereinafter defined), then the Participant shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Participant of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto), employment taxes and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A, the Participant retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.3(a), if it shall be determined that the Participant is entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value (as hereinafter defined) of all Payments do not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount (as hereinafter defined), then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Participant and the amounts payable under this Legacy Senior Officer Plan shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order: (i) Section 4.2(a)(v), (ii) Section 4.2(a)(iv) and (iii) Section 4.2(b). For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Legacy Senior Officer Plan (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. If the reduction of the amount payable under this Legacy Senior Officer Plan would not result in a reduction of the Parachute Value of all Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under the Legacy Senior Officer Plan shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.3(a). The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 4.3(a) shall not be conditioned upon the Participant's termination of employment.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 4.3, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm as may be selected by the Company prior to a Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Participant that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company; (i) the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the related work is performed or the expenses are incurred by the Accounting Firm, (ii) the amount of the Accounting Fees that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the Accounting Fees that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and (iii) the Participant's right to have the Company pay such fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (the "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 4.3(c) and the Participant thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant.
provided, however,
(c) The Participant shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than ten (10) business days after the Participant is informed in writing of such claim. The Participant shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Participant gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Participant in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Participant shall:
(1) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
 
(2) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
(3) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(4) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses; , (i) the Company shall pay the costs and expenses not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the costs and expenses are incurred, (ii) the amount of such costs and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the costs and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and (iii) the Participant's right to have the Company pay such costs and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.3(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Participant and direct the Participant to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Participant agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one (1) or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that, if the Company pays such claim and directs the Participant to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the Participant's taxable year with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

(d) If, after the receipt by the Participant of a Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Company of an amount on the Participant's behalf pursuant to Section 4.3(c), the Participant becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Participant shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 4.3(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after payment by the Company of an amount on the Participant's behalf pursuant to Section 4.3(c), a determination is made that the Participant shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Participant in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
(e) Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 4.3, shall be paid by the Company to the Participant within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination; that, the Gross-Up Payment shall in all events be paid no later than the end of the Participant's taxable year next following the Participant's taxable year in which the Excise Tax (and any income or other related taxes or interest or penalties thereon) on a Payment are remitted to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority or, in the case of amounts relating to a claim described in Section 4.3(c) that does not result in the remittance of any federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, social security and other taxes, the calendar year in which the claim is finally settled or otherwise resolved.
provided
 
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.3, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Participant, all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment, and the Participant hereby consents to such withholding; , that, such withholding and payment shall in no event place the Participant in a less favorable tax position than had such payments been made to the Participant by the Company.
provided

(iii) "Parachute Value" of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2), as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
(iv) A "Payment" shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Participant, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Legacy Senior Officer Plan or otherwise.

This Legacy Senior Officer Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Legacy Senior Officer Plan if no succession had taken place. In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Legacy Senior Officer Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Legacy Senior Officer Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. The term "Company," as used in this Legacy Senior Officer Plan, shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor or assignee to the business or assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by this Legacy Senior Officer Plan.
6.1 . This Legacy Senior Officer Plan shall expire on January 31, 2014.
