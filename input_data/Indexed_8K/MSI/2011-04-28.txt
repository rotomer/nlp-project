 April 28, 2011  (NYSE: MSI) announced today its first-quarter 2011 results highlighted by sales of $1.9 billion, up 8 percent from the first quarter of 2010 and driven by solid demand across both its Government and Enterprise segments.
SCHAUMBURG, Ill.
Motorola Solutions, Inc.
"Motorola Solutions had an outstanding first quarter with revenue growth in all four of our geographic regions," said Greg Brown, president and CEO, Motorola Solutions. "We maintained our focus on solid earnings and cash generation as our government and enterprise customers continued to seek solutions that drive improved efficiency and strong return on investment."
GAAP operating earnings in the first quarter of 2011 were $170 million or 9 percent of sales, compared to $120 million or 7 percent of sales in the first quarter of 2010. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.06, compared to $0.29 in the first quarter of 2010.
Non-GAAP operating earnings in the first quarter of 2011 were $267 million or 14 percent of sales, compared to $175 million or 10 percent of sales in the first quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.54, compared to $0.33 in the first quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP financial information excludes after-tax benefits of approximately $0.52 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization expense and highlighted items. Details on these Non-GAAP adjustments and the use of Non-GAAP measures are included later in this press release.
During the first quarter of 2011, the company generated $231 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations and $191 million in operating cash flow from discontinued operations. We ended the quarter with total cash of $6.2 billion and net cash**** of $3.5 billion.

Networks Financial Results
First-quarter net earnings from discontinued operations were $132 million. Discontinued operations substantially relate to the portion of the company's Networks business expected to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks on April 29, 2011.
Second-Quarter 2011 Outlook
The company expects to see growth across both government and enterprise segments. Second-quarter sales are expected to grow between 4 and 5 percent over the second quarter of 2010 with EPS from continuing operations of $0.46 to $0.51. This outlook excludes the portion of the Networks business expected to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks as well as stock-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization expense and charges associated with items of the variety typically highlighted by the company in its quarterly earnings releases. The company now expects full-year revenue growth to track toward 4 to 4.5 percent with operating earnings of 16 to 16.5 percent of sales.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results. We have provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand our core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to our competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items (and any reversals of highlighted items recorded in prior periods) from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.
Highlighted items:
The company has excluded stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding stock-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Stock-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.
Stock-based compensation expense:
The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements, primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company's acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company's revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company's future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.
Intangible assets amortization expense:
Details of the above items and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.
