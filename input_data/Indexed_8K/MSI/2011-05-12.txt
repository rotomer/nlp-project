Exhibit 99.1
Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, subsequent to the distribution by Motorola Solutions, Inc. (the "Company" or "Motorola Solutions") of all the Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. ("Motorola Mobility"), and the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the Company's business of designing, developing, manufacturing, purchasing, selling, integrating, installing and servicing end-to-end cellular networks for public network operators (the "Networks business"). This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing under "Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Executive Overview
What businesses are we in?
Motorola Solutions reports financial results for the following two segments:
 
 
What were our 2010 financial results?
 
 
 
 
 
What were the financial results for our two segments in 2010?
 
 
What were our major challenges and accomplishments in 2010?
 
During the year, the segment was able to overcome worldwide supply shortages and increased lead times to meet demand for our products. Despite the budget challenges facing many of the U.S. governmental customers, demand for our products and solutions by customers in the government and public safety market increased as compared to 2009. In 2010, the segment's continued commitment to quality, enhancements to our comprehensive portfolio, and a strong customer base contributed to higher sales to our U.S. governmental customers.
As a result of our continued strong commitment to R&D, the year brought many new enhancements to our product portfolio. We expanded our APX family of products with additional mobile and portable radios, including radios designed for extreme
 
situations and single-band users and the first encrypted mission-critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when paired with our APX portable radios. We also introduced the industry's first TETRA wideband data capable mobile radio and the world's smallest single unit data capable base station, offering a cost-effective solution for expanding coverage. We were awarded the first phase of a 700 MHz LTE network for public safety across multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay area. This agreement represents a first step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art private mission-critical broadband multimedia network.
 
Our R&D investments resulted in many new enhancements to our product portfolio. We expanded our mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The segment introduced the smallest and lightest enterprise mobile computing device in our mobile computing platform, the ES400. The ES400 features a customizable user interface, integrated voice and data capabilities, as well as mobile computing and scanning functionality.
Recent Developments
On July 19, 2010, the Company announced an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities of the Networks business to Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. ("NSN") (the "Transaction"). On April 13, 2011, the Company announced that it and NSN amended this agreement to, among other things, reduce the cash portion of the purchase price from $1.2 billion to $975 million. On April 29, 2011, the Company completed the Transaction, as amended. Based on the terms and conditions of the amended sale agreement, certain assets including $150 million of accounts receivable are excluded from the Transaction. A significant amount of the cash proceeds were received in the U.S. We expect the cash proceeds, including the $150 million of accounts receivable to be collected after the closing of the Transaction, to be approximately $1.0 billion, net of taxes, assignment fees and other transaction-related fees and expenses. The results of operations of the portions of the Networks business included in the Transaction are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
On January 4, 2011, the distribution by the Company of all the common stock of Motorola Mobility was completed (the "Distribution"). The stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2010 received one (1) share of Motorola Mobility common stock for each eight (8) shares of the Company's common stock held as of the record date. Immediately following the Distribution, the Company changed its name to Motorola Solutions, Inc. The Distribution was structured to be tax-free to Motorola Solutions and its stockholders for U.S. tax purposes (other than with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares). The historical financial results of Motorola Mobility are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Geographic Market Sales by Locale of End Customer
 
 
Results of Operations2010 Compared to 2009
Net Sales
Net sales were $7.9 billion in 2010, a 10% increase compared to net sales of $7.2 billion in 2009. The increase in net sales reflects: (i) a $259 million, or 5%, increase in net sales in the Government segment, and (ii) a $432 million, or 19%, increase in net sales in the Enterprise segment.
Gross Margin
Gross margin was $3.9 billion, or 49.8% of net sales in 2010, compared to $3.6 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, in 2009. Gross margin dollars increased in both segments. The increase in gross margin reflects higher gross margins in both segments, primarily driven by the increase in net sales and product mix. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2010 compared 2009 reflects a slightly higher gross margin percentage in the Government segment and a lower gross margin percentage in the Enterprise segment. The Company's overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales is impacted by the proportion of overall net sales generated by its various businesses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 12% to $1.9 billion, or 24.3% of net sales, in 2010, compared to $1.7 billion, or 23.7% of net sales, in 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses reflects higher SG&A expenses in both segments, primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses related to the increase in net sales and increased employee benefit-related expenses. The increases in employee benefit-related expenses are primarily due to an increase in pension-related expenses and the reinstatement of the Company's 401(k) matching contributions. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the Government segment and decreased in the Enterprise segment.
Research and Development Expenditures
Research and development ("R&D") expenditures increased 4% to $1.1 billion, or 13.7% of net sales, in 2010, compared to $1.0 billion, or 14.5% of net sales, in 2009. The increase in R&D expenditures reflects increased R&D expenditures in both segments, primarily due to developmental engineering expenditures for new product development and investment in next-generation technologies, and increased employee benefit-related expenses, primarily due to an increase of expenses related to awards under current incentive plans.
R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales decreased in both segment. The Company participates in competitive industries with constant changes in technology and, accordingly, the Company continues to believe that a strong commitment to R&D is required to drive long-term growth.
Other Charges
The Company recorded net charges of $150 million in Other charges in 2010, compared to net charges of $255 million in 2009. The charges in 2010 included: (i) $203 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, and (ii) $54 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other charges, partially offset by: (i) $78 million of gains related to intellectual property settlements and reserve adjustments, and (ii) $29 million of income related to a legal settlement. The charges in 2009 included: (i) $218 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, (ii) $88 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other charges, and (iii) $24 million of charges related to an environmental reserve, partially offset by $75 million of income related to a legal settlement. The net reorganization of business charges are discussed in further detail in the "Reorganization of Businesses" section.
Net Interest Income (Expense)
Net interest expense was $129 million in 2010, compared to net interest expense of $133 million in 2009. Net interest expense in 2010 included interest expense of $217 million, partially offset by interest income of $88 million. Net interest expense in 2009 includes interest expense of $207 million, partially offset by interest income of $74 million. The increase in net interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to the absence of reversals of interest expense accruals that were no longer needed as a result of the settlement of certain tax audits during 2009, partially offset by increased interest income from long-term receivables.
Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses
Gains on sales of investments and businesses were $49 million in 2010, compared to a gain of $108 million in 2009. In 2010, the net gain was primarily comprised of a $31 million gain on the sale of a single investment. In 2009, the net gain primarily relates to sales of certain of the Company's equity investments, of which $32 million of gain was attributed to a single investment.
 
Other
Net Other expense was $7 million in 2010, compared to net Other income of $92 million in 2009. The net Other expense in 2010 was primarily comprised of: (i) $21 million of investment impairments, (ii) a $12 million loss from the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt, partially offset by: (i) a $12 million foreign currency gain, and (iii) an $11 million gain from Sigma Fund investments. The net income in 2009 was primarily comprised of: (i) $80 million of gains from Sigma Fund investments, (ii) a $67 million gain related to the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt, and (ii) a $14 million foreign currency gain, partially offset by $75 million of other-than-temporary investment impairment charges.
Effective Tax Rate
The Company recorded $415 million of net tax expense in 2010, resulting in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 60%, compared to $191 million of net tax benefits in 2009, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30%. The Company's effective tax rate in 2010 was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to: (i) an increase in the U.S. federal income tax accrual for repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings related to the realignment of the Company's investment structure in preparation of the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, and (ii) a non-cash tax charge related to the Medicare Part D subsidy tax law change, partially offset by reductions in unrecognized tax benefits for facts that now indicate the extent to which certain tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained.
The Company's effective tax rate will change from period to period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in valuation allowances and the tax impact of significant unusual or extraordinary items, as well as recurring factors including changes in the geographic mix of income and effects of various global income tax strategies.
Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations
The Company had net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $691 million in 2010, compared with $637 million in 2009. After taxes, and excluding Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, the Company had net earnings from continuing operations of $259 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in 2010, compared to $423 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, in 2009.
The improvement in the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a $348 million increase in gross margin and a $105 million decrease in Other charges. These improvements were partially offset by: (i) a $207 million increase in SG&A expenses, (ii) a $99 million decrease in net Other income, as presented in Other income (expense), and (iii) a $59 million decrease in gains on the sale of investments and businesses.
Earnings (loss) from Discontinued Operations
After taxes, the Company had earnings from discontinued operations of $374 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in 2010, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $474 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, in 2009. The improvement in earnings from discontinued operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in the loss from the operations of Motorola Mobility and increase in earnings from the Networks business.
Results of Operations2009 Compared to 2008
Net Sales
Net sales were $7.2 billion in 2009, down 12% compared to net sales of $8.1 billion in 2008. The decrease in net sales reflects: (i) a $577 million, or 20%, decrease in net sales in the Enterprise segment, (ii) a $383 million, or 7%, decrease in net sales in the Government segment.
Gross Margin
Gross margin was $3.6 billion, or 49.7% of net sales, in 2009, compared to $4.1 billion, or 50.2% of net sales, in 2008. Gross margin decreased in both segments, primarily driven by the 12% decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily driven by decrease in gross margin percentage in the Government segment, partially offset by an increase in gross margin percentage in the Enterprise segment. The Company's overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be impacted by the proportion of overall net sales generated by its various businesses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses decreased 8% to $1.7 billion, or 23.7% of net sales, in 2009, compared to $1.8 billion, or 22.6% of net sales, in 2008. SG&A expenses decreased in both segments, primarily due to: (i) savings from cost-reduction initiatives, and (ii) decreased employee benefit-related expenses, reflecting the temporary suspension of the Company's 401(k) matching contributions. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the Enterprise segment and decreased in the Government segment.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
Research and development ("R&D") expenditures decreased 6% to $1.0 billion, or 14.5% of net sales, in 2009, compared to $1.1 billion, or 13.6% of net sales, in 2008. R&D expenditures decreased in both segments, primarily due to savings from cost-reduction initiatives and decreased employee benefit-related expenses. R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales increased in both segments. The Company participates in competitive industries with constant changes in technology and, accordingly, the Company continues to believe that a strong commitment to R&D is required to drive long-term growth.
Other Charges
The Company recorded net charges of $255 million in Other charges in 2009, compared to net charges of $1.8 billion in 2008. The charges in 2009 included: (i) $218 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangibles, (ii) $88 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other charges, and (iii) $24 million of charges related to an environmental reserve, partially offset by $75 million of income related to a legal settlement. The net charges in 2008 included: (i) $1.6 billion of asset impairment charges, (ii) $227 million of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, and (iii) $60 million of net reorganization of business charges included in Other charges, partially offset by a $48 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment. The net reorganization of business charges are discussed in further detail in the "Reorganization of Businesses" section.
Net Interest Income (Expense)
Net interest expense was $133 million in 2009, compared to net interest income of $35 million in 2008. Net interest expense in 2009 includes interest expense of $207 million, partially offset by interest income of $74 million. Net interest income in 2008 included interest income of $245 million, partially offset by interest expense of $210 million. The significant decline in interest income reflects: (i) the significant decrease in average short-term interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008, (ii) a change in the investment mix of the Sigma Fund to more liquid securities with shorter maturities and lower interest rates, and (iii) the decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and Sigma Fund balances in 2009 compared to 2008. This decline in interest income was slightly offset by a decrease in interest expense, primarily driven by a decrease in the Company's level of outstanding debt during 2009.
Gains on Sales of Investments and Businesses
Gains on sales of investments and businesses were $108 million in 2009, compared to gains of $64 million in 2008. In 2009, the net gain primarily relates to sales of certain of the Company's equity investments, of which $32 million of gain was attributed to a single investment. These gains were partially offset by a net loss from the sale of specific businesses. In 2008, the net gain primarily related to sales of a number of the Company's equity investments.
Other
Net Other income was $92 million in 2009, compared to net Other expense of $417 million in 2008. The net income in 2009 was primarily comprised of: (i) $80 million of gains from Sigma Fund investments, (ii) a $67 million gain related to the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt, and (ii) a $14 million foreign currency gain, partially offset by $75 million of other-than-temporary investment impairment charges. The net charges in 2008 were primarily comprised of: (i) $333 million of investment impairment charges, of which $138 million related to a single strategic investment, (ii) $287 million of total losses on Sigma Fund investments, and (iii) $69 million of foreign currency losses, partially offset by: (i) a $237 million curtailment gain associated with the decision to freeze benefit accruals for U.S. pension plans, (ii) $24 million of gains relating to several interest rate swaps not designated as hedges, and (iv) a $14 million gain related to the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt.
Effective Tax Rate
The Company recorded $191 million of net tax expense in 2009, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30%, compared to $2.5 billion of net tax expense, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 249% in 2008. The Company's effective tax rate for 2009 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to a reduction in valuation allowances relating to refundable general business credits and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits for facts that now indicate the extent to which certain tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. The Company's 2008 effective tax rate was negative, primarily due to the recording of a $2.1 billion non-cash tax charge to establish deferred tax valuation allowances against a portion of the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets and the recording of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges.
The Company's effective tax rate will change from period to period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in valuation allowances and the tax impact of significant unusual or extraordinary items, as well as recurring factors including changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes and effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
Earnings (loss) from Continuing Operations
The Company had net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $637 million in 2009, compared with a net loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $997 million in 2008. After taxes, and excluding Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, the Company had earnings from continuing operations of $423 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, in 2009, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $3.5 billion, or $10.76 per diluted share, in 2008.
The improvement in the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributed to: (i) a $1.6 billion decrease in Other charges, (ii) a $509 million increase in income classified as Other, as presented in Other income (expense), and (iii) a $142 million decrease in SG&A expenses. These factors were partially offset by: (i) a $520 million decrease in gross margin, and (ii) a $168 million increase in net interest expense.
Earnings (loss) from Discontinued Operations
After taxes, the Company incurred a loss from discontinued operations of $474 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, in 2009, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $762 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, in 2008. The improvement in the loss from discontinued operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the loss from the operations of Motorola Mobility, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from the Networks business.
Segment Information
The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each segment as detailed in Note 12, "Information by Segment and Geographic Region," to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Net sales and operating results for the Company's two segments for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented below.
Government Segment
In 2010, the segment's net sales represented 65% of the Company's consolidated net sales, compared to 68% in 2009 and 65% in 2008.
 
Segment Results2010 Compared to 2009
In 2010, the segment's net sales were $5.1 billion, a 5% increase compared to net sales of $4.9 billion in 2009. The 5% increase in net sales in the Government segment reflects an increase in sales of radios and systems. The increase in net sales for the segment reflects higher net sales in all regions. Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment's business, accounting for approximately 63% of the segment's net sales in both 2010 and 2009. The segment's backlog was $2.0 billion at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.
The segment had operating earnings of $566 million in 2010, compared to operating earnings of $542 million in 2009. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, driven by the 5% increase in net sales and a favorable product mix, partially offset by: (i) increased SG&A expenses primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses related to the increase in net sales and increased employee benefit-related expenses, and (ii) an increase in R&D expenditures primarily due to investment in next-generation technologies and increased employee benefit-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales in 2010 as compared to 2009, gross margin increased slightly, SG&A expenses increased and R&D expenditures decreased.
Segment Results2009 Compared to 2008
In 2009, the segment's net sales were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to net sales of $5.3 billion in 2008. The 7% decrease in net sales reflects a decrease in spending primarily due to customer budget constraints, particularly in the U.S. The segment's net sales were lower in North America, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and Latin America and higher in Asia. Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment's business, accounting for approximately 63% of the segment's net sales in 2009, and approximately 61% in 2008. The segment's backlog was $2.0 billion at both December 31, 2009 and 2008.
The segment had operating earnings of $542 million in 2009, compared to operating earnings of $630 million in 2008. The decrease in the operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, driven by the 7% decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix. The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by decreases in SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures,
 
primarily related to: (i) savings from cost-reduction initiatives, and (ii) decreased employee benefit-related expenses, including the temporary suspension of the Company's 401(k) matching contributions. As a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared 2008, gross margin and SG&A expenses decreased and R&D expenditures increased.
Enterprise Segment
In 2010, the segment's net sales represented 35% of the Company's consolidated net sales, compared to 32% in 2009 and 35% in 2008.
 
Segment Results2010 Compared to 2009
In 2010, the segment's net sales were $2.7 billion, a 19% increase compared to net sales of $2.3 billion in 2009. The 19% increase in net sales in the Enterprise segment reflects an increase in mobile computing, scanning devices and iDEN equipment sales. The increase in net sales for the segment reflects higher net sales in all regions. Net sales in North America continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment's business, accounting for approximately 49% of the segment's net sales in 2010, and approximately 51% in 2009. The segment's backlog was $568 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $576 million at December 31, 2009.
The segment had operating earnings of $212 million in 2010, compared to operating earnings of $28 million in 2009. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, driven by the 19% increase in net sales and a favorable product mix, partially offset by: (i) increased SG&A expenses primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses related to the increase in net sales and increased employee benefit-related expenses, and (ii) an increase in R&D expenditures primarily due to investment in next-generation technologies and increased employee benefit-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales in 2010 as compared to 2009, gross margin, SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures all decreased.
Segment Results2009 Compared to 2008
In 2009, the segment's net sales were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 20% compared to net sales of $2.8 billion in 2008. The 20% decrease in net sales reflects the economic challenges facing the commercial and retail markets we serve. The segment's net sales were lower in all regions. Net sales in North America comprised a significant portion of the segment's business, accounting for approximately 51% of the segment's net sales in 2009, and approximately 52% in 2008. The segment's backlog was $576 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $559 million at December 31, 2008.
The segment had operating earnings of $28 million in 2009, compared to incurring an operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2008. The increase in the operating earnings was primarily due to a $1.6 billion decrease in Other charges, primarily due to the absence in 2009 of a comparable $1.6 billion charge in 2008 related to asset impairments. Also contributing to the increase in operating earnings were decreases in SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures, primarily related to: (i) savings from cost-reduction initiatives, and (ii) decreased employee benefit-related expenses, reflecting the temporary suspension of the Company's 401(k) matching contributions. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin, driven by the 20% decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix. As a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared 2008, gross margin, SG&A expenses and R&D expenditures all increased.

During 2010, the Company implemented various productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. In 2010, The Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $73 million, relating to the separation of 1,600 employees, of which 800 were direct employees and 800 were indirect employees. These charges included $19 million of Costs of sales and $54 million of charges under Other charges in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Included in the aggregate $73 million are charges of $73 million for employee separation costs, $16 million for exit costs, partially offset by $16 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.
The Company realized cost-saving benefits of approximately $28 million in 2010 from the plans that were initiated during 2010, representing: (i) $14 million of savings in SG&A expenses, (ii) $10 million of savings in Costs of sales, and (iii) $4 million of savings in R&D expenditures. Beyond 2010, the Company expects the reorganization plans initiated during 2010 to provide annualized cost savings of approximately $108 million.
During 2009, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $102 million, including $114 million for employee separation costs, $6 million for exit costs, partially offset by $18 million for reversals of accruals no longer needed. During 2008, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $65 million, including $80 million for employee separation costs, partially offset by $15 million of reversals of accruals no longer needed.
 
The following table displays the net charges incurred by business segment:
 
Cash payments for exit costs and employee separations in connection with these reorganization plans were $53 million in 2010, as compared to $111 million in 2009. The $67 million reorganization of businesses accrual at December 31, 2010, includes: (i) $50 million relating to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid in 2011, and (ii) $17 million relating to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company increased the aggregate of our: (i) cash and cash equivalents balances, (ii) Sigma Fund and short-term investments, and (iii) long-term Sigma Fund, by $904 million from $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2009 to $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2010. Conversely, the Company decreased the aggregate of our: (i) notes payable and the current portion of long-term debt, and (ii) long-term debt, by approximately $1.1 billion from $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2009 to $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2010.
As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company's liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components: (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) operating activities, (iii) investing activities, and (iv) financing activities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
At December 31, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents (which are highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less) were $4.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, $1.2 billion of this amount was held in the U.S. and $3.0 billion was held by the Company or its subsidiaries in other countries. At December 31, 2010, restricted cash was $226 million (including $166 million held outside the U.S.), compared to $206 million (including $143 million held outside the U.S.) at December 31, 2009.
The Company continues to analyze and review various repatriation strategies to continue to efficiently repatriate funds. In 2010, the Company repatriated approximately $1.1 billion in funds to the U.S. from international jurisdictions with minimal cash tax cost. The Company has approximately $3.2 billion of earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are not permanently reinvested and may be repatriated without additional U.S. federal income tax charges to the Company's consolidated statements of operations, given the U.S. federal tax provisions accrued on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available foreign tax credits. On a cash basis, these repatriations from the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries could require the payment of additional foreign taxes. Repatriation of some of these funds could be subject to delay for local country approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences.
On January 4, 2011, the Distribution of Motorola Mobility from Motorola Solutions was completed. As part of the Distribution, the Company contributed $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents to Motorola Mobility and has an obligation to fund an additional $300 million, upon receipt of cash distributions as a result of future capital reductions of an overseas subsidiary.
Operating Activities
The cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2010 was $818 million, compared to $628 million in 2009 and $884 million in 2008. The primary contributors to the cash provided in 2010 were: (i) income from continuing operations (adjusted for net non-cash charges) of $1.0 billion, and (ii) a $333 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by: (i) a $308 million decrease in other assets and liabilities, (ii) a $111 million increase in inventories, and (iii) an $83 million increase in accounts receivable.
 The Company's net accounts receivable were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The Company's businesses sell their products in a variety of markets throughout the world and payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location. Accordingly, the Company's levels of net accounts receivable can be impacted by the timing and level of sales that are made by its various businesses and by the geographic locations in which those sales are made.
Accounts Receivable:
As further described below under "Sales of Receivables," the Company's levels of net accounts receivable can also be impacted by the timing and amount of accounts receivable sold to third parties, which can vary by period and can be impacted by numerous factors.
 
 The Company's net inventory was $521 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $409 million at December 31, 2009. Inventory management continues to be an area of focus as the Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to its customers against the risk of inventory excess and obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer spending requirements.
Inventory:
 The Company's accounts payable were $731 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $569 million at December 31, 2009. The Company buys products in a variety of markets throughout the world and payment terms can vary by market type and geographic location. Accordingly, the Company's levels of accounts payable can be impacted by the timing and level of purchases made by its various businesses and by the geographic locations in which those purchases are made.
Accounts Payable:
 The Company contributed $157 million to its U.S. pension plans during 2010, compared to $90 million contributed in 2009. The Company contributed $47 million to its non-U.S. pension plans during 2010, compared to $39 million contributed in 2009. In January 2011, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") announced an agreement with Motorola Solutions under which the Company will contribute $100 million above and beyond its legal requirement to its U.S. noncontributory pension plan ("U.S. Regular Pension Plan") over the next five years. The Company and the PBGC entered into the agreement as the Company was in the process of separating Motorola Mobility and pursuing the sale of certain assets of the Networks business. Also in January 2011, the Company elected the available optional pension contribution relief which reduced its required 2011 U.S. Regular Pension Plan contribution from approximately $265 million to approximately $235 million. During 2011, the Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $240 million to its U.S. pension plans and approximately $40 million to its non-U.S. pension plans. The Company maintained all of the U.S. pension liabilities and the majority of the non-U.S. pension liabilities following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility on January 4, 2011.
Benefit Plan Contributions:
The Company amended its U.S. Regular Pension Plan, the Officers' Plan and the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan such that: (i) no participant shall accrue any benefits or additional benefits on or after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on or after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit.
The Company made no contributions to its Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in either 2010 or 2009, and expects to make no contributions to this plan in 2011. The Company maintained the entire Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan liability following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility on January 4, 2011. Retirement benefits are further discussed below in the "Significant Accounting PoliciesRetirement Benefits" section.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $523 million in 2010, compared to net cash used of $531 million in 2009 and net cash provided of $1 billion in 2008. The $1.1 billion increase in net cash provided by investing activities from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to a $1.4 billion increase in cash received from net sales of Sigma Fund investments, partially offset by: (i) a $192 million decrease in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, and (ii) a $93 million decrease in net proceeds from sales of investments and businesses.
 The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries invest most of their U.S. dollar-denominated cash in a fund (the "Sigma Fund") that allows the Company to efficiently manage its cash around the world. The Company had net cash inflow from net proceeds from sales of $453 million of Sigma Fund investments in 2010, compared to a net cash outflow of $922 million in net purchases of Sigma Fund investments in 2009 and a net cash inflow of $853 million of net proceeds received from sales of Sigma Fund investments in 2008. The aggregate fair value of Sigma Fund investments was $4.7 billion at December 31, 2010 (including $1.9 billion held by the Company or its subsidiaries outside the U.S.), compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2009 (including $2.3 billion held by the Company or its subsidiaries outside the U.S.).
Sigma Fund:
The Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four independent investment management firms. The investment guidelines of the Sigma Fund require that purchased investments must be in high-quality, investment grade (rated at least A/A-1 by Standard & Poor's or A2/P-1 by Moody's Investors Service), U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset- and mortgage-backed securities. Under the Sigma Fund's investment policies, except for debt obligations of the U.S. government, agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, no more than 5% of the Sigma Fund portfolio is to consist of debt obligations of any one issuer. The Sigma Fund's investment policies further require that floating rate investments must have a maturity at purchase date that does not exceed thirty-six months with an interest rate that is reset at least annually. The average interest rate reset of the investments held by the funds must be 120 days or less. The actual average interest rate reset of the portfolio (excluding cash and defaulted securities) was 18 days at December 31, 2010, compared to 15 days at December 31, 2009.
Investments in the Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. The Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models and broker quotes to determine the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party pricing services, and use a number of standard inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where the counterparty is standing ready and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.
 
At December 31, 2010, $4.7 billion of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as current in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009. The weighted average maturity of the Sigma Fund investments classified as current was 1 month (excluding cash of $2.4 billion and defaulted securities) at December 31, 2010, compared to 1 month (excluding cash of $202 million and defaulted securities) at December 31, 2009. A majority of the Sigma Fund's cash balance at December 31, 2010 was reserved for the Distribution of Motorola Mobility. At December 31, 2010, approximately 99% of the Sigma Fund investments were invested in cash and U.S. government, agency and government-sponsored enterprise obligations. This reflects a strategic decision by the Company to prioritize capital preservation rather than investment income.
In 2010, the Company recorded a gain from the Sigma Fund investments of $11 million in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, compared to a gain from the Sigma Fund investments of $80 million in 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed its accounting for changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company distinguished between declines it considered temporary and declines it considered other-than-temporary. When it became probable that the Company would not collect all amounts it was owed on a security according to its contractual terms, the Company considered the security to be impaired and recorded the other-than-temporary decline in fair value in earnings. In 2008, the Company recorded $186 million of other-than-temporary impairments of Sigma Fund investments in the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charges were primarily related to the default of investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Washington Mutual, Inc. and Sigma Finance Corporation, an unrelated special investment vehicle managed by United Kingdom-based Gordian Knot, Limited.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company began recording all changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company recorded the cumulative loss of $101 million on investments in the Sigma Fund investments in its consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company determined amounts that arose in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2008 were not material to the consolidated results of operations in those periods.
Securities with a maturity greater than 12 months and defaulted securities have been classified as non-current in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2010, $70 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current, and the weighted average maturity of the Sigma Fund investments classified as non-current (excluding defaulted securities) was 164 months. At December 31, 2009, $66 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current.
The Company continuously assesses its cash needs and continues to believe that the balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and investments in the Sigma Fund classified as current are more than adequate to meet its current operating requirements over the next twelve months.
 The Company used net cash for acquisitions and new investment activities of $23 million in 2010, compared to net cash used of $17 million in 2009 and net cash used of $208 million in 2008. The cash used in 2010 and 2009 were for small strategic investments across the Company.
Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:
 Capital expenditures were $192 million in 2010, compared to $136 million in 2009 and $257 million in 2008. The Company's emphasis when making capital expenditure decisions is to focus on strategic investments driven by customer demand and new design capability.
Capital Expenditures:
 The Company received $264 million in net proceeds from the sales of investments and businesses in 2010, compared to proceeds of $357 million in 2009 and proceeds of $113 million in 2008. The $264 million in proceeds in 2010 were primarily comprised of the Company's Israel-based wireless network operator business and the sale of a single investment. The $357 million in proceeds in 2009 was primarily comprised of net proceeds received in connection with sales of: (i) Good Technology, (ii) the biometrics business, and (iii) the sales of certain of the Company's equity investments.
Sales of Investments and Businesses:
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities was $55 million in 2010, compared to $278 million used in 2009 and $1.4 billion used in 2008. Cash used for financing activities in the 2010 was primarily comprised of approximately $1.0 billion for repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by: (i) $782 million of distributions from discontinued operations, and (ii) $179 million of net cash received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan.
Cash used for financing activities in 2009 was primarily: (i) $132 million of cash used for the repayment of long-term debt, (ii) $114 million of cash used to pay dividends, (iii) $86 million of cash used for the repayment of short-term borrowings, and (iv) $68 million of distributions to discontinued operations, partially offset by $116 million of cash received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan.
 At December 31, 2010, the Company's outstanding notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $605 million, compared to $536 million at December 31, 2009.
Short-Term Debt:
 
In November 2010, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire $527 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 7.625% Notes due November 15, 2010.
 At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding long-term debt of $2.1 billion, compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2009.
Long-term Debt:
During the second quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased approximately $500 million of its outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $477 million, excluding approximately $5 million of accrued interest. The $500 million of long-term debt repurchased included principal amounts of: (i) $65 million of the $379 million then outstanding of the 6.50% Debentures due 2025 (the "2025 Debentures"), (ii) $75 million of the $286 million then outstanding of the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 (the "2028 Debentures"), (iii) $222 million of the $446 million then outstanding of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037 (the "2037 Senior Notes"), and (iv) $138 million of the $252 million then outstanding of the 5.22% Debentures due 2097. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, the Company recognized a loss of approximately $12 million related to this debt tender in Other within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company repurchased $199 million of its outstanding long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of $133 million, including $4 million of accrued interest. The $199 million of long-term debt repurchased included principal amounts of: (i) $11 million of the $358 million then outstanding of 7.50% Debentures due 2025, (ii) $20 million of the $399 million then outstanding 2025 Debentures, (iii) $14 million of the $299 million then outstanding 2028 Debentures, and (iv) $154 million of the $600 million then outstanding 2037 Senior Notes. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $67 million related to these open market purchases in Other within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
The three largest U.S. national ratings agencies rate the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt investment grade. The Company believes that it will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets at its current ratings. Any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may result in higher funding costs for the Company and adversely affect its ability to access funds.
The Company may from time to time seek to retire certain of its outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
 During 2010, the Company did not pay cash dividends to holders of its common stock. During 2009, the Company paid $114 million in cash dividends to holders of its common stock, all of which was paid during the first quarter of 2009, related to the payment of a dividend declared in November 2008. In February 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors suspended the declaration of quarterly cash dividends on the Company's common stock.
Payment of Dividends:
Credit Facilities
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a domestic syndicated revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Facility"), scheduled to mature in December 2011. The size of the Credit Facility was the lesser of: (1) $1.5 billion, or (2) an amount determined based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory. If the Company elected to borrow under the Credit Facility, only then and not before, it would be required to pledge its domestic accounts receivable and, at its option, domestic inventory. The Credit Facility did not require the Company to meet any financial covenants unless remaining availability under the Credit Facility was less than $225 million. The Company never borrowed under this Credit Facility or predecessor domestic syndicated revolving credit facilities.
On January 4, 2011, the Company terminated the Credit Facility and entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (the "2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement") that is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2014. The 2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a provision pursuant to which the Company can increase the aggregate credit facility size up to a maximum of $2.0 billion by adding lenders or having existing lenders increase their commitments. The Company must comply with certain customary covenants, including maintaining maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios as defined in the 2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement.
 
Contractual Obligations and Other Purchase Commitments
Summarized in the table below are the Company's obligations and commitments to make future payments as of January 4, 2011, following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility.
 
Amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments.
 All of the publicly-held long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, remained with Motorola Solutions following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility and totaled $2.7 billion.
Long-Term Debt Obligations:
 The Company owns most of its major facilities, but does lease certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, information technology and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases. Following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, the Motorola Solutions' future minimum lease obligations, net of minimum sublease rentals, totaled $343 million. Rental expense, net of sublease income, was $131 million in 2010, $146 million in 2009 and $171 million in 2008.
Lease Obligations:
 Following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, Motorola Solutions has approximately $198 million of unrecognized income tax benefits relating to multiple tax jurisdictions and tax years. Based on the potential outcome of the Company's global tax examinations, or the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next 12 months. The associated net tax impact on the effective tax rate, exclusive of valuation allowance changes, is estimated to be in the range of a $50 million tax charge to a $75 million tax benefit, with cash payments not expected to exceed $100 million.
Tax Obligations:
 The Company has entered into agreements for the purchase of inventory, license of software, promotional activities and research and development, which are firm commitments and are not cancelable. Following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, the Motorola Solutions' obligations in connection with these agreements run through 2013, and the total payments expected to be made by the Company under these agreements totaled $106 million.
Purchase Obligations:
The Company enters into a number of arrangements for the sourcing of supplies and materials with take-or-pay obligations. Following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, the Motorola Solutions' obligations with these suppliers run through 2013 and total a minimum purchase obligation of $83 million. The Company does not anticipate the cancellation of any of these agreements in the future and estimates that purchases from these suppliers will exceed the minimum obligations during the agreement periods.
 In January 2011, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") announced an agreement with Motorola Solutions under which the Company will contribute $100 million above and beyond its legal requirement to its U.S. Regular Pension Plan over the next five years. The Company and the PBGC entered into the agreement as the Company was in the process of separating Motorola Mobility and pursuing the sale of certain assets of the Networks business.
Other Obligations:
As part of the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, the Company has an obligation to fund an additional $300 million, upon receipt of cash distributions as a result of future capital reductions of an overseas subsidiary.
 The Company has entered into certain long-term agreements to purchase software, components, supplies and materials from suppliers. Most of the agreements extend for periods of one to three years (three to five years for software). Generally, these agreements do not obligate the Company to make any purchases, and many permit the Company to terminate the agreement with advance notice (usually ranging from 60 to 180 days). If the Company were to terminate these agreements, it generally would be liable for certain termination charges, typically based on work performed and supplier on-hand inventory and raw materials attributable to canceled orders. The Company's liability would only arise in the event it terminates the agreements for reasons other than "cause."
Commitments Under Other Long-Term Agreements:
 
The Company outsources certain corporate functions, such as benefit administration and information technology-related services. These contracts are expected to expire in 2013. Following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility, the Motorola Solutions' total remaining payments under these contracts are approximately $517 million over the remaining life of the contracts; however these contracts can be terminated. Termination would result in a penalty substantially less than the remaining annual contract payments. The Company would also be required to find another source for these services, including the possibility of performing them in-house.
As is customary in bidding for and completing certain projects and pursuant to a practice the Company has followed for many years, the Company has a number of performance/bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding (collectively, referred to as "Performance Bonds"), primarily relating to projects of the Government segment, including projects related to discontinued operations. These Performance Bonds normally have maturities of multiple years and are standard in the industry as a way to give customers a convenient mechanism to seek resolution if a contractor does not satisfy certain requirements under a contract. Typically, a customer can draw on the Performance Bond only if the Company does not fulfill all terms of a project contract. If such an occasion occurred, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the institution that issued the Performance Bond for the amounts paid. In its long history, it has been rare for the Company to have a Performance Bond drawn upon. At December 31, 2010, outstanding Performance Bonds totaled approximately $1.7 billion, compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009. Following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility and the completion of the divesture of the Networks business, Motorola Solutions' outstanding Performance Bonds totaled approximately $1.2 billion. Any future disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the bank, insurance or capital markets, or a change in the Company's credit ratings could adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain Performance Bonds and may result in higher funding costs.
 Under the definition contained in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
Long-term Customer Financing Commitments
 Certain purchasers of the Company's infrastructure equipment may request that the Company provide long-term financing (defined as financing with a term of greater than one year) in connection with the sale of equipment. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment. The Company's obligation to provide long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from the Company. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $333 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $406 million at December 31, 2009 (including $168 million and $321 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, relating to discontinued operations). Of these amounts, $27 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank commitments to purchase long-term receivables at December 31, 2010, compared to $13 million supported at December 31, 2009 (including $25 million at December 31, 2010 and no amounts at December 31, 2009, relating to the Networks business). The majority of the outstanding commitments at December 31, 2010 are to a small number of network operators in the Middle East region. The Company retains the funded portion of the financing arrangements related to the Networks business following the sale to NSN, which totaled approximately $235 million at December 31, 2010.
Outstanding Commitments:
 In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining financing directly from banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling $10 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009 (including $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables). Customer financing guarantees outstanding were $1 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $2 million at December 31, 2009 (including de minimus amounts at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, relating to the sale of short-term receivables).
Guarantees of Third-Party Debt:
 The Company had net long-term receivables of $264 million, (net of allowances for losses of $1 million) at December 31, 2010, compared to net long-term receivables of $130 million, (net of allowances for losses of $7 million) at December 31, 2009. These long-term receivables are generally interest bearing, with interest rates ranging from 2% to 12%.
Outstanding Long-Term Receivables:
Sales of Receivables
From time to time, the Company sells accounts receivable and long-term receivables on a non-recourse basis to third parties under one-time arrangement while others are sold to third parties under committed facilities that involve contractual commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be renewed annually. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term receivables.
 
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a $200 million revolving receivable sales facility, maturing June 2011, for the sale of accounts receivable, which was fully available. The initial cash proceeds received by the Company for the sale of these receivables is capped at the lower of $200 million or eligible receivables less reserves. At December 31, 2009, the Company had a $200 million committed revolving credit facility for the sale of accounts receivable, of which $140 million was available. The Company had no significant committed facilities for the sale of long-term receivables at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The following table summarizes the proceeds received from non-recourse sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
 
At December 31, 2010, the Company retained servicing obligations for $329 million of sold accounts receivables and $277 million of long-term receivables, compared to $141 million of accounts receivables and $297 million of long-term receivables at December 31, 2009.
Under certain arrangements, the value of accounts receivable sold is supported by credit insurance purchased from third-party insurance companies, less deductibles or self-insurance requirements under the insurance policies. Under these arrangements, the Company's total credit exposure, less insurance coverage, to outstanding accounts receivable that have been sold was de minimus at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.
Adequate Internal Funding Resources
The Company believes that it has adequate internal resources available to fund expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months as supported by the level of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and Sigma Fund balances in the U.S. and the ability to repatriate funds from foreign jurisdictions.
Other Contingencies
 In certain circumstances, our businesses may enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the damages that could be claimed by the other party for failed performance might exceed the revenue the Company receives from the contract. Contracts with these types of uncapped damage provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still represent meaningful risk. There is a possibility that a damage claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result in expenses to the Company that are far in excess of the revenue received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.
Potential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying Contract Value:
 In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial, intellectual property and divestiture agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims asserted against the Company. However, there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the current legal climate. In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. Further, the Company's obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, typically not more than 24 months, and for amounts not in excess of the contract value, and in some instances the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.
Indemnification Provisions:
 During 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with another company to resolve certain intellectual property disputes between the two companies. As a result of the settlement agreement, the Company received $65 million in cash and was assigned certain patent properties. As a result of this agreement, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $39 million (and $55 million was allocated to discontinued operations) during the year ended December 31, 2010, related to the settlement of the outstanding litigation between the parties.
Intellectual Property Matters:
 The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved.
Legal Matters:

Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Motorola Solutions, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Motorola Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Motorola Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2010, the Company adopted revenue recognition guidance for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Motorola Solutions, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly Motorola Solutions, Inc.'s (the "Company" or "Motorola Solutions") consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Changes in Presentation
Motorola Mobility Distribution
On January 4, 2011, the distribution by the Company of all the common stock of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. ("Motorola Mobility") was completed (the "Distribution"). The stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2010 received one (1) share of Motorola Mobility common stock for each eight (8) shares of the Company's common stock held as of the record date. The Distribution was structured to be tax-free to Motorola Solutions and its stockholders for U.S. tax purposes (other than with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares). The historical financial results of Motorola Mobility are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Reverse Stock Split and Name Change
On November 30, 2010, Motorola Solutions announced the timing and details regarding the Distribution and the approval of a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-7. On January 4, 2011, immediately following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility common stock, the Company completed a 1-for-7 reverse stock split ("the Reverse Stock Split") and changed its name to Motorola Solutions, Inc. All consolidated per share information presented gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
Networks Transaction
On July 19, 2010, the Company announced an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities of the Networks business to Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. ("NSN") (the "Transaction"). On April 13, 2011, the Company announced that it and NSN amended this agreement to, among other things, reduce the cash portion of the purchase price from $1.2 billion to $975 million. On April 29, 2011, the Company completed the Transaction, as amended. Based on the terms and conditions of the amended sale agreement, certain assets including $150 million of accounts receivable were excluded from the Transaction. The results of operations of the portions of the Networks business included in the Transaction are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Certain Corporate and general costs which have historically been allocated to the Networks business will remain with the Company after the sale of the Networks business. Additionally, the results of operations of previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the time of their disposition, have been reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. These businesses include: (i) an Israel-based wireless network operator, (ii) the biometrics business, and (iii) Good Technology. The assets and liabilities of the Networks business which were sold to NSN, as well as the assets and liabilities of the previously disposed businesses recorded by the Company prior to the closing of the underlying transactions, are reported as assets and liabilities held for disposition. All previously reported financial information has been revised to conform to the current presentation.
 
Change in Segmentation
Following the Distribution, Motorola Solutions reports financial results for the following two segments:
 
 
Revenue Recognition
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance which amended the accounting standards for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The new guidance changes the criteria required to separate deliverables into separate units of accounting when they are sold in a bundled arrangement and requires an entity to allocate an arrangement's consideration using estimated selling prices ("ESP") of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price ("VSOE") or third-party evidence of selling price ("TPE"). The new guidance also eliminates the use of the residual method to allocate an arrangement's consideration.
In October 2009, the FASB also issued new guidance to remove from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality.
The new accounting guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after June 15, 2010. The standards permit prospective or retrospective adoption as well as early adoption. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2010 on a prospective basis for applicable arrangements that were entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2010.
The Company's material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of activities, from the delivery of stand-alone equipment to custom design and installation over a period of time to bundled sales of devices, equipment, software and services. The Company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of its product and service offerings due to the needs of its customers. Additionally, many of the Company's products have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the product's essential functionality. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. In addition to these general revenue recognition criteria, the following specific revenue recognition policies are followed:
For product and equipment sales, revenue recognition generally occurs when products or equipment have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. The Company bases its estimates of these allowances on historical experience taking into consideration the type of products sold, the type of customer, and the specific type of transaction in each arrangement. Where customer incentives cannot be reliably estimated, the Company recognizes revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer.
Products and Equipment
For long-term contracts that involve customization of the Company's equipment or software, the Company generally recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs to complete the contract. In certain instances, when revenues or costs associated with long-term contracts cannot be reliably estimated or the contract contains other inherent uncertainties, revenues and costs are deferred until the project is complete and customer acceptance is obtained. When current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a contract loss, the loss is recognized in the period it becomes evident.
Long-Term Contracts
Revenue for services is generally recognized ratably over the contract term as services are performed.
Services
Revenue from pre-paid perpetual licenses is recognized at the inception of the arrangement, presuming all other relevant revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue from non-perpetual licenses or term licenses is recognized ratably over the period that the licensee uses the license. Revenue from software maintenance, technical support and unspecified upgrades is generally recognized over the period that these services are delivered.
Software and Licenses
Arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including any combination of products, equipment, services and software. These multiple element arrangements could also include an element accounted for as a long-term contract coupled with other products, equipment, services and software. For the Company's multiple-element arrangements where at least one of the deliverables is not subject to existing software revenue recognition guidance, deliverables are separated into more than one unit of accounting when (i) the delivered element(s) have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and (ii) delivery of the undelivered element(s) is probable and substantially in the control of the Company. Based on the new accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2010, revenue is then allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting based first on VSOE if it exists, based next on TPE if VSOE does not exist, and, finally, if both VSOE and TPE do not exist, based on ESP.
Multiple-Element Arrangements
 
 
 
Once elements of an arrangement are separated into more than one unit of accounting, revenue is recognized for each separate unit of accounting based on the nature of the revenue as described above.
The Company's arrangements with multiple deliverables may also contain a stand-alone software deliverable that is subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance. The revenue for these multiple-element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverable and the non-software deliverable(s) based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the new revenue accounting guidance. In circumstances where the Company cannot determine VSOE or TPE of the selling price for all of the deliverables in the arrangement, including the software deliverable, ESP is used for the purpose of allocating the arrangement consideration.
The Company's arrangements with multiple deliverables may be comprised entirely of deliverables that are all still subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance. For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to the deliverables based on VSOE. Should VSOE not exist for the undelivered software element, revenue is deferred until either the undelivered element is delivered or VSOE is established for the element, whichever occurs first. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.
Net sales as reported and pro forma net sales that would have been reported during the year ended December 31, 2010, if the transactions entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2010 were still subject to the previous accounting guidance are shown in the following table (in millions):
 
The difference in the as reported revenue as compared to the pro forma basis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 is due to the Company no longer using the residual method for allocating revenue to the delivered products in a multiple-element arrangement when VSOE exists for the undelivered element but not the delivered element. This situation is most prevalent for system solutions that were sold with additional deliverables that are not in the scope of contract accounting. Under the prior accounting guidance for revenue recognition, the Company would ascribe the residual value to the contract accounting deliverable only when VSOE for the undelivered services or other products in the arrangement could be determined.
Based on the Company's current sales strategies, the newly adopted accounting guidance for revenue recognition is not expected to have a significant effect on the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for sales in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple-element arrangements. However, the Company expects that this new accounting guidance will facilitate the Company's efforts to optimize its product and service offerings due to better alignment of the economics of an arrangement and the related
 
accounting treatment. This may lead to the Company engaging in new sales practices in the future. As these go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP. As a result, the Company's future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from the results reported in the current period.
Changes in cost estimates and the fair values of certain deliverables could negatively impact the Company's operating results. In addition, unforeseen conditions could arise over the contract term that may have a significant impact on operating results.
The Company records taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions, including sales, use, value added and excise taxes, on a net basis with such taxes excluded from revenue.
Sales and Use Taxes
 The Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2010, and 2009, restricted cash was $226 million and $206 million, respectively.
Cash Equivalents:
 The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries invest a significant portion of their U.S. dollar-denominated cash in a fund (the "Sigma Fund") that allows the Company to efficiently manage its cash around the world. The Sigma Fund portfolio is managed by four independent investment management firms. The investment guidelines of the Sigma Fund require that purchased investments must be in high-quality, investment grade (rated at least A/A-1 by Standard & Poor's or A2/P-1 by Moody's Investors Service), U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government bonds, corporate bonds and asset- and mortgage-backed securities. Under the Sigma Fund's investment policies, except for debt obligations of the U.S. government, agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, no more than 5% of the Sigma Fund portfolio is to consist of debt obligations of any one issuer. The Sigma Fund's investment policies further require that floating rate investments must have a maturity at purchase date that does not exceed thirty-six months with an interest rate that is reset at least annually. The average interest rate reset of the investments held by the funds must be 120 days or less.
Sigma Fund:
Investments in the Sigma Fund are carried at fair value. The Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models and broker quotes to determine the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. The valuation models are developed and maintained by third-party pricing services and use a number of standard inputs to the valuation models, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where the counterparty is standing ready and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.
 Investments in equity and debt securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities that are restricted for more than one year or that are not publicly traded are carried at cost. Certain investments are accounted for using the equity method if the Company has significant influence over the issuing entity.
Investments:
The Company assesses declines in the fair value of investments to determine whether such declines are other-than-temporary. This assessment is made considering all available evidence, including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the entity issuing the security, and the Company's ability and intent to hold investment until recovery. Other-than-temporary impairments of investments are recorded to Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they become impaired.
Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost (which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).
Inventories:
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using straight-line and declining-balance methods, based on the estimated useful lives of the assets (buildings and building equipment, 5-40 years; machinery and equipment, 2-10 years) and commences once the assets are ready for their intended use.
Property, Plant and Equipment:
 Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit's fair value to determine the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from one to 13 years. The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
 Long-lived assets, which include intangible assets, held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset (group) to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (group). If an asset is considered to be impaired, the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
 
impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset's fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flows analysis or market comparables. Assets held for sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.
Income Taxes:
Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence. Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable. The sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carry-back years and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense and penalties in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
 Long-term receivables include trade receivables where contractual terms of the note agreement are greater than one year. Long-term receivables are considered impaired when management determines collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement, including principal and interest, is no longer probable. Impaired long-term receivables are valued based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the receivable's effective rate of interest, or the fair value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent. Interest income and late fees on impaired long-term receivables are recognized only when payments are received. Previously impaired long-term receivables are no longer considered impaired and are reclassified to performing when they have performed under a workout or restructuring for four consecutive quarters.
Long-term Receivables:
 Certain of the Company's non-U.S. operations use their respective local currency as their functional currency. Those operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. For those operations that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, transactions denominated in the local currency are measured in U.S. dollars using the current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are included in Other within Other income (expense) within the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
Foreign Currency:
 Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are marked-to-market and the result is included in Other within Other income (expense) within the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are used to hedge firm future commitments or forecasted transactions are deferred until such time as the underlying transactions are recognized or recorded immediately when the transaction is no longer expected to occur. Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognized immediately as income or expense.
Derivative Instruments:
 The Company calculates its basic earnings (loss) per share based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding. Net earnings (loss) attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. is divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period to arrive at the basic earnings (loss) per share. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic earnings (loss) per share calculation and the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, excluding those securities that would be anti-dilutive to the earnings (loss) per share calculation. Both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated for earnings (loss) from continuing operations and net earnings (loss) attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. for all periods presented. All earnings (loss) per share information presented gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on January 4, 2011.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share:
 The Company has incentive plans that reward employees with stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, as well as an employee stock purchase plan. The amount of compensation cost for these share-based awards is measured based on the fair value of the awards, as of the date that the share-based awards are issued and adjusted to the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of stock options, stock appreciation rights and the employee stock purchase plan is generally determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which incorporates assumptions about expected volatility, risk free rate, dividend yield, and expected life. Compensation cost for share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Share-Based Compensation Costs:
 
 The Company records annual expenses relating to its pension benefit and postretirement plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of the gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are amortized over future service periods. The funding status, or projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for each plan, is reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets using a December 31 measurement date.
Retirement Benefits:
 Advertising expenses, which are the external costs of marketing the Company's products, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $109 million, $123 million and $184 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Advertising Expense:
 The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term receivables, inventories, Sigma Fund, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations, indemnifications and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits and allowances for discounts, price protection, product returns and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency, energy markets and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
Use of Estimates:
 
On July 19, 2010, the Company announced an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities of the Networks business to Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. ("NSN") (the "Transaction"). On April 13, 2011, the Company announced that it and NSN amended this agreement to, among other things, reduce the cash portion of the purchase price from $1.2 billion to $975 million. On April 29, 2011, the Company completed the Transaction, as amended. Based on the terms and conditions of the amended sale agreement, certain assets including $150 million of accounts receivable were excluded from the Transaction. The results of operations of the portions of the Networks business included in the Transaction are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
On January 4, 2011, the distribution by the Company of all the common stock of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. ("Motorola Mobility") was completed (the "Distribution"). The stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2010 received one (1) share of Motorola Mobility common stock for each eight (8) shares of the Company's common stock held as of the record date. Immediately following the Distribution, the Company changed its name to Motorola Solutions, Inc. The Distribution was structured to be tax-free to Motorola Solutions and its stockholders for U.S. tax purposes (other than with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares). The historical financial results of Motorola Mobility are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During the second quarter of 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Israel-based wireless network operator business formerly included as part of the Government segment. The Company received $170 million in net cash and recorded a gain on sale of the business of $20 million before income taxes, which is included in Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of: (i) Good Technology, and (ii) the biometrics business, which includes its Printrak trademark. Collectively, the Company received $163 million in net cash and recorded a net gain on sale of the businesses of $175 million before income taxes, which is included in Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
 
The results of operations of Motorola Mobility, and the portions of the Networks business included in the transaction with NSN, as well as the results of operations of the previously disposed businesses discussed above, which were deemed to be immaterial for presentation as discontinued operations at the time of their disposition, are reported as discontinued operations. All previously reported financial information has been revised to conform to the current presentation.
The following table displays summarized activity in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share from both continuing operation and on a net earnings basis for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, 14.6 million and 22.7 million, respectively, out-of-the-money stock options and the assumed vesting of 0.7 million and 2.2 million, respectively, restricted stock units were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company was in a net loss position and, accordingly, the assumed exercise of 33.2 million stock options and the assumed vesting of 3.7 million restricted stock units were excluded from diluted weighted averages outstanding because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.
Pursuant to the completion of the Distribution on January 4, 2011, 8.0 million stock options and 3.8 million unvested restricted stock units held by the employees of Motorola Mobility were cancelled. Upon the completed divestiture of the Networks business on April 29, 2011, approximately 0.2 million stock options and 1.4 million unvested restricted stock units were cancelled.
 
Balance Sheet Information
Sigma Fund
Sigma Fund consists of the following:
 
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded gains related to the Sigma Fund investments of $11 million and $80 million, respectively, in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded total charges related to Sigma Fund investments, including temporary unrealized losses and impairment charges, of $287 million in its consolidated statement of operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed its accounting for changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company distinguished between declines it considered temporary and declines it considered permanent. When it became probable that the Company would not collect all amounts it was owed on a security according to its contractual terms, the Company considered the security to be impaired and recorded the permanent decline in fair value in earnings. During 2008, the Company recorded $186 million of permanent impairments of Sigma Fund investments in the consolidated statement of operations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company began recording all changes in the fair value of investments in the Sigma Fund in the consolidated statements of operations. In its stand-alone financial statements, the Sigma Fund uses "investment company" accounting practices and records all changes in the fair value of the underlying investments in earnings, whether such changes are considered temporary or permanent. The Company determined the underlying accounting practices of the Sigma Fund in its stand-alone financial statements should be retained in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company recorded the cumulative loss of $101 million on investments in the Sigma Fund investments in its consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company determined amounts that arose in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2008 were not material to the consolidated results of operations in those periods.
Securities with a significant temporary unrealized loss and a maturity greater than 12 months and defaulted securities have been classified as non-current in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2010, $70 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current, and the weighted average maturity of the Sigma Fund investments classified as non-current (excluding defaulted securities) was 164 months. At December 31, 2009, $66 million of the Sigma Fund investments were classified as non-current.
Investments
Investments consist of the following:
 
 
 
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded investment impairment charges of $21 million, $75 million and $333 million, respectively, representing other-than-temporary declines in the value of the Company's available-for-sale investment portfolio. Investment impairment charges are included in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
Gains on sales of investments and businesses, consists of the following:
 
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the $49 million of net gains primarily related to sales of a number of the Company's equity investments, of which $31 million of gain was attributable to a single investment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the $108 million of net gains primarily relates to: (i) sales of certain of the Company's equity investments, of which $32 million of gain was attributable to a single investment, and (ii) a net gain on the sales of specific businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the $64 million of net gains primarily related to sales of a number of the Company's equity investments, of which $29 million of gain was attributable to a single investment.

Stockholders' Equity Information
 During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not repurchase any of its common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 1.3 million of its common shares at an aggregate cost of $138 million, or an average cost of $107.24 per share, all of which were repurchased during the three months ended March 29, 2008. These amounts give effect to the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on January 4, 2011.
Share Repurchase Program:
The repurchase of common shares took place under programs approved by the Board of Directors, authorizing the Company to repurchase an aggregate amount of up to $7.5 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock over a period of time. This authorization expired in June 2009 and was not renewed. The Company has not repurchased any shares since the first quarter of 2008. All repurchased shares have been retired.
 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company did not pay cash dividends to holders of its common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company paid $114 million in cash dividends to holders of its common stock, all of which was paid during the first quarter of 2009, related to the payment of a dividend declared in November 2008. In February 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors suspended the declaration of quarterly cash dividends on the Company's common stock.
Payment of Dividends:
 On May 4, 2009, the Company's stockholders approved a change in the par value of Motorola Solutions common stock from $3.00 per share to $.01 per share. The change did not have an impact on the amount of the Company's Total stockholders' equity, but it did result in a reclassification of $6.9 billion between Common stock and Additional paid-in capital.
Par Value Change:
 On January 4, 2011, the distribution of Motorola Mobility from Motorola Solutions was completed. On January 4, 2011, the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2010 received one (1) share of Motorola Mobility common stock for each eight (8) shares of Motorola, Inc. common stock held as of the Record Date. The Distribution was completed pursuant to an Amended and Restated Master Separation and Distribution Agreement, effective as of July 31, 2010, among Motorola, Inc., Motorola Mobility Holdings and Motorola Mobility, Inc.
Motorola Mobility Distribution:
On November 30, 2010, the Company announced the timing and details regarding the Distribution and the approval of a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-7. Immediately following the Distribution of Motorola Mobility common stock, the Company completed a 1-for-7 reverse stock split. All consolidated per share information presented gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
Reverse Stock Split: 
 
Long-Term Debt
 
Other Short-Term Debt
 
 
In November 2010, the Company repaid, at maturity, the entire $527 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 7.625% Notes due November 15, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased approximately $500 million of its outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $477 million, excluding approximately $5 million of accrued interest, all of which occurred during the three months ended July 3, 2010. The $500 million of long-term debt repurchased included principal amounts of: (i) $65 million of the $379 million then outstanding of the 6.50% Debentures due 2025 (the "2025 Debentures"), (ii) $75 million of the $286 million then outstanding of the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 (the "2028 Debentures"), (iii) $222 million of the $446 million then outstanding of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037 (the "2037 Senior Notes"), and (iv) $138 million of the $252 million then outstanding of the 5.22% Debentures due 2097. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, the Company recognized a loss of approximately $12 million related to this debt tender in Other within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased $199 million of its outstanding long-term debt for an aggregate purchase price of $133 million, including $4 million of accrued interest, all of which occurred during the three months ended April 4, 2009. The $199 million of long-term debt repurchased included principal amounts of: (i) $11 million of the $358 million then outstanding of the 7.50% Debentures due 2025, (ii) $20 million of the $399 million then outstanding 2025 Debentures, (iii) $14 million of the $299 million then outstanding 2028 Debentures, and (iv) $154 million of the $600 million then outstanding 2037 Senior Notes. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $67 million related to these open market purchases in Other within Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
Aggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities during the next five years are as follows: 2011$605 million; 2012$405 million; 2013$5 million; 2014$4 million; and 2015$4 million.
Credit Facilities
The Company had a domestic syndicated revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Facility"), scheduled to mature in December 2011. The size of the Credit Facility was the lesser of: (1) $1.5 billion, or (2) an amount determined based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory. If the Company elected to borrow under the Credit Facility, only then and not before, it would be required to pledge its domestic accounts receivables and, at its option, domestic inventory. The Credit Facility did not require the Company to meet any financial covenants unless remaining availability under the Credit Facility was less than $225 million. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Facility.
At December 31, 2010, the commitment fee assessed against the daily average unused amount was 75 basis points.
On January 4, 2011, the Company terminated the Credit Facility and entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (the "2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement") that is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2014. The 2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a provision pursuant to which the Company can increase the aggregate credit facility size up to a maximum of $2.0 billion by adding lenders or having existing lenders increase their commitments. The Company must comply with certain customary covenants, including maintaining maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios as defined in the 2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. The Company has no outstanding borrowings under the 2011 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
Foreign Currency Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. The Company's policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on exchange rate price fluctuations, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into transactions for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure. Instruments that are designated as part of a hedging relationship must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as part of a hedging relationship at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in the market values of hedge instruments must be highly correlated with changes in market values of the underlying hedged items both at the inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
The Company's strategy related to foreign exchange exposure management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows or investments based on the segments' assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts for some of the Company's non-functional currency receivables and payables, which are primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company typically uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency exposures. In addition, the Company enters into derivative contracts for some
 
forecasted transactions, which are designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. A portion of the Company's exposure is from currencies that are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product pricing and component sourcing.
The Company had outstanding foreign exchange notional contracts totaling $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2009, (of which $520 million and $560 million, respectively, was related to discontinued operations). Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions, except for the ineffective portion of the instruments, which are charged to Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
The following table shows the five largest net notional amounts of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of December 31, 2010 and the corresponding positions as of December 31, 2009:
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, income representing the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedge positions was $1 million compared to de minimus income for the year ended December 31, 2009 and expense of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These amounts are included in Other within Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The above amounts include the change in the fair value of derivative contracts related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price. These amounts are excluded from the measure of effectiveness. Expense (income) related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are included in the amounts noted above.
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, on a pre-tax basis, income (expense) of $1 million, $(1) million and $(2) million, respectively, was reclassified from equity to earnings in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
At December 31, 2010, the maximum term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was 12 months. The weighted average duration of the Company's derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was six months.
Interest Rate Risk
At December 31, 2010, the Company has $2.7 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed interest rates.
As part of its liability management program, one of the Company's European subsidiaries has an outstanding interest rate agreement ("Interest Agreement") relating to a Euro-denominated loan. The interest on the Euro-denominated loan is variable. The Interest Agreement changes the characteristics of interest rate payments from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The Interest Agreement is not accounted for as a part of a hedging relationship and, accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the Interest Agreement is included in Other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The weighted average fixed rate payment on the Interest Agreement was 5.18%. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of the Interest Agreement put the Company in a liability position of $3 million and $4 million, respectively.
Counterparty Risk
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. However, the Company's risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. At present time, all of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings. The Company is not exposed to material credit risk with any single counterparty. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was exposed to an aggregate credit risk of approximately $2 million with all counterparties.
 
The following tables summarize the fair values and location in the consolidated balance sheets of all derivative financial instruments held by the Company, including amounts included in held for disposition, at December 31, 2010 and 2009:
 
 
The following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations, including amounts related to discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:

Stockholders' Equity
Derivative instruments activity, net of tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:
 
 
Components of earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
 
Components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:
 
Deferred tax charges that were recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company's consolidated balance sheets resulted from retirement benefit adjustments, currency translation adjustments, net gains (losses) on derivative instruments and fair value adjustments to available-for-sale securities. The adjustments were $41 million, $(26) million and $(738) million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The Company evaluates its permanent reinvestment assertions with respect to foreign earnings at each reporting period and, except for certain earnings that the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely due to the capital requirements of the foreign subsidiaries or due to local country restrictions, accrues for the U.S. federal income taxes applicable to the foreign earnings. Undistributed foreign earnings that the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely, and for which no U.S. federal income taxes have been provided, aggregate to $1.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The portion of earnings not reinvested indefinitely may be distributed without an additional U.S. federal income tax charge given the U.S. federal tax accrued on undistributed earnings and the utilization of available foreign tax credits. In 2010, the Company recognized deferred income tax expense of $287 million related to undistributed foreign earnings; including a charge for certain prior foreign earnings the Company concluded are no longer considered to be permanently reinvested and for a reduction of the invested capital of certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The capital reduction is part of the Company's plan to realign its investment in foreign subsidiaries and is pending approval by certain governmental agencies.
In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law, which eliminated the favorable income tax treatment of Medicare Part D Subsidy receipts effective for tax years starting in 2013. As a result of the tax law change, the Company recorded an $18 million non-cash tax charge to reduce its deferred tax asset associated with Medicare Part D subsidies currently estimated to be received after 2012.
 
Differences between income tax expense (benefit) computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and income tax expense (benefit) as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows:
 
Gross deferred tax assets were $5.7 billion and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, were $5.2 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross deferred tax liabilities were $2.4 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Significant components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
 
The Company accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company makes estimates and judgments with regard to the calculation of certain income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.
The Company evaluates deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required by considering available evidence, including historical and projected taxable income and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible. As of December 31, 2010, the Company's U.S. operations had generated cumulative pre-tax losses over the most recent three year period as a result of the pre-tax losses of Motorola Mobility. Because of the losses at Motorola Mobility, the Company believes that the weight of negative historical evidence precludes it from considering any forecasted income from the Motorola Mobility in its analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. However, based on the sustained profits of other businesses, the Company believes that the weight of positive historical evidence allows it to include forecasted income from the other businesses in its analysis of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. The Company also considered in its analysis tax planning strategies that are prudent and can be reasonably implemented. During 2008, the Company recorded a partial valuation allowance of $2.1 billion against a portion of its U.S. tax carryforwards that were more likely than not to expire. During 2009, the Company increased its U.S. valuation allowance by $90 million, primarily relating to capital losses realized from the disposition of a subsidiary, which is accounted for as
 
part of discontinued operations, offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance for refundable general business credits. During 2010, the U.S. valuation allowance was reduced by $39 million, primarily related to certain of the Company's state tax carryforwards that the Company expects to utilize.
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had valuation allowances of $508 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, against its deferred tax assets, including $187 million and $253 million, respectively, relating to deferred tax assets for non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company's valuation allowances for its non-U.S. subsidiaries had a net decrease of $66 million during 2010. The decrease is primarily caused by exchange rate variances and adjustments to the valuation allowance based on current year activity. The U.S. valuation allowance relates primarily to tax carryforwards, including foreign tax credits, general business credits and tax carryforwards of acquired businesses which have limitations upon their use, state tax carryforwards and future capital losses related to certain investments. The Company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
Tax carryforwards are as follows:
 
The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $198 million and $417 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, of which approximately $20 million and $50 million, respectively, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, net of resulting changes to valuation allowances.
A roll-forward of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
 
During 2010, the Company recorded $157 million of tax benefits related to reductions in unrecognized tax benefits relating to facts that indicate the extent to which certain tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. Additionally, the Company reduced its unrecognized tax benefits by $142 million for settlements with tax authorities, of which $45 million resulted in cash tax payments and the remainder of which reduced tax carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.
 
During 2010, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of Symbol Technologies, Inc.'s 2004 through January 9, 2007 pre-acquisition tax years and Motorola Solutions' 2004 through 2007 tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company's 2008 and 2009 tax years. The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits pending. A summary of open tax years by major jurisdiction is presented below:
 
Although the final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain, based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate disposition of these matters does not expect to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution of the Company's global tax disputes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved.
Based on the potential outcome of the Company's global tax examinations or the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next 12 months. The associated net tax impact on the effective tax rate, exclusive of valuation allowance changes, is estimated to be in the range of a $50 million tax charge to a $75 million tax benefit, with cash payments in the range of $0 to $100 million.
At December 31, 2010, the Company had $25 million and $20 million accrued for interest and penalties, respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $25 million and $15 million accrued for interest and penalties, respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits.
 
Pension Benefit Plans
The Company's noncontributory pension plan (the "Regular Pension Plan") covers U.S. employees who became eligible after one year of service. The benefit formula is dependent upon employee earnings and years of service. Effective January 1, 2005, newly-hired employees were not eligible to participate in the Regular Pension Plan. The Company also provides defined benefit plans which cover non-U.S. employees in certain jurisdictions, principally the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and Korea (the "Non-U.S. Plans"). Other pension plans are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.
The Company has a noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan (the "Officers' Plan") for its officers elected prior to December 31, 1999. The Officers' Plan contains provisions for vesting and funding the participants' expected retirement benefits when the participants meet the minimum age and years of service requirements. Elected officers who were not yet vested in the Officers' Plan as of December 31, 1999 had the option to remain in the Officers' Plan or elect to have their benefit bought out in restricted stock units. Effective December 31, 1999, newly elected officers are not eligible to participate in the Officers' Plan. Effective June 30, 2005, salaries were frozen for this plan.
The Company has an additional noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan ("MSPP"), which provides supplemental benefits to individuals by replacing the Regular Pension Plan benefits that are lost by such individuals under the retirement formula due to application of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. However, elected officers who are covered under the Officers' Plan or who participated in the restricted stock buy-out are not eligible to participate in MSPP. Effective January 1, 2007, eligible compensation was capped at the IRS limit plus $175,000 (the "Cap") or, for those already in excess of the Cap as of January 1, 2007, the eligible compensation used to compute such employee's MSPP benefit for all future years will be the greater of: (i) such employee's eligible compensation as of January 1, 2007 (frozen at that amount), or (ii) the relevant Cap for the given year. Additionally, effective January 1, 2009, the MSPP was closed to new participants unless such participation was required under a prior contractual entitlement.
In February 2007, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan and the MSPP, modifying the definition of average earnings. For the years ended prior to December 31, 2007, benefits were calculated using the rolling average of the highest annual earnings in any five years within the previous ten calendar year period. Beginning in January 2008, the benefit calculation was based on the set of the five highest years of earnings within the ten calendar years prior to December 31, 2007, averaged with earnings from each year after 2007. In addition, effective January 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, modifying the vesting period from five years to three years.
 
In December 2008, the Company amended the Regular Pension Plan, the Officers' Plan and the MSPP. Effective March 1, 2009, (i) no participant shall accrue any benefit or additional benefit on and after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on and after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit. Additionally, no service performed on and after March 1, 2009, shall be considered service for any purpose under the MSPP. The Company recognized a $237 million curtailment gain associated with this plan amendment in 2008.
The net periodic pension cost (benefit) for the Regular Pension Plan, Officers' Plan and MSPP and Non-U.S. plans was as follows:
Regular Pension Plan
 
Officers' Plan and MSPP
 
Non-U.S. Plans
 
 
The status of the Company's plans is as follows:
 
It is estimated that the net periodic cost for 2011 will include amortization of the unrecognized net loss and prior service costs for the Regular Plan, Officers' and MSPP Plans, and Non-U.S. Plans, currently included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, of $187 million, $2 million, and $4 million, respectively.
The Company uses a five-year, market-related asset value method of amortizing asset-related gains and losses. Prior service costs are being amortized over periods ranging from 10 to 12 years. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based upon the projected unit credit cost method.
During March of 2010, the Company recognized a curtailment gain in one of its Non-U.S. plans resulting in a reduction of the amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $22 million. No gain or loss was recognized in the Company's consolidated statement of operations as a result of the curtailment.
In August 2010, the Company created separate Non-U.S. plans in certain locations, pursuant to the Company's separation into two independent, publicly traded companies. The portion of existing pension assets and benefit obligations relating to employees covered by the newly-created plans were transferred to those plans. Prior to this transfer the pension assets and benefit obligations were remeasured resulting in an adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $28 million, net of taxes of $13 million.
As a result of the Company's separation into two independent, publicly traded companies, during the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized a curtailment gain in one of its Non-U.S. plans, resulting in the recognition of a gain in the Company's consolidated statement of operations of $4 million. During the same period, as a result of legislative changes that were finalized in December 2010, the Company changed the index used to estimate cost of living increases. As a result, the Company recorded a $55 million gain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. No gain or loss was recognized in the Company's consolidated statement of operations as a result of the amendment.
Certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost and benefit obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing market rates of a universe of high-quality, non-callable, corporate bonds currently available that, if the obligation were settled at the measurement
 
date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The long-term rates of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, cash and other investments similar to the actual investment mix. In determining the long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the plan funds to be invested.
Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans were as follows:
 
Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans were as follows:
 
The accumulated benefit obligations for the plans were as follows:
 
The Company has adopted a pension investment policy designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. To achieve this, the pension plans retain professional investment managers that invest plan assets in equity and fixed income securities and cash. In addition, some plans invest in insurance contracts. The Company's measurement date of its plan assets and obligations is December 31. The Company has the following target mixes for these asset classes, which are readjusted periodically, when an asset class weighting deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the required return at a reasonable risk level:
 
The weighted-average pension plan asset allocation by asset categories:
 
Within the equity securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded securities including both domestic and international stocks. Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded debt securities ranging from U.S. Treasury issues, corporate debt securities, mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as international debt securities. In the cash and other investments asset class, investments may be in cash, cash equivalents or insurance contracts.
The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $240 million to its U.S. pension plans and approximately $40 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in 2011.
 
The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
 
Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
Certain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic employees meeting certain age and service requirements upon termination of employment (the "Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan"). For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2002, the Company offsets a portion of the postretirement medical costs to the retired participant. As of January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan has been closed to new participants. The benefit obligation and plan assets for the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan have been measured as of December 31, 2010.
The assumptions used were as follows:
 
Net Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan expenses were as follows:
 
 
The funded status of the plan is as follows:
 
Components of accrued postretirement health care cost:
 
During the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law, which eliminated the favorable income tax treatment of Medicare Part D Subsidy receipts effective for tax years starting in 2013. As a result of the tax law change, the Company recorded an $18 million non-cash tax charge to reduce its deferred tax asset associated with Medicare Part D subsidies currently estimated to be received after 2012.
It is estimated that the net periodic cost for the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in 2011 will include amortization of the unrecognized net loss and prior service costs, currently included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, of $11 million.
The Company has adopted an investment policy for plan assets designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. To achieve this, the plan retains professional investment managers that invest plan assets in equity and fixed income securities and cash. The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, as well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to develop its expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the net periodic cost and the net retirement healthcare expense. The Company has the following target mixes for these asset classes, which are readjusted at least periodically, when an asset class weighting deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the required return at a reasonable risk level:
 
 
The weighted-average asset allocation for plan assets by asset categories:
 
Within the equity securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded securities including both domestic and international stocks. Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded debt securities ranging from U.S. Treasury issues, corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed issues, as well as international debt securities. In the cash asset class, investments may be in cash and cash equivalents.
The Company expects to make no cash contributions to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in 2011. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
 
The health care cost trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2010 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is 7.25% for 2011. This rate is expected to remain flat thru 2013, with a decline in years 2014 and 2015 until it reaches 5% in 2016. Beyond 2016, this rate is expected to remain flat at 5%. The health care trend rate used to determine the December 31, 2009 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5%.
Changing the health care trend rate by one percentage point would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net retiree health care expense as follows:
 
The Company maintains a lifetime cap on postretirement health care costs, which reduces the liability duration of the plan. A result of this lower duration is a decreased sensitivity to a change in the discount rate trend assumption with respect to the liability and related expense.
The Company has no significant Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plans outside the United States.
Other Benefit Plans
The Company maintains a number of endorsement split-dollar life insurance policies that were taken out on now-retired officers under a plan that was frozen prior to December 31, 2004. The Company had purchased the life insurance policies to insure the lives of employees and then entered into a separate agreement with the employees that split the policy benefits between the Company and the employee. Motorola Solutions owns the policies, controls all rights of ownership, and may terminate the insurance policies. To effect the split-dollar arrangement, Motorola Solutions endorsed a portion of the death benefits to the employee and upon the death of the employee, the employee's beneficiary typically receives the designated portion of the death benefits directly from the insurance company and the Company receives the remainder of the death benefits.
The Company adopted new accounting guidance on accounting for split-dollar life insurance arrangements as of January 1, 2008. This guidance requires that a liability for the benefit obligation be recorded because the promise of postretirement benefit had not been settled through the purchase of an endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangement. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the Company recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees' expected retirement date of $45 million with the offset reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment to January 1, 2008 Retained earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the amounts of $4 million and $41 million, respectively, in the Company's consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. It is currently expected that minimal cash payments will be required to fund these policies.
 
The net periodic pension cost for these split-dollar life insurance arrangements was $5 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees' expected retirement date of $51 million and $48 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company and certain subsidiaries have various defined contribution plans, in which all eligible employees participate. In the U.S., the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees' contributions. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired employees have a higher maximum matching contribution at 4% on the first 5% of employee contributions, compared to 3% on the first 6% of employee contributions for employees hired prior to January 2005. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company temporarily suspended all matching contributions to the Motorola Solutions 401(k) plan. Matching contributions were reinstated as of July 1, 2010 at a rate of 4% on the first 4% of employee contributions. The maximum matching contribution for 2010 was pro-rated to account for the number of months remaining after the reinstatement. The Company's expenses, primarily relating to the employer match, for all defined contribution plans, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $23 million, $8 million and $49 million, respectively.
 
All share and per share information presented gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on January 4, 2011. The Company also completed the Distribution of Motorola Mobility on January 4, 2011, however, the share and per share information presented does not reflect the Distribution of Motorola Mobility.
Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company grants options to acquire shares of common stock to certain employees, and existing option holders in connection with the merging of option plans following an acquisition. Each option granted and stock appreciation right has an exercise price of no less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The awards have a contractual life of five to ten years and vest over two to four years. Stock options and stock appreciation rights assumed or replaced with comparable stock options or stock appreciation rights in conjunction with a change in control only become exercisable if the holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or resigns for good reason within 24 months of a change in control.
The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible compensation on an after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than $25,000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee pays per share is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company's stock on the close of the first trading day or last trading day of the purchase period. The plan has two purchase periods, the first one from October 1 through March 31 and the second one from April 1 through September 30. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, employees purchased 2.7 million, 4.2 million and 2.7 million shares, respectively, at purchase prices of $41.79 and $42.00, $25.20 and $25.76, and $55.37 and $42.49, respectively.
The Company calculates the value of each employee stock option, estimated on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $21.43, $19.43 and $24.30, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
The Company uses the implied volatility for traded options on the Company's stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the Company's stock and the Company's assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.
The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the year for U.S. treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's future expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period for all option tranches.
 
The Company has applied forfeiture rates, estimated based on historical data, of 13%-50% to the option fair values calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These estimated forfeiture rates are applied to grants based on their remaining vesting term and may be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates.
Stock option activity was as follows (in thousands, except exercise price and employee data):
 
At December 31, 2010, the Company had $100 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock option plans and the employee stock purchase plan that will be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately two years. Cash received from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan was $179 million, $116 million and $145 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $17 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2010 was $213 million and $111 million, respectively, based on a December 31, 2010 stock price of $63.49 per share. Pursuant to the completion of the Distribution on January 4, 2011, approximately 8.0 million stock options held by the employees of Motorola Mobility were cancelled. Upon the completed divestiture of the Networks business on April 29, 2011, approximately 0.2 million stock options were cancelled.
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 6.6 million shares and 8.6 million shares, respectively, were available for future share-based award grants under the current share-based compensation plan, covering all equity awards to employees and non-employee directors.
The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2010 (in thousands, except exercise price and years):
 
As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average contractual life for options outstanding and exercisable was six and five years, respectively.
Stock Option Exchange
On May 14, 2009, the Company initiated a tender offer for certain eligible employees (excluding executive officers and directors) to exchange certain out-of-the-money options for new options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock as of the grant date. In order to be eligible for the exchange, the options had to have been granted prior to June 1, 2007, expire after December 31, 2009 and have an exercise price equal to or greater than $84.00. The offering period closed on June 12, 2009. On that date, 14 million options were tendered and exchanged for 6 million new options with an exercise price of
 
$47.11 and a ratable annual vesting period over two years. The exchange program was designed so that the fair market value of the new options would approximate the fair market value of the options exchanged. The resulting incremental compensation expense was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock ("RS") and restricted stock unit ("RSU") grants consist of shares or the rights to shares of the Company's common stock which are awarded to employees and non-employee directors. The grants are restricted such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the employee. Shares of RS and RSUs assumed or replaced with comparable shares of RS or RSUs in conjunction with a change in control will only have the restrictions lapse if the holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or resigns for good reason within 24 months of a change in control.
Restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity was as follows (in thousands, except fair value and employee data):
 
At December 31, 2010, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs of $301 million, net of estimated forfeitures, expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately two years. The total fair value of RS and RSU shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $114 million, $44 million and $19 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of outstanding RSUs as of December 31, 2010 was $607 million. Pursuant to the completion of the Distribution on January 4, 2011, approximately 3.8 million unvested restricted stock units held by the employees of Motorola Mobility were cancelled. Upon the completed divestiture of the Networks business on April 29, 2011, approximately 1.4 million unvested restricted stock units were cancelled.
Total Share-Based Compensation Expense
Compensation expense for the Company's employee stock options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock purchase plans, RS and RSUs was as follows:
 
Motorola Solutions Incentive Plan
Our incentive plan provides eligible employees with an annual payment, calculated as a percentage of an employee's eligible earnings, in the year after the close of the current calendar year if specified business goals and individual performance targets are met. The expense for awards under these incentive plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $201 million, $109 million and $106 million, respectively.
 
Long-Range Incentive Plan
The Long-Range Incentive Plan ("LRIP") rewards participating elected officers for the Company's achievement of specified business goals during the period, based on two performance objectives measured over three-year cycles. The expense for LRIP (net of the reversals of previously recognized reserves) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million, $5 million and $(9) million, respectively.
 
The Company holds certain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which must be measured using the fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies. The guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about current market conditions. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows:
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 1
Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.
Level 2
Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Level 3
The fair values of the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:
 
 
 
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of our Level 3 assets:
 
Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan Assets
The fair value of the various pension and postretirement health care benefits plans' assets by level in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010 were as follows:
Regular Plan
 
The table above includes securities on loan as part of a securities lending arrangement of $92 million of common stock and equivalents, $41 million of U.S. government and agency obligations and $34 million of corporate bonds. All securities on loan are fully cash collateralized.
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Regular Plan assets measured using Level 3 inputs:
 
Officers' Plan
 
 
Non-U.S. Plans
 
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Non-U.S. pension plan assets measured using Level 3 inputs:
 
Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan
 
The table above includes securities on loan as part of a securities lending arrangement of $4 million of common stock and equivalents, $2 million of U.S. government and agency obligations and $1 million of corporate bonds. All securities on loan are fully cash collateralized.
Valuation Methodologies
Quoted market prices in active markets are available for investments in common and preferred stock and common stock equivalents. As such, these investments are classified within Level 1.
Level 1
The securities classified as Level 2 are comprised primarily of corporate, government, agency and government-sponsored enterprise bonds. The Company primarily relies on valuation pricing models, recent bid prices, and broker quotes to determine the fair value of these securities. The valuation models for Level 2 assets are developed and maintained by third party pricing services and use a number of standard inputs to the valuation model including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes where the party is standing ready and able to transact, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data. The valuation model may prioritize these inputs differently at each balance sheet date for any given security, based on the market conditions. Not all of the standard inputs listed will be used each time in the valuation models. For each asset class, quantifiable inputs related to perceived market movements and sector news may be considered in addition to the standard inputs.
Level 2
 
In determining the fair value of the Company's foreign currency derivatives, the Company uses forward contract and option valuation models employing market observable inputs, such as spot currency rates, time value and option volatilities. Since the Company primarily uses observable inputs in its valuation of its derivative assets and liabilities, they are classified as Level 2 assets.
Fixed income securities are debt securities that do not have actively traded quotes as of the financial statement date. Determining the fair value of these securities requires the use of unobservable inputs, such as indicative quotes from dealers, extrapolated data, proprietary models and qualitative input from investment advisors. As such, these securities are classified within Level 3.
Level 3
At December 31, 2010, the Company has $1.0 billion of investments in money market mutual funds classified as Cash and cash equivalents in its consolidated balance sheet. The money market funds have quoted market prices that are generally equivalent to par.
 
Long-term Customer Financing
Long-term receivables consist of trade receivables with payment terms greater than twelve months, long-term loans and lease receivables under sales-type leases. Long-term receivables consist of the following:
 
The current portion of long-term receivables is included in Accounts receivable and the non-current portion of long-term receivables is included in Other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest income recognized on long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $14 million, $2 million and $3 million, respectively.
Certain purchasers of the Company's infrastructure equipment may request that the Company provide long-term financing (defined as financing with a term of greater than one year) in connection with the sale of equipment. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the equipment. The Company's obligation to provide long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from the Company. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $333 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $406 million at December 31, 2009 (including $168 million and $321 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, relating to discontinued operations). Of these amounts, $27 million was supported by letters of credit or by bank commitments to purchase long-term receivables at December 31, 2010, compared to $13 million supported at December 31, 2009 (including $25 million at December 31, 2010 and no amounts at December 31, 2009, relating to the Networks business). The majority of the outstanding commitments at December 31, 2010 are to a small number of network operators in the Middle East region. The Company retains the funded portion of the financing arrangements related to the Networks business following the sale to NSN, which totaled approximately $235 million at December 31, 2010.
In addition to providing direct financing to certain equipment customers, the Company also assists customers in obtaining financing directly from banks and other sources to fund equipment purchases. The Company had committed to provide financial guarantees relating to customer financing totaling $10 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009 (including $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables). Customer financing guarantees outstanding were $1 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $2 million at December 31, 2009 (including de minimus amounts at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relating to the sale of short-term receivables).
Sales of Receivables
From time to time, the Company sells accounts receivable and long-term receivables on a non-recourse basis to third parties under one-time arrangement while others are sold to third parties under committed facilities that involve contractual commitments from these parties to purchase qualifying receivables up to an outstanding monetary limit. Committed facilities may be revolving in nature and, typically, must be renewed annually. The Company may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term receivables.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a $200 million revolving receivable sales facility, maturing June 2011, for the sale of accounts receivable, which was fully available. The initial cash proceeds received by the Company for the sale of these receivables is capped at the lower of $200 million or eligible receivables less reserves. At December 31, 2009, the Company had a $200 million
 
committed revolving credit facility for the sale of accounts receivable, of which $140 million was available. The Company had no significant committed facilities for the sale of long-term receivables at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The following table summarizes the proceeds received from non-recourse sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
 
At December 31, 2010, the Company retained servicing obligations for $329 million of sold accounts receivables and $277 million of long-term receivables, compared to $141 million of accounts receivables and $297 million of long-term receivables at December 31, 2009.
Under certain arrangements, the value of accounts receivable sold is supported by credit insurance purchased from third-party insurance companies, less deductibles or self-insurance requirements under the insurance policies. Under these arrangements, the Company's total credit exposure, less insurance coverage, to outstanding accounts receivable that have been sold was de minimus at both at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
Credit Quality of Customer Financing Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
An aging analysis of financing receivables at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is as follows:
 
 
The Company uses an internally developed credit risk rating system for establishing customer credit limits. This system is aligned and comparable to the rating systems utilized by independent rating agencies.
The Company policy for valuing the allowance for credit losses is on an individual review basis. All customer financing receivables with past due balances greater than 90 days are reviewed for collectibility. The value of impairment is calculated based on the net present value of anticipated future cash streams from the customer. At December 31, 2010, there were a de minimus number of loans and leases which were impaired with an allowance for credit loss totaling $1 million, compared to an allowance for credit loss of $7 million at December 31, 2009.
 
Legal
 The Company was named as one of several defendants in putative class action securities lawsuits arising out of alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding the Iridium satellite communications business which, on March 15, 2001, were consolidated in the federal district court in the District of Columbia under originally filed on April 22, 1999. In April 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle, subject to court approval, to settle all claims against Motorola in exchange for Motorola's payment of $20 million. During the three months ended March 29, 2008, the Company recorded a charge associated with this settlement. On October 23, 2008, the court granted final approval of the settlement and dismissed the claims with prejudice.
Iridium Program:
Freeland v. Iridium World Communications, Inc., et al.,
The Company was sued by the Official Committee of the Unsecured Creditors of Iridium (the "Committee") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Iridium Bankruptcy Court") on July 19, 2001. , plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, warranty and fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer and preferences, and sought in excess of $4 billion in damages. On May 20, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement in which Motorola is not required to pay anything, but released its administrative, priority and unsecured claims against the Iridium estate and withdrew its objection to the 2001 settlement between the unsecured creditors of the Iridium Debtors and the Iridium Debtors' pre-petition secured lenders. This settlement, and its approval by the Bankruptcy Court, extinguished Motorola's financial exposure and concluded Motorola's involvement in the Iridium bankruptcy proceedings.
In re Iridium Operating LLC, et al. v. Motorola
 The Company is a defendant in various other suits, claims and investigations that arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

 The Company owns most of its major facilities and leases certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, information technology and other equipment under principally non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense, net of sublease income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $123 million, $140 million, and $151 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, future minimum lease obligations, net of minimum sublease rentals, for the next five years and beyond are as follows: 2011$124 million; 2012$86 million; 2013$52 million; 2014$37 million; 2015$21 million; beyond$23 million.
Leases:
 The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of the Company's assets or businesses and require the Company to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from the settlement of these pending obligations. The total amount of indemnification under these types of provision was $135 million as of December 31, 2010. Subsequent to December 31, 2010 as a result of the divestiture of the Networks business, the total amount of indemnification was approximately $335 million. The Company had accrued $9 million as of December 31, 2010 for potential claims under these provisions.
Indemnifications:
In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements. However, there is an increasing risk in relation to patent indemnities given the current legal climate.
In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. Further, the Company's obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, and for amounts not in excess of the contract value, and, in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.
In addition, pursuant to the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with Motorola Mobility, Motorola Mobility agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities, and the Company agreed to indemnify Motorola Mobility for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts.
 During 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with another company to resolve certain intellectual property disputes between the two companies. As a result of the settlement agreement, the Company received $65 million in cash and was assigned certain patent properties. As a result of this agreement, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $39 million (and $55 million was allocated to discontinued operations) during the year ended December 31, 2010, related to the settlement of the outstanding litigation between the parties.
Intellectual Property Matters:
 
Following the Distribution, Motorola Solutions reports financial results for the following two segments:
 
 
Segment operating results are measured based on operating earnings adjusted, if necessary, for certain segment-specific items and corporate allocations. Identifiable assets (excluding intersegment receivables) are the Company's assets that are identified with classes of similar products or operations in each geographic region.

The Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), which permits the Company to offer eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service and employment grade level in the event that employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force or restructuring. The Company recognizes termination benefits based on
 
formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist of future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its accruals for employee separation and exit costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, the Company reverses accruals through the consolidated statements of operations where the original charges were recorded when it is determined they are no longer needed.
2010 Charges
During 2010, the Company continued to implement various productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs.

Goodwill
The following table displays a rollforward of the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010:
 
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company finalized its assessment of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 Limitations ("IRC Section 382") relating to the pre-acquisition tax loss carryforwards of its 2007 acquisitions. As a result of the IRC Section 382 studies, the Company recorded additional deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in goodwill, which is reflected in the adjustment line above.
The Company conducts its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company's segments, Government and Enterprise, were each tested as reporting units. The Company performs extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market-based approaches, in its goodwill assessment process. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and other assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rate, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts specific to each reporting unit. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company has weighted the valuation of its reporting units at 75% based on the income approach and 25% based on the market-based approach, consistent with prior periods. The Company believes that this weighting is appropriate since it is often difficult to find other appropriate market participants that are similar to our reporting units and it is the Company's view that future discounted cash flows are more reflective of the value of the reporting units.
Based on the results of the 2009 and 2010 annual assessments of the recoverability of goodwill, the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their book values, indicating that there was no impairment of goodwill.
In 2008, the fair value of the Enterprise reporting unit was below its respective book values, indicating a potential impairment of goodwill and the requirement to perform step two of the analysis for the reporting unit. The Company acquired the main components of the Enterprise reporting unit in 2007 at which time the book and fair value of the reporting unit was the same. Because of this fact,
 
the Enterprise reporting unit was most likely to experience a decline in its fair value below its book value as a result of lower values in the overall market due to the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and the market's view of its near term impact on the reporting unit. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company determined that the goodwill relating to the Enterprise reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a charge of $1.6 billion in the Enterprise segment.
