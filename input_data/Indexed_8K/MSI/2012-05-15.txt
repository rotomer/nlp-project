provided
however
(b) The Underwriters will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may
 
become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total gross proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts, commissions received by the Underwriters in connection with the Underwriter's resale of the Securities pursuant to the Prospectus.The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriters within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of the Underwriters; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

10. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining principal amount and scheduled payments of interest thereon (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Company's Prospectus Supplement dated May 8, 2012 to the Prospectus dated May 8, 2012 relating to the Notes) plus 30 basis points, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.

Exhibit 4.2
THIS NOTE IS A GLOBAL NOTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITARY. THIS NOTE IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR NOTES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE (OTHER THAN A TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY) MAY BE REGISTERED EXCEPTED IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Issuer (as defined below) or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer", which term includes any successor corporation under the Senior Indenture hereafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the Issuer may from time to time designate, the principal sum of             DOLLARS on May 15, 2022, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest, semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2012, on the original principal amount hereof at said office or agency, in like coin or currency, at the rate per annum specified in the title of this Note, from the May 15 or the November 15, as the case may be, next preceding the date of this Note to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, unless the date hereof is a date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, in which case from the date of this Note, or unless no interest has been paid on the Notes (as defined below) or duly provided for, in which case from May 15, 2012, until payment of the principal amount hereof has been made or duly provided for; provided, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Issuer by check mailed by first class mail to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after May 1 or November 1 as the case may be, and before the following May 15 or November 15, this Note shall bear interest from such May 15 or November 15; provided, that if the Issuer shall default in the payment of interest due on such May 15 or November 15, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding May 15 or November 15, to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes or duly provided for, from May 15, 2012. The interest so payable on any May 15 or November 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Senior Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such May 15 or November 15. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Senior Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Motorola Solutions, Inc. has caused this instrument to be signed by one of its duly authorized officers and has caused a facsimile of its corporate seal to be affixed hereunto or imprinted hereon.
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to a Senior Indenture dated as of May 1, 1995 (herein called the "Senior Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Senior Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any) and may otherwise vary as provided in the Senior Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as the 3.750% Senior Notes due May 15, 2022 (the "Notes") of the Issuer. The Notes are initially limited in aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000; provided, however, that the Issuer may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional notes ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise similar in all respects so that such further notes would be consolidated and form a single series of the Notes.
Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, this Note will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Note will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, and ownership of this Note shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
Optional Redemption
The Notes shall be redeemable at the option of the Issuer, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (each a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the Redemption Date, or (ii) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 0.30% (30 basis points). The redemption price shall be calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to the relevant Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record date according to their terms and the provisions of the Senior Indenture.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, or their respective successors, as may be appointed from time to time by the Issuer; provided, however, that if the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer shall substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and each of their respective successors (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Issuer. If any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Issuer will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon shall be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, the Issuer shall assume a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
 
Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on the notes, or portions thereof, called for redemption. On or before the Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date.
Change of Control
If a change of control repurchase event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above, the Issuer shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any change of control repurchase event or, at the option of the Issuer, prior to any change of control, but after the public announcement of the change of control, the Issuer shall mail a notice to each holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the change of control repurchase event and offering to repurchase the notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a change of control repurchase event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date. The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a change of control repurchase event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control repurchase event provisions of the Notes by virtue of compliance with such securities laws or regulations.
On the repurchase date following a change of control repurchase event, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
 
The paying agent shall promptly mail or otherwise deliver to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered.
The Issuer shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control repurchase event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.

"change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act) or group of related "persons" other than the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the adoption of a plan relating to the Issuer's liquidation or dissolution; (3) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as defined above) or group of related "persons" becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Issuer's stock or other voting stock into which the Issuer's voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Issuer are not continuing directors.

In determining whether the rating of the Notes has decreased by one or more gradations, gradations within rating categories (+ and - for S&P; 1, 2 and 3 for Moody's; or the equivalent gradations for another Rating Agency) shall be taken into account (e.g., with respect to S&P, a decline in a rating from BB+ to BB, as well as from BB- to B+, will constitute a decrease of one gradation).
"rating date" means the date which is 90 days prior to the earlier of (i) a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or of the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control.
"ratings event" means the occurrence of the events described in (a) or (b) below on, or within 60 days after the earlier of, (i) the occurrence of a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the intention by the Issuer to effect a change of control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies): (a) in the event the Notes are rated by both rating agencies on the rating date as investment grade, the rating of the Notes shall be reduced so that the Notes are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies, or (b) in the event the Notes (1) are rated investment grade by one rating agency and below investment grade by the other rating agency, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories) so that the Notes are then rated below investment grade by both rating agencies or (2) are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies on the rating date, the rating of the Notes by either rating agency shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories, as well as between rating categories) or is withdrawn. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a ratings event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus shall not be deemed a ratings event for purposes of the definition of change of control repurchase event hereunder) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
"voting stock" of any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
Events of Default
In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture.
Amendments
The Senior Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66

% in principal amount of the Securities of each series issued under such Senior Indenture then Outstanding and affected to add any provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of, such Senior Indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series so affected; provided that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, (i) extend the stated maturity of the principal of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or change the currency in which the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), premium, if any, or interest thereon is payable or reduce the amount of any original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in bankruptcy or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any Security when due or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of Securities of any series issued under such Senior Indenture, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such modification. It is also provided in the Senior Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities, or to the default under any covenant or provision of the Senior Indenture which under the terms of the Senior Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Senior Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
Payment
No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

Re: Motorola Solutions, Inc.  Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Motorola Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of (i) a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181223) (the "Registration Statement") relating to the offering from time to time, together or separately and in one or more series (if applicable), of an indeterminate amount of various securities of the Company, including senior notes, (ii) the prospectus dated May 8, 2012 forming a part thereof, together with the documents incorporated therein by reference, (iii) the preliminary prospectus supplement in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on May 8, 2012, and (iv) the final prospectus supplement dated May 8, 2012 in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on May 9, 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), in connection with the offering by the Company of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Securities").
In connection with this opinion, we have examined such corporate records, documents, instruments, certificates of public officials and of the Company and such questions of law as we have deemed necessary for the purpose of rendering the opinions set forth herein.
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all items submitted to us as originals and the conformity with originals of all items submitted to us as copies.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that the Securities constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in effect, and equitable principles that may limit the right to specific enforcement of remedies.
We express no opinion as to matters governed by laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws) and the federal laws of the United States of America, as in effect on the date hereof.
We hereby consent to your filing a copy of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on May 15, 2012, and we further consent to the use of our name under the heading of "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement filed by the Company with the Commission. In giving such permission, we do not admit hereby that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. We disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law.
