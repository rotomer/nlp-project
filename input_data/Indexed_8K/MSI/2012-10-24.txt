 Oct. 24, 2012  Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: MSI) announced today its third-quarter 2012 results highlighted by sales of $2.2 billion, up 3 percent from the third quarter of 2011 and driven by strong demand in its Government segment. These results include an unfavorable currency exchange rate impact to revenues of $42 million, or approximately 2 percent.
SCHAUMBURG, Ill.
"We had strong revenue and earnings growth, including record performance in our Government segment," said Greg Brown, chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions. "We expanded operating margins, managed our costs and grew earnings per share 27 percent driven by our operating performance and continued return of capital to shareholders."
GAAP operating earnings in the third quarter of 2012 were $324 million or 15 percent of sales, compared to $254 million or 12.2 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.72, compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of 2011.
Non-GAAP operating earnings in the third quarter of 2012 were $387 million or 18 percent of sales, compared to $359 million or 17.2 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.84, compared to $0.66 in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP financial information excludes after-tax expense of approximately $0.12 per diluted share related to share-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization expense and highlighted items. Details on these Non-GAAP adjustments and the use of Non-GAAP measures are included later in this press release.
During the third quarter of 2012, the company generated $182 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations, including the impact of an early pension payment of $72 million. Additionally, the company repurchased $308 million in shares, paid $63 million in dividends and ended the quarter with total cash*** of $3.5 billion.

Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2012 Outlook
The company expects fourth-quarter sales to grow approximately 6 to 7 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, with EPS from continuing operations of $0.98 to $1.03. The company is increasing its full-year 2012 outlook for sales growth to 6 to 6.5 percent to reflect revenues for Psion, which Motorola Solutions acquired on Oct. 1, 2012. Our EPS outlook excludes share-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization expense and charges associated with items of the variety typically highlighted by the company in its quarterly earnings releases.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included Non-GAAP measurements of results. We have provided these Non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand our core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to our competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The Non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of Non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the Non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these Non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items (and any reversals of highlighted items recorded in prior periods) from its Non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.
Highlighted items:
The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its Non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.
Share-based compensation expense:
The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its Non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements, primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company's acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company's revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company's future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.
Intangible assets amortization expense:
Details of the above items and reconciliations of the Non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.
