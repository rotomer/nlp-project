Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE:MTB) today reported that diluted cash earnings per share for 2002 rose 11% to $5.41 from $4.87 in 2001. Cash net income for 2002 was $518 million, up 7% from $482 million in 2001. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, cash net income was 1.68% in 2002, up from 1.63% in 2001. Cash return on average tangible common equity improved to 28.62% in 2002 from 28.50% in 2001. Cash earnings exclude the after-tax effect of nonrecurring merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets.
     Diluted cash earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $1.40, up 8% from $1.30 in the corresponding 2001 quarter. Cash net income for the recent quarter was $133 million, 5% higher than the $126 million earned in the year-earlier quarter. The annualized cash returns on average tangible assets and average tangible equity were 1.65% and 27.38%, respectively, in 2002's fourth quarter, compared with 1.67% and 29.43%, respectively, in the final quarter of 2001.
     M&T has provided supplemental reporting of its operating results on a "cash" or "tangible" basis (which excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and the related asset balances resulting from acquisition transactions) since 1998. Management believes that such reporting represents a relevant measure of financial performance.

M&T BANK CORPORATION
     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", M&T ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions, effective January 1, 2002. Amortization of such goodwill during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2001, none of which was tax deductible, totaled $16 million ($.16 per diluted share) and $62 million ($.62 per diluted share), respectively. Charges for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets totaled $12 million ($7 million after tax effect, or $.07 per diluted share) during the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with $14 million ($9 million after tax effect, or $.09 per diluted share) during the year-earlier quarter. Similar amortization charges for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $51 million ($32 million after tax effect, or $.34 per diluted share) and $60 million ($38 million after tax effect, or $.38 per diluted share), respectively. M&T had recorded as assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001 goodwill of $1.1 billion, while core deposit and other intangible assets totaled $119 million and $170 million at those respective dates.
     Net income measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") includes the impact of non-cash charges for amortization of intangible assets, as well as nonrecurring merger-related expenses. GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share for 2002 rose 33% to $5.07 from $3.82 in 2001. On the same basis, net income for 2002 increased 28% to $485 million from $378 million in the prior year. Pro forma GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share and net income for 2001, computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective on January 1, 2001, were $4.44 and $440 million, respectively. GAAP-basis net income for 2002 expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.52% and 16.15%, respectively, up from 1.23% and 12.78%,
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
respectively, for 2001. Pro forma GAAP-basis returns on average assets and average common stockholders' equity for 2001 were 1.43% and 14.87%, respectively, after excluding the impact of goodwill amortization. The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses incurred in 2001 was $5 million ($.05 per diluted share). There were no significant merger-related expenses in 2002.
     For 2002's fourth quarter, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share and net income were $1.33 and $126 million, respectively, improved from $1.05 and $102 million, respectively, in the final quarter of 2001. As already noted, the after-tax impact of amortization of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $16 million, or $.16 per diluted share, resulting in pro forma GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share and net income for last year's fourth quarter, calculated as if SFAS No. 142 had been in effect during 2001, of $1.21 and $117 million, respectively. The annualized returns on average assets and average common equity for the fourth quarter of 2002 were 1.51% and 16.05%, respectively, compared with 1.29% and 13.70%, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter. Pro forma GAAP-basis annualized returns on average assets and average common stockholders' equity for the final 2001 quarter were 1.49% and 15.79%, respectively, after excluding the impact of goodwill amortization. There were no significant merger-related expenses during the fourth quarters of 2002 or 2001.
     Robert G. Wilmers, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of M&T, commented "Continued weakness in general economic conditions resulted in an extremely challenging year for M&T. However, certain positive factors allowed M&T to report an increase in cash net income for 2002. Particularly encouraging were the growth experienced in our consumer loan portfolio, predominantly home equity lines of credit and automobile loans, and a strong net interest margin."

     A summary of net income and diluted earnings per share, pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share (computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective in 2001) and cash net income and diluted cash earnings per share follows:
(1)  After any related tax effect
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 7% to $1.26 billion in 2002 from $1.18 billion in 2001. A widening of M&T's net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, and higher average loans outstanding were the leading factors in the improvement. Net interest margin improved by 13 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.36% in 2002 from 4.23% in 2001. Average loans outstanding in 2002 were $25.5 billion, up 4% from
 
5-5-5-5-5 M&T BANK CORPORATION
$24.4 billion a year earlier. Growth in consumer loans of $1.2 billion, or 21%, was partially offset by lower levels of residential real estate and commercial loans. Average loans outstanding totaled $25.9 billion in 2002's fourth quarter when the annualized net interest margin was 4.28%, compared with $25.0 billion of average loans outstanding and a 4.34% annualized net interest margin in the year-earlier quarter. During November 2002, approximately $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans were securitized. Eighty-eight percent of these mortgage-backed securities were retained in M&T's investment securities portfolio. A $5 million gain was realized from the sale of the twelve percent portion and has been included in other noninterest income.
     The provision for credit losses increased to $122 million in 2002 from $104 million in 2001. Net charge-offs of loans during the recent year totaled $108 million or .42% of average loans outstanding, compared with $75 million or ..31% of average loans in 2001. Net charge-offs were $31 million during the fourth quarter of 2002, or an annualized .48% of average loans outstanding, compared with $21 million or .33% during the final quarter of 2001. Nonperforming loans were $201 million at December 31, 2002, or .78% of total loans, compared with $190 million or .76% a year earlier. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $168 million at the recent year-end, compared with $147 million at December 31, 2001. Included in these loans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $123 million and $108 million, respectively, of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by M&T and repurchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. The outstanding principal balances of these loans, which were repurchased to reduce loan servicing costs, are fully guaranteed by government agencies. The remaining portion of accruing loans past due 90 days or more are either also guaranteed by government agencies or well-secured by collateral.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     M&T's allowance for credit losses totaled $436 million, representing 1.70% of total loans, at December 31, 2002, compared with $425 million or 1.69% a year earlier. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 217% at the recent year-end, compared with 223% a year earlier. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $17 million and $16 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
     Noninterest income rose 7% to $512 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $477 million in 2001. Similarly, noninterest income of $138 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 was up 8% from $128 million during the corresponding 2001 quarter. Higher revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services significantly contributed to both increases. Noninterest operating expenses, which exclude amortization of intangible assets and nonrecurring merger-related expenses, were $870 million in 2002, compared with $819 million in 2001. A provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $32 million and higher costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation, largely contributed to the higher level of operating expenses. The impairment charge reflects the impact on customer refinancings that the current low interest rate environment is expected to have on residential mortgage prepayment speeds. There was no similar impairment charge in 2001. Noninterest operating expenses totaled $229 million during 2002's final quarter, up 7% from $215 million in the year-earlier period. Reflecting the lowest residential mortgage interest rates in over 40 years, M&T recognized a $13 million impairment in the carrying value of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights during the recently completed quarter.
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio, calculated using the operating expense totals noted above and excluding gains (losses) from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income, was 49.0% in 2002, improved from 49.6% in 2001.
     At December 31, 2002, M&T had total assets of $33.2 billion, up from $31.5 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, increased 2% to $25.7 billion at the 2002 year-end from $25.2 billion at December 31, 2001. Year-over-year growth of the loan portfolio was muted by the previously mentioned $1.1 billion residential real estate loan securitization in November 2002. Deposits were $21.7 billion and $21.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total stockholders' equity was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2002, representing 9.59% of total assets, compared with $2.9 billion or 9.35% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $34.53 and $31.33 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $21.75 at the recent year-end and $18.34 at December 31, 2001.
     In September 2002, M&T announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. ("AIB"), Dublin, Ireland, to acquire Allfirst Financial Inc. ("Allfirst"), Baltimore, Maryland, and to merge it into M&T. The merger has been approved by the shareholders of AIB and M&T, but still must be approved by various regulatory agencies. Assuming the timely receipt of such approvals, the merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2003.
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     In September 2002, M&T announced that it will begin expensing the fair value of stock-based compensation effective January 1, 2003. As allowed under GAAP, M&T has historically not recognized compensation expense for employee stock options, although the impact on net income and diluted earnings per share of expensing the fair value of stock options has been disclosed for all years since 1995. Beginning in 2003, M&T will recognize stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value-based method of accounting described in SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended. M&T expects to implement the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which is an amendment to SFAS No. 123 adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in December 2002. Assuming the number of stock options issued in 2003 will be similar to those issued in 2002, M&T estimates that stock-based compensation expense for 2003 will be $33 million (after tax effect). Similar expense that will be recognized for 2002 using the retroactive restatement method is $28 million (after tax effect).
     In November 2001, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to repurchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through September 2002, M&T had repurchased 3,632,098 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $78.49 per share. M&T has discontinued purchases of its common stock, instead using the Company's internal generation of capital to support the pending acquisition of Allfirst.
     With a view toward 2003, Michael P. Pinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of M&T, noted "We look forward to meeting 2003's challenges, including the successful merger and integration of Allfirst into M&T. We estimate that,
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
excluding the effect of the Allfirst transaction, GAAP earnings per share in 2003 will be in the $5.25 to $5.35 range, after absorbing the estimated impact of expensing stock-based compensation. However, given the uncertain economic outlook that we presently face, this estimate remains subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances that may occur during the year."
