EXHIBIT 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T") (NYSE: MTB) today reported diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the first quarter of 2003 of $1.23, up 4% from $1.18 in the year-earlier period. GAAP-basis net income for the recent quarter was $117 million, 3% higher than $114 million in the corresponding quarter of 2002. GAAP-basis net income for the initial 2003 quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.43% and 14.46%, respectively, compared with 1.47% and 15.56%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2002.
     Effective January 1, 2003, M&T began expensing the fair value of stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value method of accounting described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in the initial 2003 quarter included $10 million of stock-based compensation, resulting in a reduction of net income of $7 million, or $.08 per diluted share. Using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, salaries and employee benefits expense for the first quarter of 2002 was restated to include $10 million of stock-based compensation, resulting in a reduction of previously reported net income of $7 million, or $.07 per diluted share.
     Diluted cash earnings per share for the first quarter of 2003 were $1.34, 6% higher than $1.27 in the year-earlier quarter.

Cash net income for the recent quarter was $127 million, up 4% from $122 million in the corresponding 2002 quarter. Cash net income in 2003's initial quarter represented an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity of 1.62% and 24.68%, respectively, compared with 1.65% and 28.41%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2002. As has been M&T's consistent practice since 1998, reported cash earnings exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after related tax effect, was $7 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the recent quarter, compared with $9 million ($.09 per diluted share) in the similar quarter of 2002. Merger-related expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2003 associated with the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. ("Allfirst") were, after related tax effect, $4 million or $.04 per diluted share. Such amount represents the after-tax effect of costs for professional services, travel and other expenses associated with planning for the acquisition and the related integration of data processing and other operating systems and functions. M&T will incur additional merger-related expenses in future quarters as Allfirst's operations are integrated into M&T. There were no merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2002.

     A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share with cash net income and diluted cash earnings per share follows:
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 5% to $320 million in the recently completed quarter from $305 million in 2002's first quarter. The improvement reflects a $1.7 billion, or 6%, increase in average earning assets. Average loans and leases outstanding during the initial 2003 quarter were $25.8 billion, up 3% from $25.1 billion in the corresponding 2002 quarter. Average investment securities totaled $3.6 billion during the first quarter of 2003, up 25% from $2.9 billion in the corresponding 2002 quarter, due largely to the impact of the securitization of $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans in November 2002. Approximately 88% of the mortgage-backed securities resulting from the securitization were retained in M&T's investment securities portfolio. Net interest margin declined 5 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.32% in the first quarter of 2003 from 4.37% in the year-earlier quarter.

     The provision for credit losses was $33 million in the recent quarter, up from $24 million in the initial 2002 quarter. Net charge-offs of loans totaled $25 million during the first quarter of 2003, compared with $16 million a year earlier. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .39% in the recent quarter and .26% in the corresponding quarter of 2002. Nonperforming loans totaled $230 million or .88% of total loans at March 31, 2003, up from $182 million or .73% a year earlier. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $146 million at the recent quarter-end, compared with $148 million in 2002's initial quarter. Included in these loans at March 31, 2003 and 2002 were $120 million and $109 million, respectively, of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by M&T and repurchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. The outstanding principal balances of these loans, which were repurchased to reduce servicing costs, are fully guaranteed by government agencies. In general, the remaining portion of accruing loans past due 90 days or more are either also guaranteed by government agencies or well-secured by collateral.
     M&T's allowance for credit losses totaled $445 million, or 1.70% of total loans at March 31, 2003, compared with $433 million, or 1.72% a year earlier. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 193% at the recent quarter-end, compared with 238% at March 31, 2002. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $17 million and $22 million at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     Noninterest income in the recent quarter totaled $133 million, up 7% from $124 million in the first quarter of 2002. Higher revenues from mortgage banking and deposit account
 
5-5-5-5-5 M&T BANK CORPORATION
services contributed to the year-over-year increase. Noninterest operating expenses, which exclude the previously mentioned merger-related expenses and amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, but include expenses attributable to stock-based compensation, were $225 million in the first quarter of 2003 and $220 million in the corresponding 2002 period.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio, calculated using the noninterest operating expense totals noted above and excluding gains from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income, was 49.8% in the first quarter of 2003, improved from 51.3% in 2002's first quarter.
     Michael P. Pinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of M&T observed, "The weakened economy continued to present a challenging environment in which to operate. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the operating results of our mortgage banking business and continued strong growth in our consumer loan portfolio, although those positive factors were offset by generally lackluster revenue growth in other business lines. Excluding the effects of Allfirst and assuming that the economy begins to rebound later this quarter, we remain comfortable with our previously stated belief that M&T's full-year results will be within the range of $5.25 to $5.35 of diluted earnings per share. Of course, this estimate is subject to the possible adverse impact of future economic and political conditions. Moreover, we are excited to welcome our colleagues from Allfirst to the M&T family, and we believe that our combined company will be one of the premier financial institutions in the country."

Deposits were $21.9 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $21.6 billion a year earlier.

Common stockholders' equity per share was $35.81 at the recent quarter-end, up from $31.89 at March 31, 2002.
