Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for 2003.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for 2003 were $4.95, up 4% from $4.78 in 2002. On the same basis, net income for 2003 totaled $574 million, 26% higher than the $457 million earned in 2002. GAAP-basis net income for 2003 expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.27% and 11.62%, respectively, compared with 1.43% and 15.09%, respectively, in 2002.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     M&T's financial results for 2003 reflect the impact of operations obtained in the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. ("Allfirst") and the related issuance by M&T of 26.7 million common shares on that date. Merger-related expenses in 2003 were $39 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.34 per diluted share. Such expenses represent costs for professional services, travel, and other expenses associated with the acquisition, the related integration of data processing and other operating systems and functions with those of M&T, and the commencement of M&T operations in market areas formerly served by Allfirst. There were no similar expenses in 2002.
     GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 rose 8% to $1.35 from $1.25 in the similar 2002 period. On the same basis, net income for the recently completed quarter
 
2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION
totaled $167 million, 41% higher than $119 million in the final quarter of 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2003, M&T incurred merger-related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition totaling $2 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.01 per diluted share. M&T does not expect to incur any significant additional merger-related expenses relating to the Allfirst transaction. GAAP-basis net income for 2003's final quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.35% and 11.77%, respectively, compared with 1.42% and 15.00%, respectively, in the corresponding 2002 period.
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $13 million ($.11 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $7 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the year-earlier quarter. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $48 million ($.41 per diluted share) and $32 million ($.34 per diluted share), respectively.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the previously noted merger-related expenses, were $5.70 for 2003, up 11% from $5.12 in 2002. Net operating income for 2003 was $661 million, 35% above $489 million for 2002. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.55% and 28.49%, respectively, in 2003, compared with 1.59% and 26.71% in 2002.
     For the final quarter of 2003, diluted net operating earnings per share were $1.47, up 11% from $1.32 in the comparable 2002 period. Net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2003 rose to $182 million, 44% higher than $126 million in the corresponding 2002 period. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2003, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.57% and 28.33%, respectively, compared with 1.56% and 25.54% in the year-earlier period.
     Robert G. Wilmers, M&T's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The planning for and execution of the Allfirst merger was clearly M&T's most significant event in 2003. While the ultimate success of this merger will be measured over several years, we are very pleased with the results experienced to date, both financially and in the integration of Allfirst's operations with those of M&T."

      Effective January 1, 2003, M&T began expensing stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value method of accounting described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2003 included $43 million of stock-based compensation, including $12 million in the recent quarter. After tax effect, stock-based compensation lowered 2003's net income by $32 million ($.27 per diluted share). Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was lowered by $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) as a result of stock-based compensation. Using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, salaries and employee benefits expense for 2002 was restated to include $41 million of stock-based compensation, resulting in a reduction of previously reported net income of $28 million, or $.29 per diluted share.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
Stock-based compensation expense reflected in M&T's results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $10 million (pre-tax), or $7 million and $.08 per diluted share after applicable income tax effect. Stock-based compensation expenses are reflected in both the GAAP and supplemental non-GAAP results of operations discussed herein.
      Growth in average loans outstanding resulted in a rise in taxable-equivalent net interest income of 28% to $1.62 billion in 2003 from $1.26 billion in 2002. Including the impact of the $10.3 billion of loans obtained in the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst, average loans outstanding increased 33% to $34.0 billion in 2003 from $25.5 billion in 2002. Net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, declined to 4.09% in 2003 from 4.36% in the year-earlier period. The decrease in net interest margin was largely the result of the yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities obtained in the Allfirst acquisition.
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
     During the fourth quarter of 2003, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $425 million, average loans outstanding totaled $36.4 billion and the annualized net interest margin was 3.96%. In 2002's final quarter, which did not include any Allfirst-related amounts, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $325 million, average loans outstanding were $25.9 billion, and the net interest margin was 4.28%. Average loan balances in 2003 and 2002 reflect fourth quarter transactions in each year in which M&T converted residential real estate loans of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, into mortgage-backed securities.
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      The provision for credit losses was $131 million in 2003, up from $122 million in 2002. Net charge-offs of loans during the recent year totaled $97 million, or .28% of average loans outstanding, compared with $108 million or .42% of average loans in 2002. The provision for credit losses was $28 million and $33 million during the final quarter of 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net charge-offs were $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, or an annualized .35% of average loans outstanding, compared with $31 million or .48% during 2002's final quarter. Net charge-offs of loans acquired from Allfirst during 2003 were not significant.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $240 million, or .67% of total loans at December 31, 2003, compared with $215 million or .84% a year earlier. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $155 million at the recent year-end, little changed from $154 million a year earlier. Included in the past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $125 million and $129 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Nonperforming loans and loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest at December 31, 2003 included loans obtained in the Allfirst acquisition of $67 million and $17 million, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $20 million at December 31, 2003, compared with $17 million at December 31, 2002.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $614 million, or 1.72% of total loans, at December 31, 2003, compared with $436 million, or 1.70%, a year earlier. On the April 1, 2003 acquisition date, Allfirst had an allowance for credit losses of $146 million, or 1.43% of Allfirst's loans then outstanding. Immediately following the April 1 merger, the combined balance sheet of M&T and Allfirst included an allowance
Allowance for Credit Losses.
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
for credit losses of $591 million that was equal to 1.62% of the $36.5 billion of then outstanding loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 256% and 203% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
      Noninterest income in 2003 grew to $831 million, 62% higher than $512 million in 2002. Approximately $279 million of the increase was attributable to revenues related to operations in market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the improvement. As a result of Allfirst-related revenues, noninterest income of $234 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 was up 69% from $138 million in the corresponding quarter of 2002.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in 2003 totaled $1.45 billion, 51% higher than $962 million in 2002. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be "nonoperating" in nature, consisting of the previously noted amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $78 million in 2003 and $51 million in 2002, and merger-related expenses of $60 million in 2003. There were no merger-related expenses in 2002. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.31 billion in 2003, compared with $910 million in 2002. The increase in operating expenses was largely related to operations formerly associated with Allfirst. Partially offsetting these higher expenses were lower charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Such charges totaled $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. The impairment charges resulted from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflect the impact of changing interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
prepayments. Capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, net of an impairment valuation allowance, are included in "other assets" in M&T's consolidated balance sheet and totaled $129 million and $103 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled approximately $13 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002.
     Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $378 million, compared with $251 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $21 million in 2003 and $12 million in 2002, and merger-related expenses of $3 million in 2003. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $354 million in the recently completely quarter, compared with $239 million in the final quarter of 2002. The increase in operating expenses was largely related to operations formerly related to Allfirst. Changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights also affected M&T's expenses in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002. Those expenses in the fourth quarter of 2003 reflect a $4 million reduction in total expenses resulting from a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, while a $13 million increase in the valuation allowance in 2002's fourth quarter added to total expenses.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 53.6% in 2003, compared with 51.3% in 2002. During 2003's fourth quarter, M&T's efficiency ratio was 53.9%, compared with 51.7% in the year-earlier
 
10-10-10-10-10 M&T BANK CORPORATION
quarter. The higher ratios in 2003 reflect the impact of the acquired Allfirst operations that are now a part of M&T.
      M&T's total assets rose 50% to $49.8 billion at December 31, 2003 from $33.2 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $35.8 billion at the 2003 year-end, up 39% from $25.7 billion at December 31, 2002. Deposits increased to $33.1 billion at December 31, 2003 from $21.7 billion at the end of 2002. Total assets, loans and deposits obtained in the Allfirst transaction were $16 billion, $10 billion and $11 billion, respectively. Total stockholders' equity was $5.7 billion at December 31, 2003, representing 11.47% of total assets, compared with $3.2 billion or 9.66% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $47.55 and $34.82 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $21.97 at December 31, 2003, compared with $22.04 at December 31, 2002. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Balance Sheet.
     Looking forward to 2004, Michael P. Pinto, M&T's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, noted, "We expect that the economy and the overall business environment in 2004 will present many challenges for regional banks and other financial institutions. M&T will, of course, not be immune to these challenges. Subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances that may occur throughout this year, our present estimate of GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share for 2004 is in the range of $5.90 to $6.10."
