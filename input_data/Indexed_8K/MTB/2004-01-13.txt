     On January 13, 2004, M&T Bank Corporation sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them of a blackout period in the M&T Bank Corporation Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the "RSP") beginning on February 10, 2004, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and ending during the week of March 14, 2004 (the "Blackout Period") that will temporarily prevent participants in the RSP from engaging in transactions in M&T Bank Corporation common stock in their individual accounts. During the Blackout Period, participants in the RSP generally will be unable to direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts, obtain loans from the RSP or obtain a distribution from the RSP.
     The reason for the Blackout Period is to complete the transition of the recordkeeping and administrative services to T. Rowe Price, who will become the new trustee and recordkeeper for the RSP beginning on March 1, 2004, to eliminate certain existing investment options and to add several new investment options, and to merge the Allfirst Financial Inc. Capital Accumulation Retirement Plan and Trust into the RSP.
     Inquiries concerning the Blackout Period should be directed to Norbert H. Remus, One M&T Plaza, Buffalo, NY 14203, telephone number (716) 842-5002. During the week of March 14, 2004, directors and executive officers of M&T Bank Corporation will be able to contact T. Rowe Price at (800) 922-9945 to determine when the Blackout Period has ended.
     A copy of the notice transmitted to the directors and executive officers of M&T Bank Corporation is set forth in Exhibit 99 hereto and is incorporated by reference into this Item.
     M&T Bank Corporation received the notice required by section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on January 9, 2004.
