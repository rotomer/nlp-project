Exhibit 99 CONTACT: Michael S. Piemonte FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: (716) 842-5138 July 12, 2004 M&T BANK CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS BUFFALO, NEW YORK -- M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. GAAP Results of Operations. Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the second quarter of 2004 were $1.53, up 39% from $1.10 in the year-earlier period. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter totaled $184 million, 38% higher than $134 million in the second quarter of 2003. GAAP-basis net income for the second quarter of 2004 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.45% and 13.12%, respectively, up from 1.10% and 10.00%, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter. M&T's results for the recently completed quarter reflect the impact of a partial reversal of a valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $22 million. After applicable income tax effect, such reversal added $13 million to net income, or $.11 per diluted share. The reduction of the valuation allowance reflects the increase in the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights resulting from higher residential mortgage loan interest rates at the recent quarter-end as compared with March 31, 2004. M&T had recognized a provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights in the second quarter of 2003 of $18 million that after applicable income tax effect reduced that quarter's net income by $11 million, or $.09 per diluted share. The 2003 impairment charge reflected the impact of -more-
2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION declining interest rates during last year's second quarter on the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights. M&T's results for 2003's second quarter also reflect merger-related expenses incurred in connection with the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. ("Allfirst"). Such expenses totaled $22 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.17 per diluted share, and represented costs for professional services, travel, and other expenses associated with the acquisition and the related integration of data processing and other operating systems and functions. There were no similar expenses in the second quarter of 2004. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $2.83 from $2.30 in the similar 2003 period. On the same basis, net income for the first half of 2004 totaled $344 million, 37% higher than $251 million in the year-earlier period. Merger-related expenses incurred during the first two quarters of 2003 associated with the acquisition of Allfirst were $25 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.23 per diluted share. There were no merger-related expenses in the first six months of 2004. GAAP-basis net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.37% and 12.15%, respectively, compared with 1.23% and 11.67%, respectively, in the corresponding 2003 period. Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net -more-
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $12 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the recent quarter, compared with $14 million ($.11 per diluted share) in the year-earlier quarter. Similar after tax effect amortization charges for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 were $25 million ($.20 per diluted share) and $21 million ($.20 per diluted share), respectively. Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.63 in the second quarter of 2004, 18% higher than $1.38 in the corresponding quarter of 2003. Net operating income during the recent quarter was $196 million, up 16% from $169 million in the year-earlier quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.64% and 30.12%, respectively, in 2004's second quarter, improved from 1.48% and 29.89% in the second quarter of 2003. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, diluted net operating earnings per share were $3.03, up 11% from $2.73 in the corresponding 2003 period. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 rose 24% to $369 million from $297 million in the corresponding 2003 period. For the first six months of 2004, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on -more-

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results of Operations. A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share and net income with diluted net operating earnings per share and net operating income follows: (1) After any related tax effect -more-
5-5-5-5-5 M&T BANK CORPORATION Reconciliation of Total Assets and Equity to Tangible Assets and Equity. A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity follows: Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income. As a result of growth in average earning assets, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $438 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $435 million in the year-earlier quarter. Average earning assets totaled $44.9 billion in the recent quarter, compared with $42.4 billion in the second quarter of 2003. Largely offsetting the favorable impact of higher earning assets was a narrowing of M&T's net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 3.92% in 2004's second quarter from 4.12% in the year-earlier period. The primary factor for such decline was a lower interest rate environment which resulted in the yields on earning assets decreasing more than the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. -more-
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality. The provision for credit losses totaled $30 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with $36 million a year earlier. Net charge-offs of loans during the recent quarter were $21 million, compared with $23 million in the year-earlier period. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .23% in 2004's second quarter, compared with .26% in the corresponding 2003 period. Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $190 million, or .51% of total loans at June 30, 2004, down significantly from $319 million or .86% at June 30, 2003. The substantial decrease in nonperforming loans at the recent quarter-end as compared with a year earlier was largely the result of several large commercial loans that are no longer in M&T's loan portfolio due to a combination of sales, payoffs or charge-offs, including a net reduction of nonperforming loans associated with the former Allfirst franchise totaling $78 million. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $135 million at the recent quarter-end, compared with $170 million a year earlier. Included in these loans at June 30, 2004 and 2003 were $112 million and $136 million, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Nonperforming loans and loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest included loans obtained in the Allfirst transaction of $31 million and $19 million, respectively, at June 30, 2004 and $109 million and $33 million, respectively, at June 30, 2003. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $19 million at June 30, 2004, compared with $23 million a year earlier. Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses totaled $625 million, or 1.66% of total loans, at June 30, 2004, compared with $604 million, or 1.63%, a year earlier. The ratio of -more-
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 328% and 189% at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Noninterest Income and Expense. Noninterest income in the recent quarter totaled $232 million, compared with $233 million in the year-earlier quarter. Increases in deposit account service charges, letter of credit and other credit-related fees, and other revenues were offset by a $14 million decline in mortgage banking revenues. Such decline reflected lower loan origination and sales volumes and the impact of adopting recently issued accounting guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 105, "Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments." SAB No. 105 addresses the accounting for loans held for sale and loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. M&T adopted the SEC guidance effective April 1, 2004 and although such adoption had no economic impact on M&T, it resulted in a $6 million accounting deferral of mortgage banking revenues from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2004. This accounting deferral reflects a delay in the timing of revenue recognition for servicing and certain other cash flows associated with the underlying loans to the time of loan sale. Neither the amount or timing of receipt of such cash flows nor the economic value of the loans and commitments have changed as a result of this accounting guidance. Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2004 totaled $357 million, 17% lower than $431 million in 2003's second quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $19 million in 2004 and $23 million in 2003, and merger-related expenses of $33 million in 2003. There were no merger-related expenses in 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $338 million in the -more-
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION recent quarter, down from $375 million in the second quarter of 2003. The most significant contributor to the lower nonoperating expenses in 2004 was the $22 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights recorded during the recently completed quarter. As already noted, the partial reversal of the valuation allowance reflects the increase in the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights resulting from higher residential mortgage loan interest rates at June 30, 2004 as compared with a quarter earlier. An $18 million provision for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights was recorded during the second quarter of 2003, largely the result of the low interest rate environment that existed at the end of that quarter. Capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, net of impairment valuation allowance, are included in "other assets" in M&T's consolidated balance sheet and totaled $140 million and $92 million at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 50.4% in the second quarter of 2004, improved from 56.2% in the year-earlier period. Commenting on M&T's financial performance during the recent quarter, Michael P. Pinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "M&T's second quarter results reflect continued strong credit quality. During the period, several large nonperforming commercial credits were worked out, resulting in a significant reduction in M&T's nonperforming loans. We continue -more-
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION to be encouraged by growth in our loan portfolios. Furthermore, although residential mortgage banking revenues decreased significantly from 2003's second quarter, the expected reversal of $22 million of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights more than offset that decline." Looking forward to the remainder of 2004, Mr. Pinto commented, "Subject to the impact of future economic and political conditions, at this time we expect that M&T's full-year GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share for 2004 will be consistent with our previously announced estimate." Balance Sheet. M&T had total assets of $52.1 billion at June 30, 2004, up from $50.4 billion at June 30, 2003. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, aggregated $37.5 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $37.0 billion a year earlier. Deposits were $35.0 billion at June 30, 2004, up from $32.5 billion at June 30, 2003. Total stockholders' equity was $5.7 billion at June 30, 2004, representing 10.86% of total assets, compared with $5.4 billion or 10.78% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $48.21 and $45.46 at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $22.40 at June 30, 2004, compared with $19.47 at June 30, 2003. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In February 2004, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. During the recent quarter, 1,848,900 shares of common stock were repurchased by M&T pursuant to such plan at an average -more-

During the first half of 2004, M&T had repurchased 3,616,800 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $89.41 per share, including 1,367,900 shares repurchased under a November 2001 authorization that was completed during 2004's initial quarter.
