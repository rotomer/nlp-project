EXHIBIT 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the second quarter of 2005 were $1.69, up 10% from $1.53 in the corresponding period of 2004. GAAP-basis net income in the recently completed quarter totaled $197 million, 7% higher than $184 million in the second quarter of 2004. GAAP-basis net income for 2005's second quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.46% and 13.73%, respectively, compared with 1.45% and 13.12%, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     For the first two quarters of 2005, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share were $3.31, up 17% from $2.83 in the similar 2004 period. On the same basis, net income for the first half of 2005 totaled $386 million, 12% higher than $344 million a year earlier. GAAP-basis net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholdersequity was 1.45% and 13.57%, respectively, compared with 1.37% and 12.15%, respectively, in the corresponding 2004 period.

2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $9 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the recent quarter, compared with $12 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the year-earlier quarter. Similar after tax effect amortization charges for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 were $18 million ($.15 per diluted share) and $25 million ($.20 per diluted share), respectively. There were no merger-related expenses in either 2005 or 2004.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, were $1.76 in the recent quarter, a rise of 8% from $1.63 in the second quarter of 2004. Net operating income during 2005's second quarter grew 5% to $205 million from $196 million in the corresponding 2004 period. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.62% and 29.88%, respectively, in 2005's second quarter, compared with 1.64% and 30.12% in the second quarter of 2004.
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     For the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, diluted net operating earnings per share were $3.46, 14% higher than $3.03 in the year-earlier period. Net operating income for the first two quarters of 2005 rose 10% to $405 million from $369 million in the similar 2004 period. For the first half of 2005, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.61% and 29.77%, respectively, compared with 1.56% and 27.95% in the first six months of 2004.
      A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share and net income with diluted net operating earnings per share and net operating income follows:

      A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity follows:
Reconciliation of Total Assets and Equity to Tangible Assets and Equity.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 3% to $452 million in the second quarter of 2005 from $438 million in the corresponding 2004 quarter. Average loans outstanding totaled $39.2 billion in the recent quarter, 6% higher than $36.9 billion in the second quarter of 2004. Such growth was attributable to 11% increases in average outstanding balances of commercial and commercial real estate loans. Average consumer loans declined 4% from the year-earlier period, as higher outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit were more than offset by lower automobile loans and leases and planned runoff of other second-mortgage loans. Partially offsetting the favorable impact of higher outstanding loan balances was a narrowing of M&T's net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets. Net interest margin

declined to 3.78% in the recent quarter from 3.92% in the second quarter of 2004. Such decline reflects the impact of rising short-term interest rates over the past twelve months, which resulted in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yields on many earning assets.
      As a percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs in the recent quarter were at their lowest level since 2000. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .14% in 2005's second quarter, significantly improved from .23% in the year-earlier quarter. In dollar total, net charge-offs were $14 million in the recent quarter, down 35% from $21 million in the second quarter of 2004. Reflecting the reduced level of net charge-offs, as well as improvements in other credit quality indicators, the provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2005 was $19 million, down from $30 million in the corresponding 2004 quarter. Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $184 million, or .46% of total loans at June 30, 2005, compared with $190 million or .51% a year earlier. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $123 million at the recent quarter-end, compared with $135 million a year earlier. Included in those past due loans at June 30, 2005 and 2004 were $99 million and $112 million, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $8 million at June 30, 2005, compared with $19 million at June 30, 2004.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $637 million, or 1.60% of total loans, at June 30, 2005, compared with $625 million, or 1.66%, a year earlier. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans reflects
Allowance for Credit Losses.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
improvement in various credit factors, including the previously noted decreases in the rate of net loan charge-offs and the level of nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2004, the allowance for credit losses totaled $627 million, or 1.63% of total loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 346%, 328% and 364% at June 30, 2005, June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004, respectively.
      Noninterest income in the recent quarter totaled $245 million, up 6% from $232 million in the second quarter of 2004. Contributing to the improvement were higher deposit account service charges, trading account and foreign exchange gains, letter of credit and other credit-related fees, and gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2005 totaled $380 million, 7% above $357 million in 2004's second quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $14 million in 2005 and $19 million in 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $366 million in the recently completed quarter, up from $338 million in the second quarter of 2004. The most significant contributor to that rise in operating expenses was a $27 million increase in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Reflecting a decrease in the value of such servicing rights that resulted from lower residential mortgage loan interest rates at the end of the recent quarter as compared with three months earlier, a $5 million impairment provision was recorded during the second quarter of 2005. In contrast, a partial reversal of the
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights was recorded in last year's second quarter that lowered operating expenses by $22 million.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 52.6% in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 50.4% in the year-earlier period.
     Reflecting on M&T's second quarter results, Rene F. Jones, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, "M&T's financial performance during the recent quarter was strong and day-to-day operating results remained consistent with our previous expectations for 2005. Favorable trends have continued regarding the quality of our loan portfolios, including historically low levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans outstanding. In addition, our focus on controlling operating expenses is paying off, as reflected in our results. In fact, excluding the mortgage servicing rights adjustments, operating expenses in the first half of 2005 were lower than in 2004."
      M&T had total assets of $54.5 billion at June 30, 2005, up from $52.1 billion at June 30, 2004. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, rose 6% to $39.9 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $37.5 billion a year earlier. Deposits totaled $37.3 billion at June 30, 2005, up 7% from $35.0 billion at June 30, 2004. Total stockholders' equity was $5.8 billion at June 30, 2005, representing 10.71% of total assets, compared with $5.7 billion or 10.86% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $51.20 and $48.21 at June 30,

2005 and 2004, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $25.00 at June 30, 2005, compared with $22.40 at June 30, 2004. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.0 billion at each of June 30, 2005 and 2004.
     In December 2004, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. During the recent quarter, 624,000 shares of common stock were repurchased by M&T pursuant to such plan at an average cost per share of $102.21. Through June 30, 2005, M&T had repurchased 2,643,300 shares of its common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $101.73 per share.
