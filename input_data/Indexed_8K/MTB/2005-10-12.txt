     (c) Exhibits.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the third quarter of 2005 were $1.64, up 5% from $1.56 in the year-earlier period. On the same basis, net income in the recent quarter totaled $191 million, 2% higher than $186 million in the third quarter of 2004. GAAP-basis net income for 2005's third quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.39% and 12.97%, respectively, compared with 1.42% and 13.02%, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     The recent quarter's results reflect a $29 million non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"). The write-down was taken on $133 million of variable-rate preferred securities that M&T continues to hold. Although the securities are still rated as investment grade, M&T recognized the impairment charge at this time, in accordance with GAAP, in light of changing circumstances during the recent quarter that included an announced further delay in FNMA's ability to provide restated financial information about its results of operations until late

2006 and a further decline in the market value of certain of FHLMC's preferred stock issuances following its release of operating results. However, because the preferred securities have been held by M&T in its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, the unrealized losses had already been recorded as reductions of other comprehensive income and, therefore, no incremental reductions of investment securities or stockholders' equity were required. Accordingly, the accounting treatment for the impairment charge made pursuant to GAAP had no significant effect on M&T's consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the impairment charge and the recognition of available income tax benefits, M&T's reported net income in the recent quarter was reduced by $18 million, or $.16 of diluted earnings per share.
     Results for the third quarter of last year also included certain notable events. M&T reorganized certain of its subsidiaries in 2004's third quarter which decreased M&T's effective state income tax rate for that quarter. As a result, both M&T's income tax expense during the third quarter of 2004 and M&T's deferred tax liability at September 30, 2004 were reduced by $12 million. In addition, M&T Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, made a tax-deductible $25 million cash contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation, which increased "other expense" by the amount of the contribution while reducing income tax expense by $10 million. The aggregate impact of these events was to decrease net income in the third quarter of 2004 by $3 million or $.02 of diluted earnings per share.
     Commenting on M&T's third quarter results, Ren F. Jones, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated "Although the recent quarter's performance was affected by the non-cash write-down of the preferred stock of certain government-sponsored entities, we are nevertheless pleased with our results.
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
Our ability to contain expenses during a period of slow industry-wide revenue growth is in part attributable to success in our areas of focus initially described in the 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders. That success is reflected in the year-over-year improvement in our efficiency ratio. Furthermore, credit quality continued to be very good as reflected in the relatively low levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans."
     For the first three quarters of 2005, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $4.95 from $4.39 in the comparable year-earlier period. On the same basis, net income for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $577 million, up 9% from the $530 million earned in the similar 2004 period. GAAP-basis net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholdersequity was 1.43% and 13.37%, respectively, compared with 1.39% and 12.44%, respectively, in the corresponding 2004 period.

      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, because such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $9 million ($.08 per

diluted share) in the recent quarter, compared with $11 million ($.09 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2004. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 were $27 million ($.23 per diluted share) and $36 million ($.30 per diluted share), respectively. There were no merger-related expenses in either 2005 or 2004.
     Reflecting the impact of each year's third quarter events described earlier, diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, were $1.72 in the third quarter of 2005, up 4% from $1.65 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income totaled $200 million and $198 million in the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.54% and 27.67%, respectively, in 2005's third quarter, compared with 1.60% and 29.42% in the year-earlier quarter.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 rose 10% to $5.18 from $4.69 in the similar period of 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, net operating income totaled $604 million, 7% higher than $566 million in the year-earlier period. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity, net operating income for the first three quarters of 2005 was 1.59% and 29.04%, respectively, compared with 1.58% and 28.45% in the first nine months of 2004.

      Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $460 million in the third quarter of 2005 from $444 million in the year-earlier quarter. Average loans outstanding totaled $39.9 billion in the recent quarter, compared with $37.6 billion in the third quarter of 2004. Largely offsetting the favorable impact of higher outstanding loan balances was a narrowing of M&T's net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 3.76% in 2005's third quarter from 3.85% in the corresponding period of 2004.

      The provision for credit losses totaled $22 million in the recent quarter, compared with $17 million in the third quarter of 2004. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .21% in the third quarter of 2005, compared with .16% in the corresponding 2004 period. In dollar total, net charge-offs during the third quarter of 2005 and 2004 were $22 million and $15 million, respectively.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $166 million, or .41% of total loans at the recent quarter-end, improved from $181 million or .48% at September 30, 2004. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $131 million at September 30, 2005, compared with $140 million a year earlier. Included in these loans at September 30, 2005 and 2004 were $107 million and $111 million, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government-related entities.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $638 million, or 1.58% of total loans, at September 30, 2005, compared with $626 million, or 1.65%, a year earlier. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans reflects improvement in various credit factors and the relatively low levels of net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2004, the allowance for credit losses totaled $627 million, or 1.63% of total loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 383%, 346% and 364% at September 30, 2005, September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      Noninterest income in the recent quarter totaled $221 million, down 10% from $245 million in the year-earlier quarter. The decrease was the result of the previously discussed $29 million non-cash accounting charge recognized during the recent quarter for the other-than-temporary decline in value of the preferred stock of FNMA and FHLMC, partially offset by increases in mortgage banking and other revenues.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2005 totaled $368 million, down from $407 million in 2004's third quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $14 million in 2005 and $19 million in 2004. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $354 million in the recent quarter, down $34 million from $388 million in the third quarter of 2004. The higher operating expenses in 2004's third quarter resulted largely from the previously noted $25 million charitable contribution made in that period. Also contributing to the lower level of operating expenses in 2005 was a $6 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights recorded during the recently completed quarter. The reduction of the valuation allowance reflects an increase in the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights resulting from higher residential mortgage loan interest rates at September 30, 2005 as compared with a quarter earlier. A $7 million addition to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights was recorded during the third quarter of 2004, largely the result of the lower interest rate environment that existed at the end of that quarter as compared with June 30, 2004.

     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 50.0% in the third quarter of 2005, improved significantly from 56.4% in the year-earlier period. If the $25 million charitable contribution was excluded from the computation, M&T's efficiency ratio during 2004's third quarter would have been 52.7%.
      M&T had total assets of $54.8 billion at September 30, 2005, up from $52.9 billion at September 30, 2004. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, aggregated $40.3 billion at September 30, 2005, compared with $38.0 billion a year earlier. Deposits totaled $37.2 billion at the recent quarter-end, up from $35.0 billion at September 30, 2004. Total stockholders' equity was $5.8 billion at September 30, 2005, representing 10.66% of total assets, compared with $5.7 billion or 10.80% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $51.81 and $49.11 at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $25.42 at September 30, 2005, compared with $23.17 at September 30, 2004. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.0 billion at September 30, 2005 and 2004.
