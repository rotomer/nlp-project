     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for 2005.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") increased 12% to $6.73 in 2005 from $6.00 in 2004. On the same basis, net income in 2005 was $782 million, up 8% from $723 million earned in 2004. GAAP-basis net income for 2005 expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.44% and 13.49%, respectively, compared with 1.40% and 12.67%, respectively, in 2004.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 rose 10% to $1.78 from $1.62 in the corresponding period of 2004. On the same basis, net income for the recent quarter increased to $205 million, up 7% from $192 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity, GAAP-basis net income for 2005's final quarter was 1.48% and 13.85%, respectively, compared with 1.45% and 13.37%, respectively, in the year-earlier period.
     Reflecting on 2005's financial results, Ren F. Jones, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, Overall, M&T had another successful year in 2005. Improved credit quality,
"

reflecting a continuation of our prudent underwriting standards, coupled with our success in containing expenses were the leading forces behind M&T's strong financial performance. Given the challenging interest rate environment and the resultant slow revenue growth that we had forecasted a year ago, it was extremely important for M&T to focus on controlling costs to maintain an acceptable spread between the growth in revenues and expenses. The implementation of several corporate initiatives, coupled with the hard work and dedication of our employees, have allowed us to enhance the efficiency of our operations."
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, because such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $35 million ($.30 per diluted share) and $46 million ($.38 per diluted share), respectively. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, totaled $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $10 million ($.08 per diluted share) in the year-earlier quarter.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, were $7.03 in 2005, 10% higher than $6.38 in 2004. Net operating income for 2005 increased 6% to $817 million from $769 million in 2004. Net operating income in 2005 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity was 1.60% and 29.06%, respectively, compared with 1.59% and 28.76% in 2004.
     For the fourth quarter of 2005, diluted net operating earnings per share were $1.85, 9% higher than $1.70 in the corresponding 2004 period. Net operating income for 2005's final quarter rose 5% to $213 million from $202 million in the similar period in 2004. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2005, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.63% and 29.12%, respectively, compared with 1.62% and 29.69% in the year-earlier period.

Reconciliation of Total Assets and Equity to Tangible Assets and Equity.
      Led by growth in average loan balances outstanding, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 3% to $1.81 billion in 2005 from $1.75 billion in 2004. Average loans outstanding rose 6% to $39.5 billion in 2005 from $37.1 billion in 2004. Partially offsetting the positive impact of loan growth was a narrowing of M&T's net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004. That narrowing resulted from rising short-term interest rates that produced a flattening of the yield curve in 2005 as compared with historic norms.
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     During the final quarter of 2005, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $454 million, 2% higher than $446 million in the year-earlier quarter. Average loans outstanding and annualized net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $40.4 billion and 3.69%, respectively, compared with $38.1 billion and 3.82% in the similar 2004 period.
      The provision for credit losses totaled $88 million in 2005, down from $95 million in 2004. Net loan charge-offs in 2005 totaled $77 million, or .19% of average loans outstanding, improved from $82 million or .22% of average loans in 2004. The provision for credit losses was $23 million during the final three months of 2005, compared with $28 million in the year-earlier period. Net charge-offs of loans were nearly $23 million in 2005's fourth quarter, representing an annualized .22% of average loans outstanding, compared with $27 million or .29% during the similar 2004 quarter.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming declined to $156 million, or .39% of total loans at December 31, 2005, compared with $172 million or .45% a year earlier. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $129 million at the recent year-end, compared with $155 million at December 31, 2004. Included in these past due, but accruing loans at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $106 million and $121 million, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans remained at low levels, totaling $9 million at December 31, 2005 and $13 million at December 31, 2004.
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $638 million, or 1.58% of total loans, at December 31, 2005, compared with $627 million, or 1.63%, a year earlier. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans reflects improvement in various credit factors, including lower levels of net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 408% and 364% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
      Noninterest income totaled $950 million in 2005, compared with $943 million in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a previously disclosed $29 million non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment charge in the third quarter related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Noninterest income of $249 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 was up 5% from $238 million in the corresponding 2004 quarter, due in part to higher revenues from providing mortgage banking and corporate financing advisory services.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in 2005 aggregated $1.49 billion, down 2% from $1.52 billion in 2004. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be "nonoperating" in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $57 million in 2005 and $75 million in 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.43 billion in 2005 and $1.44 billion in 2004. Included in 2004's
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
operating expenses was a $25 million tax-deductible contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1% from 2004, reflecting M&Ts ongoing efforts to control expenses. Increases in the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and higher professional services expenses were partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights during 2005 as compared with 2004, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates.

     Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled $369 million, compared with $362 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $13 million in 2005 and $16 million in 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $356 million in the recently completed quarter, compared with $346 million in the final 2004 quarter. Higher costs for employee benefits and professional services were the leading contributors to that increase, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 51.2% in 2005, improved from 53.5% in 2004. If the $25 million charitable contribution was excluded from the computation, M&T's efficiency ratio for 2004 would have been 52.6%. During 2005's fourth
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
quarter, M&T's efficiency ratio was 50.7%, compared with 50.6% in the year-earlier quarter.
      M&T had total assets of $55.1 billion at December 31, 2005, up from $52.9 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, aggregated $40.3 billion at the 2005 year-end, up 5% from $38.4 billion at December 31, 2004. Deposits grew 5% to $37.1 billion at December 31, 2005 from $35.4 billion at the end of 2004. Total stockholders' equity was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2005, representing 10.66% of total assets, compared with $5.7 billion or 10.82% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $52.39 at December 31, 2005, compared with $49.68 a year earlier. Tangible equity per common share was $25.91 and $23.62 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
Balance Sheet.
     During 2005, M&T repurchased 4,891,800 shares of its common stock under authorized repurchase plans at an average cost of $104.18 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, a total of 951,700 shares were repurchased by M&T at an average per share cost of $107.03, including 44,700 shares under a new authorization approved in December 2005 by M&T's Board of Directors allowing for the purchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock.
