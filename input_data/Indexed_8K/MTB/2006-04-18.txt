EXHIBIT 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the first quarter of 2006 were $1.77, 9% higher than $1.62 in the corresponding period of 2005. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter totaled $203 million, up 7% from $189 million in the year-earlier period. GAAP-basis net income for 2006's initial quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.49% and 13.97%, respectively, each improved from 1.44% and 13.41%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2005.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     Commenting on M&T's first quarter financial results, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, noted, "M&T posted solid results in the first reporting period of 2006, led by excellent credit quality, 8% growth in fee income and continued success at containing expense growth. We were also encouraged by the 9% annualized rate of growth in our commercial loan and commercial mortgage loan portfolios. This drove annualized growth in total loans, excluding those held for purposes of sale, to 6% relative to the fourth quarter of 2005, while the net interest margin of 3.73% was consistent with our internal expectations."

      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the recently completed quarter, compared with $10 million ($.08 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2005. There were no merger-related expenses in either of the first quarters of 2006 or 2005.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, were $1.84 for the initial quarter of 2006, 8% above $1.70 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was $211 million, up 6% from $199 million in the corresponding quarter of 2005. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.64% and 29.31%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 1.61% and 29.67% in 2005's initial quarter.

      Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $452 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $446 million in the corresponding 2005 quarter. Higher average loan balances outstanding, which rose 5% to $40.5 billion in 2006's initial quarter from $38.6 billion in the corresponding 2005 period, were the most significant contributor to the increase. Partially offsetting the favorable impact of loan growth was a lower net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, which declined to 3.73% in the recent quarter from 3.83% in the first quarter of 2005. The decline in net interest margin from 2005's first quarter reflects the continuing impact of rising short-term interest rates, which resulted in a narrowing of M&T's net interest margin as the rates

paid on interest-bearing liabilities rose more rapidly than the yields on many earning assets. The recent quarter's net interest margin was improved from 3.69% in the fourth quarter of 2005.
      The provision for credit losses totaled $18 million in the recent quarter, down from $24 million in the initial quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs of loans during the first quarter of 2006 were $17 million, compared with $19 million in the year-earlier period. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .17% and .20% in the first quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $143 million, or .35% of total loans at March 31, 2006, improved from $180 million or .46% a year earlier and $156 million or .39% at December 31, 2005. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $109 million at the end of the recently completed quarter, compared with $125 million at March 31, 2005. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $86 million and $102 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $10 million at March 31, 2006, compared with $11 million a year earlier.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $639 million, or 1.56% of total loans, at March 31, 2006, compared with $632 million, or 1.62%, a year earlier. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans reflects improvement in various credit factors, including the decrease in nonperforming loans already noted. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for credit losses totaled $638 million, representing 1.58% of total loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 448%, 351% and 408% at March 31, 2006, March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

      Noninterest income in the initial quarter of 2006 totaled $253 million, up 8% from $234 million in the year-earlier quarter. The improvement was led by higher income from commercial leasing and educational lending, but also included growth in several other sources of fee income.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2006 totaled $382 million, compared with $367 million in the similar quarter of 2005. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $13 million in 2006 and $16 million in 2005. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $369 million in the recently completed quarter and $351 million in the first quarter of 2005. Contributing to the rise in operating expenses in 2006 were higher salaries expenses, including stock-based compensation costs. Effective January 1, 2006, M&T adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment,"("SFAS No. 123R"). As required by SFAS No. 123R, in 2006 the Company began accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award since those awards vest when an employee retires. As a result, stock-based compensation expense during the first quarter of 2006 included $6 million that would have been recognized over the normal four year vesting period if not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 123R. That acceleration has no effect on the value of stock-based compensation awarded to employees. If the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R was excluded from the recent quarter's expenses, noninterest operating expenses increased 3% from the year-earlier period.

     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 52.4% in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 51.6% in the year-earlier period. If not for the acceleration of expense recognition resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, M&T's efficiency ratio in the recent quarter would have been 51.5%.
      M&T had total assets of $55.4 billion at March 31, 2006, compared with $53.9 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, increased 5% to $40.9 billion at the recent quarter-end from $39.1 billion at March 31, 2005. Deposits were $38.2 billion at March 31, 2006, up from $36.3 billion a year earlier. Total stockholders' equity was $5.9 billion and $5.7 billion at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing 10.68% of total assets at the recent quarter-end and 10.53% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $53.11 and $49.78 at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $26.41 at March 31, 2006, compared with $23.49 a year earlier. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.0 billion at March 31, 2006 and 2005.
Balance Sheet.
     In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. During the recent quarter, 1,269,000 shares of common stock were repurchased by M&T pursuant to such plan at an average cost per share of $108.51. Through March 31, 2006, M&T
