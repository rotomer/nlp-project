Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the second quarter of 2006 were $1.87, up 11% from $1.69 in the year-earlier period. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter totaled $213 million, 8% higher than $197 million in the second quarter of 2005. GAAP-basis net income for 2006's second quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.54% and 14.35%, respectively, compared with 1.46% and 13.73%, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2005.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     For the first half of 2006, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share were $3.64, 10% higher than $3.31 in the similar 2005 period. On the same basis, net income for the first two quarters of 2006 totaled $415 million, up 8% from $386 million in the first half of 2005. GAAP-basis net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.52% and 14.16%, respectively, compared with 1.45% and 13.57%, respectively, in the corresponding 2005 period.
 
2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     As previously announced, on June 30, 2006 M&T Bank, M&T's principal banking subsidiary, completed the acquisition of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million in loans and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits. Although the June 30 transaction had no effect on day-to-day operating results, expenses associated with systems conversions and other costs of integrating and introducing Citibank, N.A.'s former customers to M&T's products and services aggregated $2 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.02 of diluted earnings per share during the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2006. M&T will incur additional acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2006.
     In discussing the recent quarter's financial results, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of M&T noted, "Our results for the quarter reflect many of M&T's traditional strengths. Continued attention to efficiency and the benefits of our consistent credit standards led to double-digit growth in M&T's diluted earnings per share." In addition, reflecting on the recently completed branch transaction, Mr. Jones observed, "We are excited about the addition of approximately 60,000 consumer and business customers in our Buffalo and Rochester markets, the second and third largest cities in New York State. The ability to service those customers without a significant increase in distribution costs made this transaction compelling. Our new customers will benefit from having access to M&T's network of ATM and branch facilities in western New York, and our shareholders will benefit from increased operating leverage."
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $7 million ($.06 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2006, compared with $9 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the year-earlier quarter. Similar after tax effect amortization charges for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 were $15 million ($.13 per diluted share) and $18 million ($.15 per diluted share), respectively. As already noted, expenses related to the acquisition of branch offices, deposits and loans totaled $2 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.02 per diluted share in each of the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2006. There were no similar expenses in 2005.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and branch acquisition-related expenses, were $1.95 in 2006's second quarter, a rise of 11% from $1.76 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income during 2006's second quarter grew 8% to $222 million from $205 million in the similar 2005 period. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating

income was 1.69% and 30.02%, respectively, in the recent quarter, compared with 1.62% and 29.88% in the second quarter of 2005.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006 rose 10% to $3.79 from $3.46 in the year-earlier period. Net operating income for the first half of 2006 was $433 million, up 7% from $405 million in the corresponding 2005 period. For the first six months of 2006, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.67% and 29.67%, respectively, compared with 1.61% and 29.77% in the first two quarters of 2005.

      A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity follows:
Reconciliation of Total Assets and Equity to Tangible Assets and Equity.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income was little changed from a year earlier totaling $451 million in the second quarter of 2006. Net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, declined to 3.66% in the recent quarter from 3.78% in the second quarter of 2005. Such decline reflects the continuing impact of higher short-term interest rates, which resulted in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yields on many earning assets. The recent quarter's net interest margin also declined from 3.73% in 2006's initial quarter. Largely offsetting the impact of the lower net interest margin was growth in average loans and leases which totaled $41.0 billion in the recent quarter, 4% higher than $39.2 billion in
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
the second quarter of 2005. Such growth was attributable to average outstanding balance increases in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans. Average consumer loans declined 9% from the year-earlier period, the result of lower automobile loans and leases outstanding, continuing a two-year trend during which M&T has decided not to extend such credit at unfavorable interest rates.
      The provision for credit losses totaled $17 million in the recent quarter, down from $19 million in the second quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs of loans during the second quarter of 2006 were $10 million, compared with $14 million in the year-earlier period. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .10% and .14% in the second quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $156 million, or .38% of total loans at June 30, 2006, compared with $184 million or .46% a year earlier, $156 million or .39% at December 31, 2005 and $143 million or .35% at March 31, 2006. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $101 million at the end of the recently completed quarter, compared with $123 million at June 30, 2005. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $79 million and $99 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $14 million at June 30, 2006, compared with $8 million a year earlier.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $646 million, or 1.55% of total loans, at June 30, 2006, compared with $637 million, or 1.60%, a year earlier. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans reflects improvement in various credit factors, including the previously
Allowance for Credit Losses.
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
noted decreases in the rate of net loan charge-offs and the level of nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for credit losses totaled $638 million, or 1.58% of total loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 414%, 346% and 408% at June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
      Noninterest income in the recent quarter totaled $263 million, a 7% improvement from $245 million in the second quarter of 2005. Contributing to the increase were higher mortgage banking revenues, deposit account service charges and trust income.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2006 totaled $377 million, 1% below the year-earlier period's total of $380 million. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $11 million in 2006 and $14 million in 2005, and branch acquisition-related expenses of $4 million in 2006. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $362 million in the recently completed quarter, down from $366 million in the second quarter of 2005. The most significant contributor to the lower level of operating expenses was an $8 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights recorded during the recently completed quarter. The reduction of the valuation allowance reflects an increase in the value of capitalized servicing rights resulting from higher residential mortgage loan interest rates at the end of the recent quarter as compared with three months earlier. A $5 million addition to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights was recorded during the second quarter of 2005. Higher costs for salaries in the recent quarter as compared with
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
the second quarter of 2005 partially offset the favorable impact of the change in the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 50.7% in the second quarter of 2006, compared with 52.6% in the year-earlier period.
      M&T had total assets of $56.5 billion at June 30, 2006, up from $54.5 billion at June 30, 2005. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, rose 4% to $41.6 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $39.9 billion a year earlier. Reflecting the deposits obtained in the June 30 branch acquisition, total deposits were $38.5 billion at June 30, 2006, up 3% from $37.3 billion at June 30, 2005. Total stockholders' equity was $6.0 billion at June 30, 2006, representing 10.62% of total assets, compared with $5.8 billion or 10.71% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $54.01 and $51.20 at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $25.55 at June 30, 2006, compared with $25.00 at June 30, 2005. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Balance Sheet.
     In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. During the recent quarter, 605,700 shares of common stock were repurchased by M&T pursuant to such plan at an
