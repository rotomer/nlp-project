Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the third quarter of 2006 were $1.85, 13% higher than $1.64 in the corresponding period of 2005. On the same basis, net income in the recent quarter totaled $210 million, up 10% from $191 million in the third quarter of 2005. GAAP-basis net income for 2006's third quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.49% and 13.72%, respectively, compared with 1.39% and 12.97%, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     M&T's third quarter 2006 results reflect the impact of the June 30, 2006 acquisition by M&T Bank of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million in loans and $1.0 billion in deposits. Including the impact of the amortization of core deposit intangible resulting from the transaction and acquisition-related expenses, net income and diluted earnings per share in the recent quarter were reduced by approximately $5 million and $.04, respectively, as a result of the transaction.

     The recent quarter's results also reflect certain other notable events that in total had no significant effect on net income. M&T recorded a $13 million gain resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB") borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. After applicable taxes, that gain added $8 million to net income. Also reflected in the 2006 third quarter results was a $3 million reduction of income tax expense related to the favorable settlement of refund claims originally filed by Allfirst Financial Inc. prior to its acquisition by M&T on April 1, 2003. The refunds received, consisting of income taxes and taxable interest, exceeded the amounts previously accrued for such items by $5 million (pre-tax). Finally, an $18 million tax deductible contribution was made by M&T Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt private charitable foundation, which increased "other expense" by the amount of the contribution and, after applicable tax effect, reduced net income by $11 million. As noted above, the aggregate impact of these events had no significant effect on M&T's net income or diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2006.
     Last year's third quarter results reflected a $29 million non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"). As a result of that impairment charge and the recognition of available income tax benefits, M&T's reported net income in 2005's third quarter was reduced by $18 million, or $.16 of diluted earnings per share.
     Commenting on M&T's third quarter results, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, noted,
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
"Despite a less than desirable rate environment and modest loan growth, M&T posted strong results for the third quarter. Highlights of the quarter included the integration of 21 branches in upstate New York acquired at the end of the second quarter of 2006, a stable net interest margin, strong credit quality and continued success at managing operating expense levels."
     Further commenting on M&T's operating expense levels, Mr. Jones noted, "Even after considering the incremental costs added to our recent quarter's expense totals associated with the acquired branches, M&T's operating expenses were held in check. In fact, after excluding the recent quarter's $18 million charitable contribution and mortgage impairment charges and recoveries, operating expenses in the third quarter decreased from the second quarter by over $4 million."
     For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share rose 11% to $5.49 from $4.95 in the similar period of 2005. On the same basis, net income for the first three quarters of 2006 totaled $626 million, up 8% from the $577 million earned in the corresponding 2005 period. GAAP-basis net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.51% and 14.01%, respectively, compared with 1.43% and 13.37%, respectively, in the similar nine-month period of 2005.
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable

deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, because such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $12 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the recent quarter, compared with $9 million ($.08 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2005. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 were $27 million or $.23 per diluted share. The after-tax effect of amortization of the core deposit intangible associated with the June 2006 branch acquisition was $5 million and of expenses related to the acquisition and integration of those branch offices was $1 million during the third quarter of 2006. Together, those items totaled $6 million, after tax effect, or $.05 per diluted share in the recent quarter. Acquisition and integration-related expenses totaled $3 million, after tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2006. There were no similar expenses in 2005.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.96 in the third quarter of 2006, 14% higher than $1.72 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income totaled $223 million and $200 million in the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. The second quarter branch acquisition was slightly accretive to the recent quarter's diluted net operating earnings per share. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.67% and 30.22%,
 
5-5-5-5-5 M&T BANK CORPORATION
respectively, in 2006's third quarter, compared with 1.54% and 27.67% in the year-earlier quarter.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 increased 11% to $5.75 from $5.18 in the corresponding period of 2005. For the first nine months of 2006, net operating income totaled $656 million, 9% above $604 million in the year-earlier period. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity, net operating income for the first three quarters of 2006 was 1.67% and 29.86%, respectively, compared with 1.59% and 29.04% in the first nine months of 2005.

      Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $462 million in the third quarter of 2006, up slightly from $460 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, was 3.68% in 2006's third quarter, compared with 3.76% in the corresponding period of 2005. Such decline reflects the continuing impact of higher short-term interest rates, which resulted in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on many earning assets. However, reflecting a more stable short-term interest rate environment in the recent quarter, the net interest margin in 2006's third quarter was 2 basis points (hundredths of one percent) higher than in 2006's second quarter. Largely offsetting the impact of a lower net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared

with the year-earlier quarter was growth in average loans and leases, which aggregated $41.7 billion in 2006's third quarter, up 5% from $39.9 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Such growth was attributable to increases in average outstanding balances of 9% in commercial loans, 6% in commercial real estate loans and 18% in residential real estate loans, while average consumer loans declined 7% from the third quarter of 2005. The major factor in that decline was a drop in automobile loans and leases outstanding resulting from M&T's decision to allow such loans to decline rather than matching interest rates that M&T believes are inadequate, but that are being offered by competitors.
      The provision for credit losses totaled $17 million in the recent quarter, down from $22 million in the third quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs of loans during the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 were also $17 million and $22 million, respectively. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .16% in the recently completed quarter, compared with .21% in the corresponding 2005 period.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $180 million, or .43% of total loans at the recent quarter-end, up from $166 million or .41% at September 30, 2005 and $156 million at each of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2006, or .39% and .38% of total loans at those respective dates. The increase from the prior periods was due to the recent quarter addition of approximately $26 million of loans related to a single automobile dealer relationship. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $112 million at September 30, 2006, compared with $131 million a year earlier. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
entities of $76 million and $107 million, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $14 million at September 30, 2006, compared with $9 million a year earlier.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $646 million, or 1.54% of total loans, at September 30, 2006, compared with $638 million, or 1.58%, a year earlier and at December 31, 2005. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 360%, 383% and 408% at September 30, 2006, September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
      Noninterest income in the recent quarter totaled $274 million, up 24% from $221 million in the year-earlier quarter. The increase reflects the previously discussed $13 million gain recognized in the recent quarter from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB borrowing assumed in an acquisition and the $29 million non-cash accounting charge recognized during 2005's third quarter for the other-than-temporary decline in value of the preferred stock of FNMA and FHLMC.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2006 totaled $409 million, compared with $368 million in 2005's third quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $20 million in 2006 and $14 million in 2005 and merger-related expenses of $1 million in 2006. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $388 million in the recent quarter, compared with $354 million in the third quarter of 2005. The higher operating expenses in the recent quarter reflect the $18 million charitable contribution made
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
in the quarter and a $5 million addition to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights. The addition to the valuation allowance reflects a decrease in the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights resulting from lower residential mortgage loan interest rates at September 30, 2006 as compared with a quarter earlier. A $6 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights was recorded during the third quarter of 2005, largely the result of the higher interest rate environment that existed at the end of that quarter as compared with June 30, 2005.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 52.8% in the third quarter of 2006, compared with 50.0% in the year-earlier period. Were the $18 million charitable contribution and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing with the FHLB excluded from the computation, the efficiency ratio in the recent quarter would have been 51.2%.
      M&T had total assets of $56.4 billion at September 30, 2006, up from $54.8 billion at September 30, 2005. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, totaled $42.1 billion at September 30, 2006, compared with $40.3 billion a year earlier. Deposits aggregated $39.1 billion at the recent quarter-end, up from $37.2 billion at September 30, 2005. Total stockholders' equity was $6.2 billion at September 30, 2006, representing 10.91% of total assets, compared with $5.8 billion or 10.66% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $55.58 and $51.81 at September 30, 2006 and 2005,

respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $27.15 at September 30, 2006, compared with $25.42 at September 30, 2005. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
     In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. During the recent quarter, 762,000 shares of common stock were repurchased by M&T pursuant to such plan at an average cost per share of $120.44. Through September 30, 2006, M&T had repurchased 2,681,400 shares of its common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $113.31 per share.
