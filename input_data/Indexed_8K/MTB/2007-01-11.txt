Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for 2006.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") rose 10% to $7.37 in 2006 from $6.73 in 2005. On the same basis, net income in 2006 increased 7% to $839 million from $782 million in 2005. GAAP-basis net income for 2006 expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.50% and 13.89%, respectively, compared with 1.44% and 13.49%, respectively, in 2005.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share for 2006's fourth quarter of $1.88 were 6% higher than $1.78 in the year-earlier period. Net income for the recently completed quarter aggregated $213 million, up 4% from $205 million in the final quarter of 2005. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity, GAAP-basis net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 1.50% and 13.55%, respectively, compared with 1.48% and 13.85%, respectively, in the corresponding period of 2005.
     Reflecting on M&T's financial performance in 2006, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Despite a rather difficult interest rate environment, 2006 proved to be a successful year for M&T. We completed our infrastructure, smartspend and community bank projects, saw
 
2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION
strong growth in our Mid-Atlantic franchise, expanded our branch network in upstate New York and had another year of double-digit growth in earnings per share."
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, because such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $38 million ($.33 per diluted share) and $35 million ($.30 per diluted share), respectively. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, were $11 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the year-earlier quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the after-tax effect of amortization of the core deposit intangible associated with the June 2006 acquisition by M&T Bank of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A. was $11 million or $.09 of diluted earnings per share. Acquisition and integration-related expenses related to the branch acquisition totaled $3 million, after tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share, during 2006. There were no similar expenses in 2006's fourth quarter or during 2005.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.

     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, rose 10% to $7.73 in 2006 from $7.03 in 2005. Net operating income for 2006 increased 8% to $881 million from $817 million in 2005. Net operating income in 2006 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity was 1.67% and 29.55%, respectively, compared with 1.60% and 29.06% in 2005.
     For 2006's fourth quarter, diluted net operating earnings per share were $1.98, up 7% from $1.85 in the corresponding 2005 period. Net operating income for the final quarter of 2006 increased 6% to $225 million from $213 million in the year-earlier period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.67% and 28.71%, respectively, compared with 1.63% and 29.12% in the similar period of 2005.

      Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.84 billion in 2006, up 1% from $1.81 billion in 2005. Average loans and leases outstanding rose 5% to $41.4 billion in 2006 from $39.5 billion in 2005. Such growth was attributable to higher average outstanding balances in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans, offset in part, by a decline in average consumer loans outstanding. The decrease in consumer loan balances resulted from lower automobile loans and leases, reflecting M&T's decision to allow such loan balances to decline rather than matching interest rates offered by competitors. Partially offsetting the positive impact of loan growth was a narrowing of M&T's net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005.
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     During the fourth quarter of 2006, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $472 million, 4% higher than $454 million in the corresponding 2005 quarter. Average loans outstanding and annualized net interest margin in the final quarter of 2006 were $42.5 billion and 3.73%, respectively, compared with $40.4 billion and 3.69% in the year-earlier period. M&T's net interest margin in the recent quarter was improved from 3.68% in the immediately preceding quarter and 3.66% in 2006's second quarter.
      The provision for credit losses totaled $80 million in 2006, down from $88 million in 2005. Net loan charge-offs in 2006 totaled $68 million, or .16% of average loans outstanding, compared with $77 million or .19% of average loans in 2005. The provision for credit losses was $28 million during the final three months of 2006, compared with $23 million in the similar 2005 period. Net charge-offs of loans were $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, representing an annualized .23% of average loans outstanding, compared with $23 million or .22% during the year-earlier quarter.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $224 million, or .52% of total loans at December 31, 2006, compared with $156 million or .39% a year earlier. That increase was largely due to the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers totaling approximately $41 million of loans outstanding at December 31, 2006. Continued slowing of domestic automobile sales has resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results. Also contributing to the higher nonperforming loan balance at December 31, 2006 was a $10 million commercial loan added to that category in the fourth quarter of 2006 that was subsequently paid off in early January 2007. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $111 million at the
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
recent year-end, compared with $129 million at December 31, 2005. Included in these past due, but accruing loans at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $77 million and $106 million, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006 and $9 million at December 31, 2005.
      The allowance for credit losses was $650 million, or 1.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2006, compared with $638 million, or 1.58%, a year earlier. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans from 2005's year-end to December 31, 2006 reflects a change in portfolio mix resulting from higher balances of residential real estate loans and lower balances of consumer loans. In general, M&T experiences significantly lower charge-offs on residential real estate loans than on consumer loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 290% and 408% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
      Noninterest income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006, from $950 million in 2005. Higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Included in noninterest income in 2006 was a $13 million third quarter gain resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB") borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. Losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a $29 million non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment charge in the third quarter related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Noninterest income of $256 million in the fourth
Noninterest Income and Expense.
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
quarter of 2006 was up 3% from $249 million in the similar 2005 quarter, due in part to higher trust and brokerage services activities, service charges on deposit accounts and revenues from bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues.
     Noninterest expense in 2006 totaled $1.55 billion, a 4% increase from $1.49 billion in 2005. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be "nonoperating" in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million in 2006 and $57 million in 2005 and merger-related expenses of $5 million in 2006. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.48 billion in 2006 and $1.43 billion in 2005. Included in 2006's operating expenses was an $18 million tax-deductible contribution made in that year's third quarter to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased $37 million, or 3% from 2005. The most significant contributor to the increase in noninterest expense was a higher level of salaries expense in 2006, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases, an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees and increased stock-based compensation costs.
     Noninterest expense in the final quarter of 2006 totaled $384 million, compared with $369 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $19 million in 2006 and $13 million in 2005. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $365 million in the recent quarter, compared with $356 million in 2005's fourth quarter. Higher costs for salaries and a $1 million increase to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
servicing rights in 2006's fourth quarter, compared with a partial reversal of a portion of such valuation allowance of $6 million in the year-earlier quarter, were the leading contributors to the rise in noninterest expense.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 51.5% in 2006, compared with 51.2% in 2005. During 2006's fourth quarter, M&T's efficiency ratio was 50.2%, compared with 50.7% in the year-earlier quarter.
      M&T had total assets of $57.1 billion at December 31, 2006, up from $55.1 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, totaled $42.9 billion at the 2006 year-end, up 6% from $40.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Deposits were $39.9 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $37.1 billion at the end of 2005. Total stockholders' equity was $6.3 billion at December 31, 2006, representing 11.01% of total assets, compared with $5.9 billion or 10.66% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $56.94 at December 31, 2006, compared with $52.39 a year earlier. Tangible equity per common share was $28.57 and $25.91 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Balance Sheet.
     In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of
