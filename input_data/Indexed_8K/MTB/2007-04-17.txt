     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the first quarter of 2007 were $1.57, compared with $1.77 in the year-earlier quarter. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter totaled $176 million, down 13% from $203 million in the similar 2006 period. GAAP-basis net income for 2007's initial quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.25% and 11.38%, respectively, compared with 1.49% and 13.97%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2006.
GAAP Results of Operations.
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps

investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $11 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the recently completed quarter, compared with $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2006. There were no merger-related expenses in either of the first quarters of 2007 or 2006.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, were $1.67 for the first quarter of 2007, 9% below $1.84 in the corresponding quarter of 2006. Net operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 was $187 million, compared with $211 million in the year-earlier quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.40% and 24.11%, respectively, in the initial quarter of 2007, compared with 1.64% and 29.31% in the first quarter of 2006.

Reconciliation of Total Assets and Equity to Tangible Assets and Equity.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $456 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared with $452 million in the first quarter of 2006. Higher average loan balances outstanding, which rose 6% to $43.1 billion in 2007's initial quarter from $40.5 billion in the year-earlier period, were the most significant contributor to the increase. Partially offsetting the favorable impact of loan growth was a lower net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, which declined to 3.64% in the recent quarter from 3.73% in the first quarter of 2006. That decline reflects lower fees from customer prepayments of commercial real estate loans and higher rates paid on deposits.

      The provision for credit losses was increased to $27 million in the initial 2007 quarter from $18 million in the first quarter of 2006. Net charge-offs of loans during the recent quarter and the year-earlier quarter were $17 million. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .16% and .17% in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $273 million, or .63% of total loans at March 31, 2007, up from $143 million or .35% a year earlier and $224 million or .52% at December 31, 2006. The increase from a year ago was due in part to the addition of $40 million of loans to automobile dealers. Lower domestic automobile sales have resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase in nonperforming loans was the addition during 2007's first quarter of two commercial relationships totaling $40 million, which also represented the majority of the rise in that category from the end of 2006. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $118 million at the end of the recently completed quarter, compared with $109 million at March 31, 2006. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $71 million and $86 million at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $15 million at March 31, 2007, compared with $10 million a year earlier.

      The allowance for credit losses totaled $660 million, or 1.52% of total loans, at March 31, 2007, compared with $639 million, or 1.56%, a year earlier and $650 million, or 1.51%, at December 31, 2006. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans from March 31, 2006 to the two most recent quarter-ends reflects a change in portfolio mix resulting from higher balances of residential real estate loans and lower balances of consumer loans. In general, M&T experiences significantly lower charge-offs on residential real estate loans than on consumer loans. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 241%, 448% and 290% at March 31, 2007, March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
      Noninterest income in the initial quarter of 2007 totaled $236 million, compared with $253 million in the year-earlier quarter. The decline was due to a $21 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues and lower income from commercial leasing and educational lending, partially offset by higher deposit account service charges and trust income. As discussed in a news release issued by M&T on March 30, 2007, the lower mortgage banking revenues were predominantly the result of market conditions that affected the valuation of alternative ("Alt-A") residential mortgage loans that had been held for sale by M&T. As stated in the March news release, unfavorable market conditions and lack of market liquidity resulted in M&T deciding to transfer $883 million of Alt-A loans previously held for sale ($808 million of first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage loans) to its held-for-investment residential mortgage loan portfolio. As a result, the carrying value of those loans was reduced by $12 million in the recent quarter, resulting in an after-tax reduction of net income of $7 million, or $.07 per diluted share. In addition, M&T accrued $6 million to provide for declines in market value of
Noninterest Income and Expense.

previously sold loans that M&T may be required to repurchase. That accrual reduced M&T's net income in the recent quarter by $4 million, or $.03 per diluted share.
     Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2007 totaled $399 million, compared with $382 million in the similar quarter of 2006. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $18 million in 2007 and $13 million in 2006. The increased amortization reflects M&T's acquisition of 21 branch offices in upstate New York on June 30, 2006. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $381 million in the recently completed quarter and $369 million in the first quarter of 2006. Contributing to the rise in operating expenses in 2007 were higher salaries expenses, reflecting the impact of 2006 acquisitions, primarily the branch office acquisition noted above, annual merit increases, and stock-based and other incentive compensation costs. Also contributing to the increased level of operating expenses was a lower reversal of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $1 million in the recent quarter, compared with $7 million in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding the impact of those reversals, operating expenses in 2007's first quarter were up only 1.6% from the year-earlier period.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 55.1% in the first quarter of 2007, compared with 52.4% in the year-earlier period.
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      M&T had total assets of $57.8 billion at March 31, 2007, up from $55.4 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, rose 6% to $43.5 billion at the recent quarter-end from $40.9 billion at March 31, 2006. Deposits were $38.9 billion at March 31, 2007, compared with $38.2 billion a year earlier. Total stockholders' equity was $6.3 billion and $5.9 billion at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing 10.81% of total assets at the recent quarter-end and 10.68% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $57.32 and $53.11 at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $28.77 at March 31, 2007, compared with $26.41 a year earlier. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Balance Sheet.
     During the first quarter of 2007, M&T repurchased, 1,736,800 shares of common stock under authorized repurchase plans at an average cost of $119.69 per share, including a new plan authorized by M&T's Board of Directors allowing for the purchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock. Under that new plan, M&T repurchased 40,500 shares in the recent quarter at an average cost per share of $116.52.
