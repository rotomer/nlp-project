Exhibit 99.1
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the second quarter of 2007 were $1.95, up from $1.87 in the year-earlier quarter. GAAP-basis net income in the recently completed quarter totaled $214 million, compared with $213 million in the second quarter of 2006. GAAP-basis net income for 2007's second quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.49% and 13.92%, respectively, compared with 1.54% and 14.35%, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2006.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     Reflecting on M&T's financial performance in the recently completed quarter, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, "In contrast to the first quarter, M&T experienced a 3 basis point improvement in our net interest margin and growth in several noninterest income catagories, including mortgage banking revenues that were consistent with our historical performance. In addition to revenue growth, operating expenses continued to be well-controlled."

     For the first six months of 2007, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share were $3.51, compared with $3.64 in the similar 2006 period. On the same basis, net income for the first half of the year totaled $390 million in 2007 and $415 million in 2006. GAAP-basis net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.37% and 12.65%, respectively, compared with 1.52% and 14.16%, respectively, in the similar 2006 period.
      Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $10 million ($.09 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2007, compared with $7 million ($.06 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2006. Similar after tax effect amortization charges for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 were $21 million ($.19 per diluted share) and $15 million ($.13 per diluted share), respectively. The increased amortization in 2007 as compared with the corresponding 2006 periods reflects the June 30, 2006 acquisition of 21 banking offices in Buffalo and Rochester, including $1 billion of deposits and $269 million of

loans. Expenses related to the acquisition and integration of those banking offices, deposits and loans totaled $2 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.02 per diluted share in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2006. There were no similar expenses in 2007.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and banking office acquisition-related expenses, were $2.04 in the recent quarter, up 5% from $1.95 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income during 2007's second quarter was $224 million, compared with $222 million in the corresponding 2006 period. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.65% and 29.35%, respectively, in the recent quarter, compared with 1.69% and 30.02% in the year-earlier quarter.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007 were $3.70, compared with $3.79 in the first six months of 2006. Net operating income for the first half of 2007 was $411 million, compared with $433 million in the similar 2006 period. For the first two quarters of 2007, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.53% and 26.71%, respectively, compared with 1.67% and 29.67% in the first half of 2006.

      Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $467 million in the second quarter of 2007, up 3% from $451 million in the year-earlier period. Growth in average loans and leases, which rose 6% to $43.6 billion in the recent quarter from $41.0 billion in the second quarter of 2006, was the most significant contributor to the improvement. Such growth was attributable to average outstanding balance increases in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans. Net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, was 3.67% in the recent quarter, compared with 3.66% in the corresponding quarter of 2006. The recent quarter's net interest margin was also improved from 3.64% in 2007's initial quarter.

      The provision for credit losses totaled $30 million in the second quarter of 2007, up from $17 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net charge-offs of loans were $22 million during the recent quarter, compared with $10 million in the second quarter of 2006. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .20% and .10% in the second quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. With regard to credit, Mr. Jones noted, "Consistent with our expectations, loan charge-off rates have risen although they are still well below historical norms."
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $296 million, or .68% of total loans at June 30, 2007, compared with $156 million or .38% a year earlier, $224 million or .52% at December 31, 2006 and $273 million or .63% at March 31, 2007. Contributing to the increase in nonperforming loans from March 31, 2007 was the addition of a $34 million loan to a residential home builder and developer in the Mid-Atlantic region. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $135 million at the end of the recent quarter, compared with $101 million at June 30, 2006. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $70 million and $79 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $18 million at June 30, 2007, compared with $14 million a year earlier.
      The allowance for credit losses totaled $668 million, or 1.53% of total loans, at June 30, 2007, compared with $646 million, or 1.55%, a year earlier and $650 million, or 1.51%, at December 31, 2006. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of loans from June 30, 2006 to the recent quarter-end reflects increased holdings of residential

real estate loans in the loan portfolio. In general, M&T experiences lower charge-offs on residential real estate loans than on most other loan types. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 226%, 414% and 290% at June 30, 2007, June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
      Noninterest income in the second quarter of 2007 totaled $283 million, an increase of 8% from $263 million in the year-earlier quarter. Contributing to the increase were higher deposit account service charges, revenues from providing brokerage, trust and corporate advisory services, and $8 million relating to M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group, LLC ("BLG"), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender in which M&T invested on February 5, 2007. Including expenses associated with M&T's investment in BLG, most notably interest expense, that investment added approximately $2 million (after tax effect) to M&T's net income in the second quarter of 2007. BLG specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2007 aggregated $393 million, compared with $377 million in the second quarter of 2006. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million in 2007 and $11 million in 2006, and banking office acquisition-related expenses of $4 million in 2006. The increased amortization and the acquisition-related expenses reflect M&T's June 30, 2006 transaction to acquire 21 banking offices in Western New York. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were

$376 million in the recent quarter, compared with $362 million in the second quarter of 2006. Higher salaries expense in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of 2006 was the largest contributor to the increase in noninterest operating expenses. During the recent quarter, the allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was reduced by $5 million, compared with a similar reversal of $8 million in the second quarter of 2006. Those reversals reduced noninterest operating expenses and resulted from higher interest rate environments at the end of the respective quarters as compared with the immediately preceding quarter-ends.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio improved to 50.2% in the second quarter of 2007 from 50.7% in the year-earlier period.
      M&T had total assets of $57.9 billion at June 30, 2007, up from $56.5 billion at June 30, 2006. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, rose 5% to $43.7 billion at the recent quarter-end from $41.6 billion a year earlier. Deposits were $39.4 billion at June 30, 2007, compared with $38.5 billion at June 30, 2006. Total stockholders' equity was $6.2 billion at June 30, 2007, representing 10.67% of total assets, compared with $6.0 billion or 10.62% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $57.59 and $54.01 at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $28.66 at June 30, 2007, compared with $25.55 at June 30, 2006. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core

deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     During the recent quarter, M&T repurchased 1,978,000 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $109.77 under a plan authorized in February 2007 by M&T's Board of Directors allowing for the purchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock.
