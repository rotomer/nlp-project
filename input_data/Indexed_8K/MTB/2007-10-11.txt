Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the third quarter of 2007 were $1.83, compared with $1.85 in the similar period of 2006. On the same basis, net income in the recent quarter totaled $199 million, compared with $210 million in the third quarter of 2006. GAAP-basis net income for the third quarter of 2007 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.37% and 12.78%, respectively, compared with 1.49% and 13.72%, respectively, in the corresponding 2006 quarter.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     The recent quarter's results include an increase in the provision for credit losses reflecting, in part, higher net charge-offs and nonperforming loans. In addition, M&T's February 2007 investment in Bayview Lending Group, LLC ("BLG") resulted in a reduction of net income of $9 million (after tax effect), or $.09 per diluted share, inclusive of interest expense to fund the investment. BLG's results were impacted by the timing of the recognition of gains from loan sales and securitizations. Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
 
2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION
M&T, observed, "Higher credit costs, slow revenue growth and the impact of our investment in BLG hindered M&T's performance in the recent quarter. We were, however, encouraged with loan growth of more than $1 billion experienced late in the quarter and our continued ability to effectively manage operating expenses."
     For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share totaled $5.34, compared with $5.49 in the year-earlier period. On the same basis, net income for the first three quarters of 2007 was $589 million. In the year earlier period net income was $626 million. GAAP-basis net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.37% and 12.69%, respectively, compared with 1.51% and 14.01%, respectively, in the corresponding nine-month period of 2006.
      M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $10 million ($.09 per diluted share) in the recent quarter, compared with $12 million ($.10 per diluted share) in the third

quarter of 2006. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 were $31 million or $.28 per diluted share and $27 million or $.23 per diluted share, respectively. The after-tax effect of expenses related to the acquisition and integration of branch offices acquired on June 30, 2006 were $1 million during the third quarter of 2006. Such expenses totaled $3 million, after tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2006. There were no similar expenses in 2007.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.92 in the third quarter of 2007, compared with $1.96 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income totaled $209 million and $223 million in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.51% and 26.80%, respectively, in 2007's third quarter, compared with 1.67% and 30.22% in the year-earlier quarter.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 aggregated $5.62, compared with $5.75 in the corresponding period of 2006. Net operating income totaled $620 million for the first nine months of 2007 and $656 million in the similar 2006 period. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity, net operating income for the first three quarters of 2007 was 1.52% and 26.74%, respectively, compared with 1.67% and 29.86% in the first nine months of 2006.

      A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity follows:
Reconciliation of Total Assets and Equity to Tangible Assets and Equity.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $473 million in the third quarter of 2007, up 2% from $462 million in the year-earlier quarter. Growth in average loans and leases, which increased 5% to $43.8 billion in 2007's third quarter from $41.7 billion in the third quarter of 2006, was the largest contributor to the rise. Such growth was largely attributable to increases in average outstanding balances of $803 million or 7% in commercial loans and $862 million or 17% in residential real estate loans. The positive impact of that growth on taxable-equivalent net interest income was offset by a year-over-year decline in the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, of 3 basis points (hundredths of one percent). The net interest margin was 3.65% in
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
2007's third quarter and 3.68% in the corresponding period of 2006. The net interest margin was 3.67% in the second quarter of 2007.
      Reflecting current credit conditions that have contributed to higher net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperforming loans at M&T and throughout the banking industry, M&T's provision for credit losses increased to $34 million in the recent quarter from $17 million in the third quarter of 2006.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
     Net charge-offs of loans during the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 were $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .20% in the recently completed quarter, compared with .16% in the corresponding 2006 period. Loans classified as nonperforming totaled $371 million, or .83% of total loans at the recent quarter-end, up from $180 million or .43% at September 30, 2006, $224 million or .52% at December 31, 2006 and $296 million or .68% of total loans at June 30, 2007. The increase from June 30, 2007 reflects additional loans to residential home builders and developers of approximately $42 million and a $26 million increase in residential real estate loans classified as nonperforming. The higher level of nonperforming residential real estate loans substantially resulted from delinquencies in the portfolio of alternative ("Alt-A") residential mortgage loans transferred to M&T's held-for-investment loan portfolio in March 2007. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $140 million at September 30, 2007, compared with $112 million a year earlier. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $70 million and $76 million, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $22 million at September 30, 2007, up from $14 million a year earlier.

      The allowance for credit losses totaled $680 million, or 1.52% of total loans, at September 30, 2007, compared with $646 million, or 1.54%, a year earlier and $650 million or 1.51% at December 31, 2006. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 183%, 360% and 290% at September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
      Noninterest income in the third quarter of 2007 aggregated $253 million, down 8% from $274 million in the year-earlier quarter. The recent quarter's total includes M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating loss of BLG of $11 million while last year's third quarter reflects the impact of a $13 million gain from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB borrowing assumed in an acquisition. If the BLG operating results and the prior year gain are excluded, noninterest income increased to $264 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $261 million in the year-earlier period, despite a $5 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     As already noted, M&T's investment in BLG reduced M&T's net income in the third quarter of 2007 by approximately $9 million (after tax effect), or $.09 per diluted share. The BLG investment added $8 million to noninterest income and approximately $2 million (after tax effect), or $.02 per diluted share, to M&T's net income in the second quarter of 2007. Results from M&T's investment in BLG fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of loan sales/securitizations conducted by BLG. Through September 30, 2007, M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG reduced noninterest income by $6 million and, including expenses associated with the investment, reduced net income by approximately $10 million, or $.09 per diluted share.

     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2007 totaled $391 million, compared with $409 million in the third quarter of 2006. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006 and acquisition-related expenses of $1 million in 2006 related to M&T's June 30, 2006 transaction to acquire 21 banking offices in Western New York. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $375 million in the recent quarter, compared with $388 million in the third quarter of 2006. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2006 reflected an $18 million charitable contribution made by M&T Bank, M&T's principal banking subsidiary, to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt private charitable foundation, and a $5 million addition to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights. There were no similar expenses in the third quarter of 2007.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 51.6% in the third quarter of 2007, compared with 52.8% in the year-earlier period.
      M&T had total assets of $60.0 billion at September 30, 2007, up from $56.4 billion at September 30, 2006. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, rose 6% to $44.8 billion at September 30, 2007 from $42.1 billion a year earlier. Deposits aggregated $38.5 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $39.1 billion at September 30, 2006. Total stockholders' equity was $6.2 billion at each of September 30, 2007 and 2006, representing 10.40% and 10.91%, respectively, of total assets.
Balance Sheet.
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
Common stockholders' equity per share was $58.40 and $55.58 at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $29.48 at September 30, 2007, compared with $27.15 at September 30, 2006. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.1 billion at each of September 30, 2007 and 2006.
     During the recent quarter, M&T repurchased 675,000 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $105.28 under a plan authorized in February 2007 by M&T's Board of Directors allowing for the purchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2007 M&T repurchased 4,389,800 shares of its common stock pursuant to authorized repurchase plans at an average cost of $113.00 per share.
     As previously announced, M&T has entered into a definitive agreement with Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. ("Partners Trust"), Utica, New York, providing for a merger between the two companies. As of June 30, 2007, Partners Trust had approximately $3.7 billion of assets, including $2.3 billion of loans, and $3.2 billion of liabilities, including $2.3 billion of deposits. The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of various state and Federal regulators and Partners Trust's stockholders, and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, in September 2007 M&T Bank announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with First Horizon National Corp. ("First Horizon") to acquire First Horizon's 13-branch Mid-Atlantic franchise. Ten of the branches are located in the Greater Washington region and three are in the Greater Baltimore area. M&T Bank will acquire approximately $226 million in loans, $201 million in deposits and $136 million in
