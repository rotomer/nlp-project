     (e) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Trust Preferred Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Guarantor promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

     (k) The Guarantor will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Guarantor to facilitate the sale or resale of the Trust Preferred Securities.

Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Guarantor and the Trust will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Trust Preferred Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Trust Preferred Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any
provided
however
 
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Trust Preferred Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Guarantor and the Trust against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Trust Preferred Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Trust Preferred Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto.

     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
 
indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) shall not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such
provided
however
 
request prior to the date of such settlement. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then the Guarantor and the Trust and the Underwriters severally shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, then the Guarantor and the Trust and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Guarantor and the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case, as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Gurantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties, and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
 
investigating or defending the same. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (i) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Trust Preferred Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and not joint. For purposes of this Section 7(d), each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Guarantor or the Trust who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Guarantor or the Trust shall have the same rights to contribution as the Guarantor or the Trust, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this subsection (d).
     (e) The obligations of the Guarantor and the Trust under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Guarantor or the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of each Underwriter and to each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of the Guarantor or the Trust and to each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Guarantor or the Trust and the Underwriters in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of an Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Guarantor or the Trust, its directors or officers, any authorized representative of the Guarantor or the Trust or any person controlling the Guarantor or the Trust, and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Trust Preferred Securities.
          8. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Guarantor prior to delivery of and payment for the Trust Preferred Securities, if at any time prior to such
Termination
 
delivery and payment (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
          9. . If any one or more Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Trust Preferred Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for the Trust Preferred Securities (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities set forth opposite their names on Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities set forth opposite the names of all remaining Underwriters) which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Trust Preferred Securities set forth on Schedule II hereto, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Trust Preferred Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of the Trust Preferred Securities, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor or the Trust, except for the expenses to be borne by the Guarantor or the Trust and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default by an Underwriter
          10. . The respective agreements, indemnities, representations, warranties, and other statements of the Guarantor or the Trust and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, or any officer or director or controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Guarantor or the Trust, or any officer or director or controlling person
Representations, Warranties and Indemnities to Survive
 
of the Guarantor or the Trust, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Trust Preferred Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 11 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
          11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Guarantor and the Trust shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities, except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof; but if for any other reason the Trust Preferred Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Guarantor and the Trust as provided herein, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, resale and delivery of such Trust Preferred Securities, but the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Trust Preferred Securities except as provided in Sections 5 and Section 7 hereof.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee
provided, however
 
from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect) and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.

If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto that set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph.

If, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail services or for any other reason, it shall be impossible or impracticable to mail notice of any event to Holders when said notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture or of the relevant Securities, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms as such temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.

Global Securities.
     (a) Each Global Security issued under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated by the Company for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
     (b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (i) such Depositary advises the Trustee in writing that such Depositary is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities as Depositary with respect to such Global Security, and the Company is unable to locate a qualified successor within 90 days of receipt of such notice from the Depositary, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order stating that the Company elects to terminate the bookentry system through the Depositary, or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default.
     (c) If any Global Security is to be exchanged for other Securities or cancelled in whole, it shall be surrendered by or on behalf of the Depositary or its nominee to the Securities Registrar for exchange or cancellation as provided in this Article III. If any Global Security is to be exchanged for other Securities or cancelled in part, or if another Security is to be exchanged in whole or in part for a beneficial interest in any Global Security, then either (i) such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or cancellation as provided in this Article III or
 
(ii) the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, or increased by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged or cancelled, or equal to the principal amount of such other Security to be so exchanged for a beneficial interest therein, as the case may be, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Securities Registrar, whereupon the Trustee, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, shall instruct the Depositary or its authorized representative to make a corresponding adjustment to its records. Upon any such surrender or adjustment of a Global Security by the Depositary, accompanied by registration instructions, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 3.6(b) and as otherwise provided in this Article III, authenticate and deliver any Securities issuable in exchange for such Global Security (or any portion thereof) in accordance with the instructions of the Depositary. The Trustee shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such instructions.
     (d) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Article III, Section 9.6 or 11.6 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
     (e) The Depositary or its nominee, as the registered owner of a Global Security, shall be the Holder of such Global Security for all purposes under this Indenture and the Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security shall hold such interests pursuant to the Applicable Procedures. Accordingly, any such owner's beneficial interest in a Global Security shall be shown only on, and the transfer of such interest shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee or agent. Neither the Trustee nor the Securities Registrar shall have any liability in respect of any transfers effected by the Depositary.
     (f) The rights of owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such owners and the Depositary and/or its Agent Members.

Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest
 
shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (ii).

Section 5.2.
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     (a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then, and in every such case, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), that, in the case of the Securities of a series issued to an Issuer Trust, if, upon an Event of Default, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
provided, however
 
Outstanding Securities of such series fail to declare the principal of all the Outstanding Securities of such series to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the related Trust Agreement) of the related series of Capital Securities issued by such Issuer Trust then outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified portion thereof) of and the accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) on all the Securities of such series shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of such series (or, if the Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms of that series) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. Payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIII notwithstanding that such amount shall become immediately due and payable as herein provided.
     (b) At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (i) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
     (A) all overdue installments of interest on all Securities of such series;
     (B) any accrued Additional Interest on all Securities of such series;
     (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of such series that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities; and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
     (ii) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
     (c) In the case of Securities of a series initially issued to an Issuer Trust, if the Holders of such Securities fail to annul such declaration and waive such default, the holders of a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the related Trust Agreement) of the related series of Capital Securities issued by such Issuer Trust then outstanding shall also have the right to rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences by written notice to the
 
Company and the Trustee, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above of this Section 5.2.
     (d) No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.3
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     (a) The Company covenants that if:
     (i) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days or
     (ii) default is made in the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Security at the Stated Maturity thereof,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest), and, in addition thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee under Section 6.7.
     (b) If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
     (c) If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 5.4.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial or administrative proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors,
     (a) the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective
 
of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal (and premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest)) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) owing and unpaid in respect to the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable and to take any and all actions as are authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have the claims of the Holders and any predecessor to the Trustee under Section 6.7 allowed in any such judicial or administrative proceedings; and
     (ii) in particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 5.6; and
     (b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, conservator (or other similar official) in any such judicial or administrative proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee for distribution in accordance with Section 5.6, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
provided, however,

     THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company.
Section 5.7.
Limitation on Suits.
     Subject to Section 5.8, no Holder of any Securities of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
     (a) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
     (b) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
     (c) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;

     (e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
 
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security of any series shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 3.8 and 3.12) interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

     If the Trustee, any Holder or any holder of Capital Securities issued by any Issuer Trust has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee, such Holder or such holder of Capital Securities, then, and in every such case, the Company, the Trustee, such Holders and such holder of Capital Securities shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee, such Holder and such holder of Capital Securities shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 5.10.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 3.7, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     (a) No delay or omission of the Trustee, any Holder of any Security with respect to the Securities of the related series or any holder of any Capital Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the related series shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
 
     (b) Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders and the right and remedy given to the holders of Capital Securities by Section 5.8 may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee, the Holders or the holders of Capital Securities, as the case may be.

provided that
     (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
     (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction, and
     (c) subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee shall, in good faith, determine that the proceeding so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders not joining in any such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
Section 5.13.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
     (a) The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series affected thereby and, in the case of any Securities of a series initially issued to an Issuer Trust, the holders of a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the related Trust Agreement) of the Capital Securities issued by such Issuer Trust may waive any past default hereunder and its consequences with respect to such series except a default:
     (i) in the payment of the principal (or premium, if any) of or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security of such series (unless such default has been cured and the Company has paid to or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest (including Additional Interest) and all principal of (and premium, if any, on) all Securities of that series due otherwise than by acceleration), or
     (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of any Outstanding Security of such series affected thereby.
     (b) Any such waiver shall be deemed to be on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, or in the case of waiver by holders of Capital Securities issued by such Issuer Trust, by all holders of Capital Securities issued by such Issuer Trust.
 
     (c) Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may, in its discretion, assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant, but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security.
Section 5.15.
Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws.
     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

     (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture, but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations stated therein).
     (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
     (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct except that:
     (i) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section;
     (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

in the Securities Register, notice of such default, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of Securities of such series; and that, in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 5.1(c), no such notice to Holders of Securities of such series shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.

Commencing not later than the earlier of (i) the first Interest Payment Date following the commencement of any Deferral Period on which the Company pays any current interest on the JSDs from any source of funds or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period, the Company shall, subject to the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event or a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.7(b) and subject to Section 2.5(c), issue one or more types of Qualifying APM Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the JSDs and applied such Eligible Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest in accordance with Section 2.5, that:
Obligation to Issue Qualifying APM Securities
provided
               (i) the foregoing obligations will not apply to the extent that, with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of any Deferral Period, the net proceeds of any issuance of Common Stock (or Qualifying Warrants if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been modified to exclude Common Stock) applied during such Deferral Period to pay interest on the JSDs pursuant to this Section 2.7, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Common Stock and Qualifying Warrants so applied during such Deferral Period, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the product of the average of the Current Stock Market Prices of the Common Stock on the 10 consecutive Trading Days ending on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the date of issuance multiplied by the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements (the ""); that the Common Equity

The Company may, at its discretion and without the consent of the Holders of the JSDs, increase the Maximum Share Number (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) if it determines that such increase is necessary to allow it to issue sufficient Common Stock to pay deferred interest on the JSDs
Maximum Share Number
          For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once the Company reaches the Common Equity Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company will (subject to the proviso in Section 2.7 (a)(i)) not be required to issue more Common Stock (or Qualifying Warrants if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been modified to exclude Common Stock) with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of such Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 2.7, even if the amount referred to in clause (i) of this Section 2.7 subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the Current Stock Market Price of Common Stock or the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (y) so long as the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has not been amended to eliminate Common Stock, the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Company's sole discretion and the Company is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the JSDs, and no class of investors of the Company's securities, or any other party, may require the Company to issue Qualifying Warrants.
          (b) . Section 2.7(a) will not apply with respect to any Interest Payment Date if the Company shall have provided to the Trustee (and to the Property Trustee of the Trust to the extent the Trust is the sole Holder of the JSDs) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days before such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (x) the Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (y) the Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event continued for only

part of such period but the Company was unable to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest due on the Interest Payment Date with respect to which such Officers' Certificate is being delivered or (z) the Supervisory Event prevents the Company from applying the net proceeds of sales of Qualifying APM Securities to pay deferred interest on such Interest Payment Date.
          (c) .
Partial Payment of Deferred Interest
               (i) If the Company has raised some but not all Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date pursuant to this Section 2.7, such Eligible Proceeds will be allocated to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, and payment on each installment of deferred interest will be distributed to Holders of such installment on a basis.
pro rata
               (ii) If the Company has outstanding Parity Securities under which the Company is obligated to sell securities that are Qualifying APM Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions will be applied to the JSDs and those other Parity Securities on a basis up to the Maximum Share Number, the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing those other Parity Securities, with respect to payments on these instruments) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the JSDs and such other Parity Securities, or on such other basis as the Federal Reserve may approve. The Company may make such payments on such Parity Securities so long as it shall have paid or deposited with the Paying Agent for the JSDs or segregated and holds in trust for payment the amount of deferred interest payable on the JSDs.

The Company will notify the Trust of the Make-Whole Redemption Price (if applicable) promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trust will have no responsibility for calculating the Make-Whole Redemption Price. The Company may not redeem the JSDs in part if the principal amount of the JSDs has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded unless all accrued and unpaid interest including deferred interest has been paid in full on all outstanding JSDs for all Interest Periods terminating on or before the Redemption Date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days before the redemption date to each holder of JSDs to be redeemed at its registered address.

Interest shall be payable (i) quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2008 (each such date, an ""), at the rate of 8.500% , from and including January 31, 2008 (computed on the basis of (i) a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months with respect to any Interest Period), plus Additional Interest, if any. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.5 of the Supplemental Indenture, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the then-applicable rate described in the second sentence of this paragraph, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.

The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which will be the date that is the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which such Interest Payment Date falls (whether or not a Business Day). Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for (other than interest deferred in accordance with the next paragraph) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof will be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days before such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

                    So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company has the right at any time or from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive Interest Periods up to 10 years; that no Deferral Period will extend beyond the Maturity Date, the date of an Event of Default, or the earlier redemption of any Securities of this series. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements.

Accordingly:
     (i) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative and will accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Issuer Trust available for the payment of Distributions. Distributions shall accumulate from January 31, 2008, and, except in the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right to defer the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2008. If any date on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such
 
Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which such payment was originally payable.
     (ii) In the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right under the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures, Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be deferred but shall continue to accumulate. Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be payable on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities at the rate equal to the rate of interest on the Debentures. The amount of Distributions payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include any Additional Amounts in respect of such period.
per annum
     (iii) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions.
     (b) Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities at the close of business on the relevant record date, which shall be the Business Day prior to the relevant Distribution Date; provided that if the Trust Securities are not in Global form, the relevant record date shall be the date 15 days prior to the relevant Distribution Date. Distributions payable on any Trust Securities that are not punctually paid on an applicable Distribution Date will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such deferred or defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date for determining Holders entitled to such deferred or defaulted Distributions.
Section 4.2.

     (a) On each Debenture Redemption Date, the Issuer Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price.
     (b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register; provided that the Depositor shall give the Property Trustee at least 15 days prior notice of such mailing. All notices of redemption shall state:
     (i) the Redemption Date;
     (ii) the Redemption Price, or if the Redemption Price cannot be calculated prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, the estimate of the Redemption Price provided pursuant to the Indenture together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be
 
sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, that notice of such actual Redemption Price is received pursuant to the Indenture);
     (iii) the CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers of the Capital Securities affected;
     (iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and the total Liquidation Amount of the particular Trust Securities to be redeemed;
     (v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accumulate on and after said date, except as provided in Section 4.2(d) below; and
     (vi) the place or places where Trust Securities are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price..
     The Issuer Trust in issuing the Trust Securities shall use "CUSIP" numbers, and the Property Trustee shall indicate the "CUSIP" numbers of the Trust Securities in notices of redemption and related materials as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Trust Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and related material.
provided
     (c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the applicable proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Junior Subordinated Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price.
     (d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Capital Securities held in global form, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not held in global form, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then, upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distributions payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption
 
Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be Outstanding. In the event that any date on which any applicable Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the applicable Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such applicable Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price.
     (e) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, the Property Trustee will select the particular Trust Securities to be redeemed on a pro rata basis not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate.

provided, however
     (b) In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from any Debenture Event of Default, the Holder of the Common Securities shall be deemed to have waived any right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effects of all such Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all such Events of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Capital Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities
 
and not on behalf of the Holder of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf.

     If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall be surrendered to the Securities Registrar, or if the Securities Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Securities Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Securities Registrar and the Administrators such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser or a protected purchaser, the Administrators, or any one of them, on behalf of the Issuer Trust shall execute and make available for delivery, and the Property Trustee shall authenticate, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrators or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust corresponding to that evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time.
Section 5.7.
Persons Deemed Holders.
     The Issuer Trustees, the Administrators, the Securities Registrar or the Depositor shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities are registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities for the purpose of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Issuer Trustees, the Administrators, the Securities Registrar nor the Depositor shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.
Section 5.8.
Access to List of Holders' Names and Addresses.
     Each Holder and each Owner shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Depositor, the Property Trustee, or the Administrators accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.
Section 5.9.
Maintenance of Office or Agency.
     The Property Trustee shall designate, with the consent of the Administrators, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Capital Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer Trustees in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Property Trustee initially designates its Corporate Trust Office, at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, as its corporate trust office for such purposes. The Property Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor, the Administrators and the Holders of any change in the location of the Securities Register or any such office or agency.
 
Section 5.10.
Appointment of Paying Agent.
     The Paying Agent shall make Distributions to Holders from the Payment Account and shall report the amounts of such Distributions to the Property Trustee and the Administrators. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account solely for the purpose of making the Distributions referred to above. The Property Trustee may revoke such power and remove any Paying Agent in its sole discretion. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Property Trustee. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrators and the Property Trustee. In the event that the Property Trustee shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Property Trustee shall appoint a successor (which shall be a bank or trust company) that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrators to act as Paying Agent. Such successor Paying Agent appointed by the Property Trustee, or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Administrators, shall execute and deliver to the Issuer Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Holders in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.6 herein shall apply to the Bank also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the Bank shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Trust Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent chosen by the Property Trustee unless the context requires otherwise.
Section 5.11.
Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor.
     At each Time of Delivery, the Depositor shall acquire and retain beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities except (a) in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Depositor into another corporation or any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Depositor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Indenture, or (b) a transfer to an Affiliate of the Depositor in compliance with applicable law (including the Securities Act and applicable state securities and blue sky laws). To the fullest extent permitted by law, any other attempted transfer of the Common Securities shall be void. The Administrators shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT TO A SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO THE DEPOSITOR OR AN AFFILIATE OF THE DEPOSITOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND SECTION 5.11 OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT."
Section 5.12.
Notices to Clearing Agency.
     To the extent that a notice or other communication to the Holders is required under this Trust Agreement, for so long as Capital Securities are represented by a Global Capital Securities Certificate, the Administrators and the Issuer Trustees shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligations to the Owners.
 
Section 5.13.
Rights of Holders.
     (a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Issuer Trust and shall be held and administered by the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Issuer Trust. Subject to Section 4.8 hereof, the Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails, or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures fail, to declare the principal of all of the Junior Subordinated Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have such right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as provided in the Indenture, the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
     (A) all overdue installments of interest on all of the Junior Subordinated Debentures,
     (B) any accrued Additional Interest on all of the Junior Subordinated Debentures,
     (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Junior Subordinated Debentures which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Junior Subordinated Debentures, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and
 
     (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Junior Subordinated Debentures which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture.
     The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures affected thereby. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Capital Securities all or part of which is represented by Global Capital Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; , that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.13(b).
provided
     (c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon (i) the breach by the Depositor of its obligations under Section 2.7(a) of the Supplemental Indenture to issue Qualifying APM Securities (as defined therein) or (ii) upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 2.9(a) of the Supplemental Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Supplemental Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal amount of or interest on Junior Subordinated Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a). Except as set forth in Sections 5.13(b) and 5.13(c) of this Trust Agreement, the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Junior Subordinated Debentures.
"Direct Action"
     (d) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5.13(a), (b) and (c), the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and
 
any default or Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.1.
Limitations on Holder's Voting Rights.
     (a) Except as provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as members of an association.
     (b) So long as any Junior Subordinated Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the Property Trustee shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to such Junior Subordinated Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Junior Subordinated Debentures shall be due and payable, or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Junior Subordinated Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Property Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action will not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.
provided, however,
     (c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trust otherwise proposes to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the interests, powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Trust Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other
 
provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.
Section 6.2.
Notice of Meetings.
     Notice of all meetings of the Holders, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Holder of record, at his registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.
Section 6.3.
Meetings of Holders.
     (a) No annual meeting of Holders is required to be held. The Property Trustee, however, shall call a meeting of Holders to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Holders of record of 25% of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities and the Administrators or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of Holders of Capital Securities to vote on any matters as to which Holders are entitled to vote.
     (b) Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Holders of Capital Securities.
     (c) If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding Capital Securities representing at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities held by the Holders present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of Capital Securities, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
Section 6.4.
Voting Rights.
     Holders shall be entitled to one vote for each $25 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Outstanding Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Holders are entitled to vote.
Section 6.5.
Proxies, etc.
     At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Issuer Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be
provided
 
deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
Section 6.6.
Holder Action by Written Consent.
     Any action which may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all Trust Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing.
Section 6.7.
Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
     For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any Distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrators or the Property Trustee may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
Section 6.8.
Acts of Holders.
     (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
"Act"
     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which any Issuer Trustee or Administrator receiving the same deems sufficient.
     (c) The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
 
     (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, the Administrators or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
     (e) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.
     (f) If any dispute shall arise among the Holders, the Administrators or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.
Section 6.9.
Inspection of Records.
     Upon reasonable notice to the Administrators and the Property Trustee, the records of the Issuer Trust shall be open to inspection by Holders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Holder's interest as a Holder.
     (a) The Property Trustee, hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Depositor and the Holders that:

     (3) The execution, delivery and performance of this Trust Agreement by the Property Trustee does not conflict with or constitute a breach of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Property Trustee.
     (4) At the Time of Delivery, the Property Trustee has not knowingly created any Liens or encumbrances on the Trust Securities.
     (5) No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration with or notice to, any New York State or federal banking authority is required for the execution, delivery or performance by the Property Trustee, of this Trust Agreement.
     (b) The Delaware Trustee hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Depositor and the Holders that:
     (1) The Delaware Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with trust power and authority to execute and deliver, and to carry out and perform its obligations under the terms of, the Trust Agreement.
     (2) The execution, delivery and performance by the Delaware Trustee of this Trust Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Delaware Trustee; and this Trust Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Delaware Trustee, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Delaware Trustee, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, insolvency, and other similar laws affecting creditors' right generally and to general principles of equity and the discretion of the court (regardless of whether the enforcement of such remedies is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     (3) The execution, delivery and performance of this Trust Agreement by the Delaware Trustee does not conflict with or constitute a breach of the articles of association or bylaws of the Delaware Trustee.

     The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that:
     (a) the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Time of Delivery on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been duly and validly executed, and, subject to payment therefor, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement, and the Holders will be, as of each such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and
 
     (b) there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Issuer Trust (or the Issuer Trustees on behalf of the Issuer Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by either the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, of this Trust Agreement.
Section 8.1.
Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
     (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees and the Administrators shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Issuer Trustees or the Administrators to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it or them. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees or the Administrators shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrator or the Issuer Trustees from liability for his or its own negligent action, his or its own negligent failure to act, or his or its own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Issuer Trustee or Administrator has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Issuer Trustee or Administrator shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Issuer Trustee's or Administrator's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees and Administrators otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees and Administrators.
     (b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by his or its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that he or it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it or him as herein provided and that neither the Issuer Trustees nor the Administrators are personally liable to it or him for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
     (c) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the
 
Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.13 of the Indenture), the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders and shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
     (d) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     (i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
     (A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and
     (B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Trust Agreement;
     (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
     (iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement;
     (iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Junior Subordinated Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
     (v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money
 
held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
     (vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrators or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, the Administrators or the Depositor; and
     (vii) no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     (e) The Administrators shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrator be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Administrator, the Issuer Trustees or the Depositor.
Section 8.2.
Certain Notices.
     (a) Within five Business Days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders and the Administrators, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
     (b) Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders and the Administrators, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
Section 8.3.
