     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the second quarter of 2008 were $1.44, compared with $1.95 in the year-earlier quarter. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter aggregated $160 million, compared with $214 million in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP-basis net income for 2008's second quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was .98% and 9.96%, respectively, compared with 1.49% and 13.92%, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2007.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     Commenting on M&T's results for the recent quarter, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, observed, "While M&T is not immune to the effects of the higher credit costs evident throughout the banking industry as we move through the current credit cycle, we, nevertheless, recorded significant profits during the quarter. The combination of growth in loans and deposits, a stable net interest margin, core noninterest income growth and controlled expense levels demonstrate the strength of our organization amid a challenging environment. Our focus is to continue to prudently provide credit and other banking services to our customers throughout the
 
2-2-2-2-2 M&T BANK CORPORATION
current economic cycle while using our capital generation ability to strengthen our already sound capital position."
     For the first half of 2008, GAAP-basis diluted earnings per share were $3.26, compared with $3.51 in the first six months of 2007. On the same basis, net income for the first two quarters of the year totaled $362 million in 2008 and $390 million in 2007. GAAP-basis net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was 1.12% and 11.23%, respectively, compared with 1.37% and 12.65%, respectively, in the similar 2007 period.
      M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $10 million ($.09 per diluted share) in each of the second quarters of 2008 and 2007. Similar after tax effect amortization charges were $21 million ($.19 per diluted share) for each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. Merger and integration-related expenses during the first three months of 2008 related to acquisition transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 totaled $2 million, after tax effect, or $.02 of diluted earnings

per share. There were no similar expenses in either the second quarter of 2008 or during the first six months of 2007.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.53 in 2008's second quarter, compared with $2.04 in the year-earlier quarter. Net operating income during the recently completed quarter was $170 million, compared with $224 million in the second quarter of 2007. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, net operating income was 1.10% and 22.20%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2008, compared with 1.65% and 29.35% in the year-earlier quarter.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 were $3.47, compared with $3.70 in the first half of 2007. Net operating income for the first six months of 2008 was $386 million, compared with $411 million in the corresponding 2007 period. For the first six months of 2008, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible equity was 1.25% and 25.04%, respectively, compared with 1.53% and 26.71% in the first two quarters of 2007.

      Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $492 million in the second quarter of 2008, up 5% from $467 million in the year-earlier period. Growth in average loans and leases, which rose 14% to $49.5 billion in the recent quarter from $43.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007, was the most significant contributor to the improvement. Such growth was predominantly attributable to average outstanding balance increases in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans and includes the impact of the loans added in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of acquisitions. Partially offsetting the favorable impact of loan growth was a lower net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, which declined to 3.39% in the recent quarter from 3.67%
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
 
6-6-6-6-6 M&T BANK CORPORATION
in the second quarter of 2007. That narrowing of the net interest margin was attributable to several factors, including the impact of the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition transactions and the issuances of subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of 2007 and Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities in the initial 2008 quarter. The recent quarter's net interest margin was improved slightly from 3.38% in the first quarter of 2008.
      The provision for credit losses increased to $100 million in the second quarter of 2008 from $30 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net charge-offs of loans totaled $99 million during the recent quarter, up from $22 million in the second quarter of 2007. That increase reflects the unfavorable conditions in the residential real estate marketplace that have resulted in declining real estate valuations and affected the ability of individual homeowners and builders and developers of residential real estate properties to repay loans. As a result, the levels of charge-offs and delinquencies have risen significantly as compared with the second quarter of 2007. Specifically, $38 million of the net charge-offs recorded in the recent quarter were related to loans to builders and developers of residential real estate, while there were no such loans charged off in the year-earlier quarter and just $3 million in the first quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs of residential real estate loans to individuals, consisting predominantly of Alt-A residential mortgage loans, aggregated $13 million in the recent quarter, up from $2 million in the comparable quarter of 2007, but down from $15 million in 2008's initial quarter. Net charge-offs of home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $9 million in the recent quarter, and included $5 million related to Alt-A second mortgage loans. Net charge-offs of home equity loans and lines of credit were $2 million in 2007's second quarter and $6 million in 2008's initial quarter.

Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .81% and .20% in the second quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     Loans classified as nonperforming increased to $587 million, or 1.20% of total loans at June 30, 2008 from $296 million or .68% a year earlier, $447 million or .93% at December 31, 2007 and $495 million or 1.00% at March 31, 2008. Significant factors contributing to the jump in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2008 were a $139 million rise in residential real estate loans and a $124 million increase in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The higher level of nonperforming residential real estate loans reflects a December 2007 change in accounting procedure whereby residential real estate loans previously classified as nonaccrual when payments were 180 days past due now stop accruing interest when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days. The impact of the acceleration of the classification of such loans as nonaccrual resulted in an increase in nonperforming loans at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 of $65 million and $84 million, respectively. Contributing to the increase in nonperforming loans from March 31, 2008 was the addition of $67 million of loans to residential real estate builders and developers, including $41 million of loans to residential home builders and developers in the Mid-Atlantic region.
     Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $94 million at the end of the recent quarter, compared with $135 million at June 30, 2007. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $89 million and $70 million at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $53 million at June 30, 2008, compared with $18 million
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
at June 30, 2007. The rise in such assets from a year earlier resulted from higher residential real estate loan defaults.
      The allowance for credit losses was $774 million, or 1.58% of total loans, at June 30, 2008, compared with $668 million, or 1.53%, a year earlier and $759 million, or 1.58%, at December 31, 2007. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans from June 30, 2007 to the 2007 year-end and to the end of the second quarter of 2008 reflects the impact of lower valuations of residential real estate and higher levels of borrower delinquencies. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 132%, 226% and 170% at June 30, 2008, June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses
.
      Noninterest income in the second quarter of 2008 totaled $271 million, compared with $283 million in the year-earlier quarter. Higher service charges on deposit accounts, increases in revenues for providing mortgage banking and trust services, and higher credit-related fees were more than offset by a $21 million decline in M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group, LLC ("BLG"), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender in which M&T invested on February 5, 2007. Including expenses associated with M&T's investment in BLG, most notably interest expense, that investment reduced M&T's net income by approximately $10 million (after tax effect) in the second quarter of 2008. BLG specializes in originating, securitizing and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans. The decline in M&T's share of BLG's operating results was primarily due to lower gains from securitizations resulting from significant disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and higher expenses for severance and lease terminations. In response to the

stagnant market conditions of recent months, BLG has reduced its originations activities, scaled back its workforce and begun using its contingent liquidity sources.
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2008 aggregated $420 million, compared with $393 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $17 million in 2008 and $16 million in 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $403 million in the recent quarter, compared with $376 million in the second quarter of 2007. Increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services and foreclosed residential real estate properties contributed to that rise. During the recent quarter, the allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was reduced by $9 million, compared with a similar reduction of $5 million in the second quarter of 2007. Those reversals reduced noninterest operating expenses and resulted from higher mortgage interest rates at the end of the respective quarters as compared with the immediately preceding quarter-ends.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 52.4in 2008's second quarter, compared with 50.2% in the year-earlier period.

      M&T had total assets of $65.9 billion at June 30, 2008, up from $57.9 billion at June 30, 2007. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, rose 12to $49.1 billion at the recent quarter-end from $43.7 billion a year earlier. Deposits

were $41.9 billion at June 30, 2008, compared with $39.4 billion at June 30, 2007. Total stockholders' equity was $6.5 billion at June 30, 2008, representing 9.89% of total assets, compared with $6.2 billion or 10.67% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity per share was $59.12 and $57.59 at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $28.50 at June 30, 2008, compared with $28.66 at June 30, 2007. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
