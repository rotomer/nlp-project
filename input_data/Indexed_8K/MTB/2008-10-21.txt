Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
      Diluted earnings per share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the third quarter of 2008 were $.82. On the same basis, net income in the recent quarter totaled $91 million. GAAP-basis net income for 2008's third quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was .56% and 5.66%, respectively.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     As previously disclosed in M&T's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 12, 2008, a non-cash charge for other-than-temporary impairment of the value of preferred stock holdings of the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") was recognized in the recent quarter. That charge reduced net income and diluted earnings per share by $97 million and $.88, respectively.
     Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Our third quarter results are just what you would expect from M&T, steady performance during times of economic

turmoil. We continued to experience growth in our core deposits, which increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. That growth was particularly strong during September, when markets were significantly disrupted. Our interest margin remained stable as compared with the first two quarters of 2008. Nonperforming loans trended higher during the recent quarter, even though net charge-offs of loans were down slightly. Both remain at manageable levels. Most notable is the continued improvement of our regulatory capital ratios, which reflects the strength of our operating model and allows us to continue to invest and lend in the communities we serve."
     In September, M&T resolved certain tax issues related to its activities in various jurisdictions that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $40 million in the recent quarter, thereby adding $.36 to diluted earnings per share.
     Diluted earnings per share were $1.83 and $1.44 in the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008, respectively. Net income for those respective quarters was $199 million and $160 million.
      M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors

understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $10 million ($.09 per diluted share) in each of the quarters ended September 30, 2008, June 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007. There were no merger and integration-related expenses incurred during those quarters.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share and net operating income, which exclude amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $.91 and $101 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2008. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity, that net operating income was .65% and 13.17%, respectively.
     Diluted net operating earnings per share totaled $1.92 in 2007's third quarter and $1.53 in the second quarter of 2008. Net operating income was $209 million and $170 million in those respective quarters.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $493 million in the third quarter of 2008, 4% higher than $473 million in the year-earlier period. Growth in average loans and leases, which rose 11% to $48.5 billion in 2008's third quarter from $43.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007, was the most significant contributor to the improvement. Such growth was attributable to increases in average outstanding balances in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans, and includes the impact of loans added in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of acquisitions. Also noteworthy was a 7% increase in average deposits, including a 12% rise in core deposits, from the third quarter of 2007 to the recent quarter. The growth in deposits also reflects the

impact of the late - 2007 acquisitions. The favorable effect of higher loans and deposits on taxable-equivalent net interest income was partially offset by a year-over-year narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, which declined 26 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.39% in 2008's third quarter from 3.65% in the corresponding period of 2007. Nevertheless, M&T's net interest margin in the recent quarter was unchanged from 2008's second quarter, when taxable-equivalent net interest income was $492 million.
      The provision for credit losses was $101 million in the third quarter of 2008 and exceeded net charge-offs by $7 million. That was comparable to the $100 million provision in the second quarter of 2008, but was up from $34 million in the third quarter of 2007. Net charge-offs of loans totaled $94 million during the recent quarter, compared with $99 million in 2008's second quarter and $22 million in the third quarter of 2007. Contributing to the increase in net charge-offs as compared with the year-earlier quarter were $33 million recorded in the recent quarter related to loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. There were $38 million of such loans charged off in the second quarter of 2008, while in 2007's third quarter there were no such loans charged off. Net charge-offs of loans collateralized by first or second liens on residential real estate totaled $23 million during the recent quarter, compared with $21 million and $8 million in the quarters ended June 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Alt-A loans included in those net charge-offs were $15 million in each of the quarters ended September 30, 2008 and June 30, 2008, and $5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2007. Indirect automobile loan net charge-offs were $13 million in the recent quarter, compared with $11 million and $7 million in the second quarter of 2008 and the third 2007

quarter, respectively. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .77%, .81% and .20% in the quarters ended September 30, 2008, June 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively.
     Loans classified as nonperforming rose to $710 million, or 1.46% of total loans at September 30, 2008 from $371 million or .83% a year earlier, $447 million or .93% at December 31, 2007 and $587 million or 1.20% at June 30, 2008. Factors contributing to the rise in nonperforming loans from September 30, 2007 to September 30, 2008 were a $156 million increase in residential real estate loans and a $100 million increase in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The higher level of nonperforming residential real estate loans reflects a December 2007 change in accounting procedure whereby residential real estate loans previously classified as nonaccrual when payments were 180 days past due now stop accruing interest when payments become 90 days delinquent. The acceleration of the classification of such loans as nonaccrual increased nonperforming loans at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 by $72 million and $84 million, respectively. Contributing to the increase in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2008 were the net additions of $64 million of commercial real estate loans (including $19 million of loans to residential real estate builders and developers) and $42 million of residential real estate loans.
     Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $96 million at the end of the recent quarter, compared with $140 million a year earlier. Included in these past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $90 million and $70 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007,

respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $76 million at September 30, 2008, up from $22 million at September 30, 2007. The rise in such assets resulted from higher residential real estate loan defaults and recent quarter additions from residential real estate development projects.
      The allowance for credit losses was $781 million, or 1.60% of total loans, at September 30, 2008, up from $680 million, or 1.52%, a year earlier, and $759 million, or 1.58%, at December 31, 2007. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans reflects the impact of lower valuations of residential real estate and higher levels of borrower delinquencies. Reflecting the value of collateral securing M&T's nonperforming loans, the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 110%, 183% and 170% at September 30, 2008, September 30, 2007, and December 31, 2007, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses
.
      Noninterest income in the third quarter of 2008 aggregated $114 million, compared with $253 million in the year-earlier quarter. The recent quarter's total reflects the non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment charge of $153 million (pre-tax) related to M&T's holdings of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Excluding that charge, other income in 2008's third quarter was $266 million, or 5% higher than in the year-earlier quarter. That improvement was largely attributable to higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts and credit-related fees. Reflected in other income during the third quarters of 2008 and 2007 were reductions of $14 million and $11 million, respectively, resulting from M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group, LLC ("BLG"), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender in which M&T invested on February 5, 2007.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
 
7-7-7-7-7 M&T BANK CORPORATION
Including expenses associated with M&T's investment in BLG, most notably interest expense, that investment reduced M&T's net income by approximately $11 million (after tax effect) in the third quarter of 2008, while a similar reduction amounted to $9 million in the third quarter of 2007. BLG's operating results reflect losses incurred on sales of loans due to significant disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. In response to the illiquidity in the marketplace, BLG has reduced its originations activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its contingent liquidity sources.
     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2008 totaled $435 million, compared with $391 million in the third quarter of 2007. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million in each of the third quarters of 2008 and 2007. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $419 million in the recent quarter, compared with $375 million in the third quarter of 2007. The higher level of operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier period was due largely to increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real estate properties.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 55.2% in the third quarter of 2008, compared with 51.6% in the year-earlier period.
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      M&T had total assets of $65.2 billion at September 30, 2008, up from $60.0 billion at September 30, 2007. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $48.7 billion at September 30, 2008, compared with $44.8 billion a year earlier. Deposits aggregated $42.5 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $38.5 billion at September 30, 2007. Total stockholders' equity was $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion at September 30, 2008 and 2007, representing 9.83% and 10.40%, respectively, of total assets. Common stockholders' equity per share was $58.17 and $58.40 at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Tangible equity per common share was $27.67 at September 30, 2008, compared with $29.48 at September 30, 2007. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
