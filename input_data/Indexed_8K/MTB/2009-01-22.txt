Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for 2008.
      Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") were $.92 in the fourth quarter of 2008, up from $.60 in the year-earlier period and $.82 in 2008's third quarter. On the same basis, net income for the recently completed quarter totaled $102 million, up from $65 million and $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008, respectively. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity, GAAP-basis net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was .63% and 6.41%, respectively, improved from .42% and 4.05%, respectively, in the similar period of 2007, and .56% and 5.66%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2008.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     GAAP-basis diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $5.01 and $5.95, respectively. On the same basis, net income was $556 million in 2008 and $654 million in 2007. GAAP-basis net income for 2008 expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was .85% and 8.64%, respectively, compared with 1.12% and 10.47%, respectively, in 2007.

     Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reflecting on M&T's 2008 performance, noted, "During the past year, M&T once again remained solidly profitable through a very difficult period of time for the U.S. economy. We continue to benefit from a flight to quality by depositors, which resulted in core deposit growth of 11% for the year and an annualized 18% for the fourth quarter, which was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in those deposits. Significantly, we also experienced growth in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans during 2008 of 15%, and an annualized 5% during the fourth quarter. We continued to invest in our infrastructure in the Mid-Atlantic region, by opening three new branches and by announcing our pending acquisition of Provident Bankshares Corporation. As we work through the current economic and credit cycles, we believe that M&T, while not immune to economic factors, is well-positioned to serve the needs of our customers and our shareholders."
      Based on a detailed review of its investment securities portfolio, during the recent quarter other-than-temporary impairment charges of $24 million (pre-tax) were recorded by M&T on certain securities. Each of those securities continues to make payments, as required. Also recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 was a $19 million (pre-tax) addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. That addition resulted from lower mortgage interest rates at the 2008 year-end as compared with September 30, 2008. Those two items reduced M&T's fourth quarter 2008 net income and diluted earnings per common share by $26 million and $.24, respectively.
Notable Fourth Quarter Events.
 
3-3-3-3-3 M&T BANK CORPORATION
     M&T announced in December that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Provident Bankshares Corporation ("Provident")in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident, which is based in Baltimore, Maryland, had approximately $6.4 billion of assets at September 30, 2008. The transaction, which will give M&T the second largest deposit share in Maryland and will triple its presence in Virginia, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2009.
      M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, because such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 totaled $41 million ($.36 per diluted common share) and $40 million ($.37 per diluted common share), respectively. Similar amortization charges, after tax effect, were $10 million in each of the quarters ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2008, or $.08 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $.09 per diluted common share in each of the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008. Merger-related acquisition and integration expenses aggregated $2 million (after tax effect) in 2008, or $.02 of diluted earnings per common share. Similar expenses

totaled $9 million (after tax effect) in the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2007, or $.08 of diluted earnings per common share. There were no such expenses in the final two quarters of 2008.
     Diluted net operating earnings per common share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $5.39 in 2008 and $6.40 in 2007. Net operating income for 2008 and 2007 aggregated $599 million and $704 million, respectively. Net operating income in 2008 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common stockholders' equity was .97% and 19.63%, respectively, compared with 1.27% and 22.58% in 2007.
     For 2008's fourth quarter, diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.00, up from $.77 in the corresponding 2007 period and $.91 in 2008's third quarter. Net operating income for the final quarters of 2008 and 2007 was $112 million and $84 million, respectively, compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2008. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity was .72% and 15.01%, respectively, compared with .57% and 10.49% in the similar period of 2007, and .65% and 13.17%, respectively, in 2008's third quarter.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.96 billion in 2008, 5% higher than $1.87 billion in 2007. The most significant contributor to that improvement was growth in average loans and leases outstanding, which rose 11% to $48.8 billion in 2008 from $44.1 billion in
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
 
5-5-5-5-5 M&T BANK CORPORATION
2007. Such growth was attributable to average outstanding balance increases in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans. Of the $4.7 billion increase in average loans, approximately $1.5 billion resulted from the 2007 acquisitions. Average deposits rose 6% from 2007 to 2008, and also reflected the impact of the $2.4 billion of deposits added from the late-2007 acquisitions. The favorable impact of higher loans on taxable-equivalent net interest income was partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007.
     During the fourth quarter of 2008, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $491 million, up 3% from $476 million in the corresponding 2007 quarter. Average loans outstanding and annualized net interest margin in 2008's final quarter were $48.8 billion and 3.37%, respectively, compared with $46.1 billion and 3.45% in the year-earlier period. The recent quarter's net interest margin was down slightly from 3.39% in the third quarter of 2008 as was taxable-equivalent net interest income which declined less than 1% from $493 million in that quarter.
      The provision for credit losses rose to $412 million in 2008 from $192 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs in 2008 totaled $383 million, or .78% of average loans outstanding, compared with $114 million or .26% of average loans in 2007. The provision for credit losses was $151 million during the recently completed quarter, compared with $101 million in the corresponding 2007 period. Net charge-offs of loans were $144 million in the final quarter of 2008, representing an annualized 1.17% of average loans outstanding, compared with $53 million or .46% during the year-earlier quarter. During 2008's third quarter, the provision for credit losses totaled $101

million and net charge-offs aggregated $94 million, or .77% of average loans outstanding.
     The rise in net charge-offs from 2007 to 2008 was significantly influenced by the state of the economy in the United States, which was in recession throughout 2008, and was adversely affected by steep declines in residential real estate values and the impact of those declines on businesses and investments directly tied to the residential real estate marketplace. The most significant contributors to the higher level of net charge-offs in 2008 were charge-offs of: loans to residential real estate builders and developers of $100 million, up from $4 million in 2007; commercial loans of $94 million, up from $24 million in 2007; residential real estate loans of $65 million as compared with $19 million in 2007; and consumer loans of $112 million, up from $65 million in the prior year.
     Loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $755 million, or 1.54% of total loans at December 31, 2008, compared with $431 million or .90% a year earlier and $688 million or 1.41% at September 30, 2008. Major factors contributing to the year-over-year increase were a $124 million increase in loans to residential builders and developers and a $75 million increase in residential real estate loans. The $67 million increase in nonaccrual loans since September 30, 2008 reflects increases of $29 million in loans to residential builders and developers, $19 million in commercial loans and $15 million in residential real estate loans.
     Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans increased to $100 million at December 31, 2008 from $40 million at December 31, 2007 and $85 million at September 30, 2008, due to residential

real estate loan defaults and additions from residential real estate development projects.
     During 2008, in an effort to assist borrowers M&T modified the terms of residential real estate mortgages having outstanding balances at December 31, 2008 of approximately $162 million. The modified loans were largely from M&T's portfolio of Alt-A loans. Of that total, $93 million were included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2008. After a period of demonstrated performance, those loans may begin to accrue interest in 2009. The remaining $69 million of modified loans were classified as renegotiated loans, were current in their payments and were accruing interest at the 2008 year-end.
     Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $159 million at the recent year-end, up from $77 million at December 31, 2007 and $96 million at September 30, 2008. Included in those past due but accruing amounts were $114 million, $73 million and $90 million at December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2008, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government-related entities.
      M&T regularly performs detailed analyses of individual borrowers and portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Reflecting those analyses, the allowance was $788 million, or 1.61% of total loans, at December 31, 2008, compared with $759 million, or 1.58%, a year earlier and $781 million, or 1.60% at September 30, 2008. The ratio of M&T's allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans was 104% and 176% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and 113% at September 30, 2008.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
 
8-8-8-8-8 M&T BANK CORPORATION
      Noninterest income aggregated $939 million in 2008, compared with $933 million in 2007. Reflected in those amounts were losses from bank investment securities of $148 million and $126 million, respectively, due in large part to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of M&T's collateralized debt obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding the impact of those securities losses, noninterest income was $1.09 billion in 2008, 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. Higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for providing deposit account services were partially offset by a $46 million decline in M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group LLC ("BLG"), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender in which M&T invested on February 5, 2007.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
     Noninterest income of $241 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 was up 50% from $160 million in the corresponding 2007 quarter. Excluding losses from bank investment securities, noninterest income in the recent quarter was $265 million, down 8% from $288 million in the year-earlier quarter. That decline was primarily due to a $23 million lower contribution from M&T's pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG. On the same basis, noninterest income in 2008's third quarter was $266 million, which was comparable to the $265 million earned on the same basis in 2008's fourth quarter.
     Noninterest expense in 2008 totaled $1.73 billion, compared with $1.63 billion in 2007. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be "nonoperating" in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $67 million in 2008 and $66 million in 2007 and merger-related expenses
 
9-9-9-9-9 M&T BANK CORPORATION
of $4 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.66 billion in 2008 and $1.55 billion in 2007. The higher level of operating expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due largely to increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real estate properties. Also contributing to the rise in operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting those factors was a $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Bank's obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in 2008's initial quarter of $15 million.
     Noninterest expense in the final quarter of 2008 totaled $447 million, compared with $445 million in the year-earlier quarter and $435 million in 2008's third quarter. Included in such amounts were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million in each of the quarters ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2008, and merger-related expenses of $15 million in 2007's fourth quarter. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $431 million in the recent quarter, compared with $415 million in 2007's fourth quarter and $419 million in the third quarter of 2008.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 54.4% in 2008,
 
10-10-10-10-10 M&T BANK CORPORATION
compared with 52.8% in 2007. During 2008's fourth quarter, M&T's efficiency ratio was 57.0%, compared with 54.3% in the year-earlier quarter and 55.2% in the third quarter of 2008.
      M&T had total assets of $65.8 billion at December 31, 2008, up from $64.9 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, totaled $49.0 billion at the 2008 year-end, up 2% from $48.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Deposits were $42.6 billion at December 31, 2008, 3% higher than $41.3 billion at the end of 2007. Total stockholders' equity was $6.8 billion at December 31, 2008, representing 10.31% of total assets, compared with $6.5 billion or 10.00% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity was $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share at December 31, 2008, compared with $6.5 billion, or $58.99 per share, a year earlier. Tangible equity per common share was $25.94 and $27.98 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, common stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.4 billion at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007.
Balance Sheet.
     During December 2008, M&T chose to participate in the U.S. Treasury's ("Treasury") Capital Purchase Program and, as a result, issued $600 million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase M&T's common stock to the U.S. Government. M&T elected to participate at the minimum of the range outlined by the Treasury.
