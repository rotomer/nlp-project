Exhibit 99
     BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T") (NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
      Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the first quarter of 2009 were $.49. GAAP-basis net income in the recently completed quarter totaled $64 million. GAAP-basis net income for the initial quarter of 2009 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was .40% and 3.61%, respectively.
GAAP Results of Operations.
     M&T recognized $32 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment charges in the recent quarter on certain available-for-sale investment securities. Those charges reduced net income and diluted earnings per common share by $20 million and $.18, respectively, and reflect M&T's early adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements. However, because the investment securities were previously reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, the impairment charges did not reduce stockholders' equity. Also reflected in the recent quarter's results was a provision for credit losses of $158 million, which exceeded net loan charge-offs by $58 million.

     Commenting on M&T's first quarter results, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, noted, "Our performance for the quarter was dampened by the impairment charges on investment securities and a higher provision for credit losses. We also experienced a temporary decline in our net interest margin. Most important, despite those factors, we continued to remain profitable, and we generated sufficient capital to improve our tangible capital ratio from the end of 2008, without reducing our common stock dividend. We have also seen several positive signs in the quarter. Net charge-offs of 83 basis points of total loans were improved from last quarter and will likely stand out favorably when compared to the top U.S. regional banks. Despite that improvement, we considered it prudent to build the allowance for credit losses given the state of the economy. Core customer deposits grew by $1.7 billion, or an annualized 20 percent, on the heels of $1.5 billion or 18 percent growth experienced last quarter. Impressively, noninterest-bearing deposits jumped an annualized 28% from the fourth quarter. Finally, our residential mortgage banking operations registered record revenues during the quarter."
     Diluted earnings per common share were $1.82 and $.92 in the first and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively. Net income for those respective quarters was $202 million and $102 million. Net income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity for the first quarter of 2008 was 1.25% and 12.49%, respectively, compared with .63% and 6.41%, respectively, in 2008's final quarter. Net income for the first three months of 2008 included $29 million, or $.26 of diluted earnings per common share, as a result of M&T Bank's membership interest in Visa. Net income for the fourth quarter 2008 reflected other-than-temporary impairment charges on

certain investment securities that reduced net income and diluted earnings per common share by $14 million and $.13, respectively.
      M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $9 million ($.09 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $11 million ($.10 per diluted common share) in the year-earlier quarter and $10 million ($.08 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2008. Expenses associated with M&T's pending acquisition of Provident Bankshares Corporation ("Provident") were $1 million, after tax effect, or $.01 of diluted earnings per common share, during the recent quarter. Merger-related acquisition and integration expenses during the three-month period ended March 31, 2008 related to prior acquisitions totaled $2 million, after tax effect, or $.02 of diluted earnings per common share. There were no such charges in 2008's fourth quarter.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
     Diluted net operating earnings per common share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $.59 for the first quarter of 2009, compared with $1.94 in the year-earlier

quarter. Net operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $75 million, compared with $216 million in the corresponding 2008 quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common stockholders' equity, net operating income was ..50% and 9.36%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2009, compared with 1.41% and 27.86% in the initial quarter of 2008. Diluted net operating earnings per common share and net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $1.00 and $112 million, respectively. The annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common stockholders' equity were .72% and 15.01%, respectively, in the final quarter of 2008.
      Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $453 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $485 million in the year-earlier quarter and $491 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The lower net interest income in the recent quarter as compared with the final 2008 quarter reflects a narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 3.19% from 3.37%. The narrowing was largely attributable to a rapid decline in market interest rates late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the impact on rates earned on loans repricing more quickly than the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
      The provision for credit losses was $158 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $60 million and $151 million in the year-earlier quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2008, respectively. Net charge-offs of loans during the recent quarter were $100 million, improved from $144 million in the final quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs were $46 million in the initial 2008 quarter.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
 
5-5-5-5-5 M&T BANK CORPORATION
Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .83% and ..38% in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and 1.17% in 2008's fourth quarter. The excess of the provision over net charge-offs in the recent quarter was deemed necessary due largely to a commercial loan that was transferred to nonaccrual status during the quarter and for which the full collectibility is in doubt.
     The higher levels of net charge-offs in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of 2008 were largely driven by the continuing recession being experienced in the United States. Sharp declines have been experienced in residential real estate values, which has adversely impacted businesses and investments tied directly to the residential real estate marketplace.
     Loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $1.0 billion, or 2.05% of total loans at March 31, 2009, up from $755 million or 1.54% at December 31, 2008 and $477 million or .97% at March 31, 2008. Major factors contributing to the rise in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2008 to the recent quarter-end were a $62 million increase in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate and a $41 million increase in residential real estate loans, as well as the commercial loan already noted that was added to this category. Those same factors were large contributors to the rise in nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2009 as compared with a year earlier.
     Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $100 million at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, up from $53 million at March 31, 2008. The higher levels of such assets at the two most recent quarter-ends were due to residential real

estate loan defaults and additions from residential real estate development projects.
     In an effort to assist borrowers, M&T continues to modify the terms of select residential real estate loans, consisting largely of loans in M&T's portfolio of Alt-A loans. At March 31, 2009, modified loans totaled $216 million, of which $106 million were classified as nonaccrual. The remaining modified loans were classified as renegotiated loans at March 31, 2009 and were accruing interest at that date.
     Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest were $143 million at the end of the recently completed quarter, compared with $81 million at March 31, 2008 and $159 million at December 31, 2008. Included in those past due but accruing amounts were loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $127 million and $77 million at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $114 million at December 31, 2008.
      M&T regularly performs detailed analyses of individual borrowers and portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Reflecting those analyses, the allowance totaled $846 million, or 1.73% of total loans, at March 31, 2009, compared with $774 million, or 1.57%, a year earlier and $788 million, or 1.61%, at December 31, 2008.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
      Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income totaled $264 million and $279 million in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $265 million in 2008's final quarter. Contributing to the lower noninterest income in the initial 2009 quarter as compared with the similar 2008 quarter were declines

in credit-related fees, trust income, and trading account and foreign exchange gains. Partially offsetting those declines were significantly higher residential mortgage banking revenues, which rose 50% to $48 million in the recent quarter from $32 million in the year-earlier period, and were up 64% from $29 million in 2008's final quarter. Residential mortgage loans in the pipeline, which include loans originated for sale and commitments to originate loans for sale, surged to $4.4 billion at March 31, 2009, up 53% from a year earlier and 85% higher than at December 31, 2008. As compared with 2008's fourth quarter, the recent quarter's record level of residential mortgage banking revenues were offset by seasonally lower fees for providing consumer deposit account services and lower bank owned life insurance income and other market-sensitive revenues.
     Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2009 aggregated $438 million, compared with $426 million and $447 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $421 million in the recently completed quarter, $404 million in the first quarter of 2008 and $431 million in the final 2008 quarter. Reflected in such expenses in the recent quarter was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $5 million, compared with additions to the valuation allowance of $5 million and $19 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively, and a $15 million reversal of a Visa litigation accrual in 2008's initial quarter. Contributing to the remaining 3% increase in operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier

quarter were higher charges for professional services and deposit insurance. The rise in expenses from the fourth quarter of 2008 was largely the result of seasonally higher costs for stock-based compensation, payroll-related taxes and the Company's contributions for retirement savings plan benefits related to incentive compensation payments.
     The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter of 2009, compared with 52.8% in the year-earlier period and 57.0% in the fourth quarter of 2008.
      M&T had total assets of $64.9 billion at March 31, 2009, compared with $66.1 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $48.9 billion at the recent quarter-end, compared with $49.3 billion at March 31, 2008. Total deposits rose 2% to $42.5 billion at March 31, 2009 from $41.5 billion a year earlier. Domestic deposits jumped $4.5 billion, or 13%, to $40.3 billion at the most recent quarter-end from $35.8 billion at March 31, 2008. Total stockholders' equity was $6.9 billion and $6.5 billion at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing 10.64% of total assets at the recent quarter-end and 9.82% a year earlier. Common stockholders' equity was $6.3 billion, or $56.95 per share at March 31, 2009, compared with $6.5 billion, or $58.92 per share, a year earlier. Tangible equity per common share was $26.90 at March 31, 2009, compared with $28.14 a year earlier. The year-over-year declines in the per share amounts for common stockholders' equity and tangible common equity were largely the result of higher net unrealized losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. In the

calculation of tangible equity per common share, common stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
     M&T announced in December 2008 that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Provident in a stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2009, pending regulatory approvals. Provident's shareholders approved the transaction earlier this month.
