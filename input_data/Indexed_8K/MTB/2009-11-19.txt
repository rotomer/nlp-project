Item 5.03.  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     (a) The Board of Directors of M&T Bank Corporation adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective as of November 16, 2009. The Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "bylaws") were adopted in order to implement a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections. An amendment to Article I, Section 9 of the bylaws was adopted to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of the votes cast in favor or against the election of a nominee. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast by the holders of M&T Bank Corporation stock entitled to vote.
          In an uncontested election, if a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected, such director will tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The independent members of the Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation and publicly disclose and explain their decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. In making their decision, the independent members of the Board of Directors may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant, including the recommendation of the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee or the decision of the independent members of the Board of Directors. If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board of Directors, that vacancy may be filled by the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 6 of the bylaws or the Board of Directors may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 1 of the bylaws.
Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

EXHIBIT 3.5
 
     The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may be set forth in the notice of the meeting, shall be held each year at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place within or without the State of New York as the Board of Directors shall determine and the notice of the meeting shall specify the hour of day on the third Tuesday in April in each year or at such other date within the period of 60 days next succeeding such date as the Board of Directors shall determine. If that day be a legal holiday in any year, the meeting shall be held on the next following that is not a legal holiday.
Section 1
.
Annual Meeting
:
     Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the Board of Directors or by the Chief Executive Officer, and shall be called by the Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Secretary at the request in writing of the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is to be called. Each special meeting of the stockholders shall be held at such time as the Board of Directors or the person calling the meeting (the Chief Executive Officer, Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary, as the case may be) shall determine and the notice of the meeting shall specify, and shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place within or without the State of New York as the Board of Directors shall determine or the notice of meeting shall specify.

Special Meetings
:
     Written notice of each meeting of the stockholders shall be given, personally or by mail, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deposited in the United States mail, with first-class postage thereon prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the record of stockholders, or, if he or she shall have filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him or her be mailed to some other address, then directed to him or her at such other address. The notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and, unless it is the annual meeting, indicate that the notice is being issued by or at the direction of the person calling the meeting. The notice need not refer to the approval of minutes or to other matters normally incident to the conduct of the meeting. Except for such matters, the business which may be transacted at the meeting shall be confined to business which is related to the purpose or purposes set forth in the notice. If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if taken, entitle dissenting stockholders to receive payment for their shares, the notice of such meeting shall include a statement of that purpose and to that effect.

     Whenever under any provision of these Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, the terms of any agreement or instrument, or law, the Corporation or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof is authorized to take any action after notice to any person or persons or after the lapse of a prescribed period of time, such action may be taken without notice and without the lapse of such period of time, if at any time before or after such action is completed the person or persons entitled to such notice or entitled to participate in the action to be taken or, in the case of a stockholder, by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact, submit a signed waiver of notice of such requirements. The attendance of any stockholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy, without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her.
Section 4

Section 5

     A list of stockholders as of the record date, certified by the corporate officer responsible for its preparation or by a transfer agent, shall be produced at any meeting of stockholders upon the request thereat or prior thereto of any stockholder. If the right to vote at any meeting is challenged, the inspectors of election, or person presiding thereat, shall require such list of stockholders to be produced as evidence of the right of the persons challenged to vote at such meeting, and all persons who appear from such list to be stockholders entitled to vote thereat may vote at such meeting.
Section 6
.
List of Stockholders
:
     At each meeting of stockholders for the transaction of any business, a quorum shall be present to organize such meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, a quorum shall consist of the holders of record of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, present either in person or by proxy. When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting of the stockholders, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders.
Section 7

At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting and the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting on the original date (whether or not they were present thereat), and no others, shall be entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting.

Voting; Proxies; Majority Vote Standard for Uncontested Director Elections
:
     (a) Each stockholder of record shall be entitled at every meeting of stockholders to one vote for each share having voting power standing in his or her name on the record of stockholders of the Corporation on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 3 of Article VI of these Bylaws.
 
     (b) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person, or may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy. Any proxy may be signed by such stockholder or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact, including by facsimile signature, and shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting, or may be authorized by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission provided that it can be reasonably determined from such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission that such proxy was authorized by the stockholder. The signature of a stockholder on any proxy, including without limitation a telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission, may be printed, stamped or written, or provided by other reliable reproduction, provided such signature is executed or adopted by the stockholder with intention to authenticate the proxy. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except as otherwise provided by law.
     (c) All corporate action to be taken by vote of the stockholders other than the election of directors shall, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these Bylaws, be authorized by a majority of the votes cast in favor or against such action. At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the vote required for election of a director by the stockholders shall, except in a contested election, be the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in favor of or against the election of a nominee. In a contested election, the persons receiving a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of stock entitled to vote thereat shall be the directors. An election shall be deemed to be contested if, as of the record date for such meeting, there are more nominees for election than positions on the Board of Directors to be filled by election at the meeting. The vote for directors, or upon any question before a meeting of stockholders, shall not be by ballot unless the person presiding at such meeting shall so direct or any stockholder, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, shall so demand.
     (d) In the event of an uncontested election of directors, any incumbent director who is a nominee for election as a director and who is not elected by the stockholders shall immediately tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, subject to acceptance or rejection by the Board of Directors as provided in this Section 9(d). The independent members of the Board of Directors, in accordance with the procedures established by the Board of Directors, shall decide whether or not to accept such resignation within 90 days after the date the results of the election are certified and the Corporation shall promptly disclose and explain such decision in a document furnished or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The independent members of the Board of Directors in making their decision, may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant, including the recommendation of the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such director's resignation is rejected by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Article I, Section 9, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to
 
the provisions of Article II, Section 6 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 1.
     The Board of Directors shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, and may appoint one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to appear or act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed, or in case any inspector or alternate inspector appointed fails to appear or act, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment made by the person presiding thereat. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. No person who is a candidate for the office of director of the Corporation shall act as an inspector at any meeting of the stockholders at which directors are elected.
Section 10
.
Appointment of Inspectors of Election
:
     Whenever one or more inspectors of election may be appointed as provided in these Bylaws, he, she or they shall determine the number of shares outstanding and entitled to vote, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots, or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.

     For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to clause (c) above, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof to the Corporate Secretary and such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the following dates: (1) at the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders if the date of the annual meeting is not changed more than 30 days from the date of the preceding year's annual meeting, and (2) with respect to any other annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders, the close of business on the tenth day following the date of public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the names and business addresses of the stockholder and all Persons (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through the date of adoption of these Bylaws) acting in concert with the stockholder; (ii) the names and addresses of the stockholder and the Persons identified in clause (i), as they appear on the

The person presiding at the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this section and, if he or she shall so determine, he or she shall declare to the meeting that any business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
     The number of directors constituting the entire Board shall not be less than three, except that where all the shares of the Corporation are owned beneficially and of record by less than three stockholders, the number of directors may be less than three, but not less than the number of stockholders. Subject to any provision as to the number of directors contained in the certificate of incorporation or these Bylaws, the exact number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by action of the stockholders or by vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors, provided that no decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director; and provided, further, that, until the Sunset Date (as defined in Article XII hereof), without the consent of the Significant Stockholder (as defined in Article XII hereof), the number of directors shall not exceed 28. If the number of directors be increased at any time, the vacancy or vacancies in the Board arising from such increase shall be filled as provided in Section 6 of this Article II. All of the directors shall be at least twenty-one years of age.

Nomination and Recommendation of Significant Stockholder Designees
:
     (a) For so long as the Significant Stockholder holds at least fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors, acting through the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, shall nominate and recommend for election as directors of the Corporation at least four (4) persons designated by the Significant Stockholder, each of whom is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.
     (b) For so long as the Significant Stockholder holds at least ten percent
 
(10%), but less than fifteen percent (15%), of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors, acting through the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, shall nominate and recommend for election as directors of the Corporation at least two (2) persons designated by the Significant Stockholder, each of whom is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.
     (c) For so long as the Significant Stockholder holds at least five percent (5%), but less than ten percent (10%), of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors, acting through the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee, shall nominate and recommend for election as a director of the Corporation at least one (1) person designated by the Significant Stockholder, who is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.
     (d) For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of common stock of this Corporation for purposes of this Article II, Section 3, Article X, Section 3 and Article XII, Section 1(h), there shall be used the number of shares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as outstanding on the cover page of the Corporation's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K or Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, or the number of shares of common stock of the Corporation actually outstanding as of a later date, if requested by the Corporation or the Significant Stockholder, determined on the same basis as the number of shares disclosed on such Reports. Any share held by any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Significant Stockholder of which the Significant Stockholder holds 80% or more of the outstanding equity capital or voting shares shall be deemed held by the Significant Stockholder. In the event that the transaction that would result in the Significant Stockholder's holdings being below any threshold set forth herein is a transaction that gives rise to an Issuance Event (as defined in Article XII hereof), no diminution in the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation held by the Significant Stockholder shall be deemed to have occurred until the earlier of such time as the Significant Stockholder gives written notice that it shall not exercise its Maintenance Rights (as defined in Article XII hereof) or the deadline for exercise of such Maintenance Rights has passed without the Significant Stockholder having provided notice that it shall exercise the same. No diminution in the percentage of outstanding shares of common stock held by the Significant Stockholder shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of any issuance of shares that is subject to the Corporation's repurchase obligations under Section 7.2(c) or Section 7.2(e) of the Reorganization Agreement. In the event that the Significant Stockholder's holdings decrease to less than fifteen percent (15%), but not less than twelve percent (12%), of the outstanding common stock, the Significant Stockholder's holdings shall be deemed to be equal to fifteen percent (15%) for all purposes of the definition of Sunset Date and of this Article II, Section 3, unless, not later than one year from the date on which the Significant Stockholder's holdings decreased to less than fifteen percent (15%), the Significant Stockholder's holdings have not been restored to at least fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation.
     (e) In the event that the Corporation objects to any designee for Board or committee service on the grounds that such designee is not "reasonably acceptable" under any provision of this Article II, Section 3, the Corporation shall fully cooperate and shall use best efforts to work with the Significant Stockholder to promptly resolve any such objection so that such designee may as promptly as practicable serve in the capacity for which he or she has been
 
designated or, in the alternative, to promptly identify a substitute candidate that is reasonably acceptable, in order to give effect to the intention of the Corporation and the Significant Stockholder regarding Board and committee representation, as applicable, contemplated by this Article II, Section 3.
     Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving his or her resignation to the President or any Vice President or the Corporate Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

     Any director may be removed for cause, at any meeting of stockholders notice of which shall have referred to the proposed action, by vote of the stockholders.
