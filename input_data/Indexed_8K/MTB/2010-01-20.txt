Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 20, 2010, M&T Bank Corporation announced its results of operations for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2009. The public announcement was made by means of a news release, the text of which is set forth in Exhibit 99 hereto.
The information in this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99 attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing of M&T Bank Corporation under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99
BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T")(NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for 2009.
Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") increased to $1.04 in the fourth quarter of 2009, up 13% from 2008's fourth quarter. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter totaled $137 million. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity, GAAP-basis net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was .79% and 7.09%, respectively.
GAAP Results of Operations.
During the recent quarter, M&T recognized $21 million of after-tax other-than-temporary impairment charges on certain available-for-sale investment securities. However, because those investment securities were previously reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, the impairment charges did not reduce shareholders' equity. M&T also incurred merger-related expenses of $4 million, after applicable tax effect, associated with its second quarter acquisition of Provident Bankshares Corporation ("Provident") and with its third quarter agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to assume all of the deposits and acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank ("Bradford"). Aggregating $25 million, those two charges reduced diluted earnings per common share in the final

quarter of 2009 by $.21. GAAP-basis diluted earnings per common share and net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2.89 and $380 million, respectively. Reflected in 2009's results were $36 million of net merger-related expenses, after tax effect, or $.31 of diluted earnings per common share. GAAP-basis net income for 2009 expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity was .56% and 5.07%, respectively.
Reflecting on M&T's financial performance, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "By sticking with our approach of providing lending and banking services in our local markets, M&T produced solid earnings for both the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2009. We were pleased to see a continued widening of our net interest margin, which improved 10 basis points to 3.71% in the quarter. That key measure has increased for three consecutive quarters. Credit costs in the fourth quarter were down slightly and continue to be below current industry experience. The tangible common equity ratio strengthened impressively during the recent quarter, and was 5.13% at the end of 2009, up from 4.89% at September 30, 2009. Finally, our 2009 acquisitions of Provident and Bradford in the Mid-Atlantic region have proved to be meaningful, both in terms of the customer base to which we now provide our banking services and in our profitability, as they supplemented M&T's full-year diluted net operating earnings per common share by $.16."
Diluted earnings per common share were $.92 and $.97 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009, respectively. Net income for those respective quarters was $102 million and $128 million. Net income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common

stockholders' equity for the fourth quarter of 2008 was .63% and 6.41%, respectively, compared with ..73% and 6.72%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, diluted earnings per common share and net income were $5.01 and $556 million, respectively. Expressed as a rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders' equity, net income was .85% and 8.64%, respectively, in 2008.
M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such expenses are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are provided herein on pages 19 and 20.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.16, up 16% from $1.00 in the similar 2008 period and 18% above $.98 in 2009's third quarter. Net operating income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 was $151 million and $112 million, respectively, compared with $129 million in the third quarter of 2009. For the three months ended December 31, 2009, net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity was .92% and 16.73%, respectively, up

M&T BANK CORPORATION
from .72% and 15.01% in the corresponding period of 2008 and .78% and 14.87%, respectively, in 2009's third quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.54 in 2009 and $5.39 in 2008. Net operating income for 2009 and 2008 aggregated $455 million and $599 million, respectively. Net operating income in 2009 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common stockholders' equity was .71% and 13.42%, respectively, compared with .97% and 19.63% in 2008.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $565 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, up 15% from $491 million in the similar 2008 quarter and 2% higher than $553 million in the third quarter of 2009. The growth in such income as compared with the third quarter of 2009 reflects a widening of the net interest margin, which improved to 3.71% from 3.61%. That improvement resulted from lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings and continued growth in noninterest-bearing deposits.
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $2.08 billion in 2009, 6% higher than $1.96 billion in 2008. Contributing to that improvement was growth in average loans and leases outstanding, which rose 4% to $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008, and a widening of the net interest margin, which rose to 3.49% from 3.38%. The increase in average loans and leases was attributable to the 2009 acquisition transactions and the improved net interest margin resulted from lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.

The provision for credit losses was $145 million during the recently completed quarter, compared with $151 million in the corresponding 2008 period. Net charge-offs of loans were $135 million in the final quarter of 2009, representing an annualized 1.03% of average loans outstanding, improved from $144 million or 1.17% in the year-earlier quarter. During 2009's third quarter, the provision for credit losses totaled $154 million and net charge-offs aggregated $141 million, or 1.07% of average loans outstanding. The provision for credit losses rose to $604 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $412 million in 2008. Net loan charge-offs in 2009 totaled $514 million, or 1.01% of average loans outstanding, compared with $383 million or .78% of average loans in 2008.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
Reflecting the poor economic environment and its impact on businesses and consumers, loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $1.33 billion, or 2.56% of total loans at December 31, 2009, compared with $755 million or 1.54% a year earlier and $1.23 billion or 2.35% at September 30, 2009. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $95 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $100 million at December 31, 2008 and $85 million at September 30, 2009.
In an effort to assist borrowers, M&T has modified the terms of select residential real estate loans, consisting largely of loans in M&T's portfolio of Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2009, outstanding balances of those modified loans totaled $292 million, of which $108 million were classified as nonaccrual. The remaining modified loans have demonstrated payment capability consistent with the modified terms and, accordingly, were classified as renegotiated loans and were accruing interest at the 2009 year-end.

M&T BANK CORPORATION
Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $208 million at the recent year-end, including loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $193 million. Such past due loans were $159 million and $183 million at December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively, including $114 million and $173 million of government guaranteed loans at those respective dates.
M&T regularly performs detailed analyses of individual borrowers and portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Reflecting those analyses, the allowance for credit losses was $878 million at December 31, 2009, increased from $788 million a year earlier and $868 million at September 30, 2009. Beginning in 2009, GAAP requires that expected credit losses associated with loans obtained in an acquisition be reflected in the estimation of loan fair value as of each respective acquisition date and prohibits any carryover of an allowance for credit losses. Excluding loans obtained in the Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions, the allowance-to-legacy loan ratio increased to 1.83% at December 31, 2009 from 1.61% at December 31, 2008. That same ratio was 1.81% at September 30, 2009.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income of $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 was up 13% from $265 million in the similar 2008 quarter. Also excluding gains and losses from investment securities and the $29 million gain recorded on the Bradford transaction, noninterest income in 2009's third quarter was $296 million. On the same basis, noninterest income was $1.16 billion in 2009, 6% higher than $1.09 billion in 2008. Contributing to the improvements in the 2009 periods as compared
Noninterest Income and Expense.

with 2008 were higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on acquisition-related deposit accounts.
Noninterest expense in the final quarter of 2009 totaled $478 million, compared with $447 million in the year-earlier quarter and $500 million in 2009's third quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses. Exclusive of these expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $455 million in the recent quarter, compared with $431 million in 2008's fourth quarter and $469 million in the third quarter of 2009. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $1.98 billion, compared with $1.73 billion in 2008. Excluding those expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature, noninterest operating expenses were $1.83 billion in 2009 and $1.66 billion in 2008. The higher levels of operating expenses in the 2009 periods as compared with 2008 were due largely to the operations obtained in the 2009 acquisitions and higher deposit insurance assessments, including a $33 million special assessment levied by the FDIC in the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting those factors were reversals of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $4 million in the fourth quarter and $22 million for the full year of 2009, as compared with additions to that allowance of $19 million and $16 million in those respective periods of 2008. Contributing to the decline in noninterest operating expenses from the third to the fourth quarter of 2009 were lower costs for salaries, including incentive compensation.

The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities and gains on merger transactions), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio improved to 52.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 57.0% in the year-earlier quarter and 55.2% in the third quarter of 2009. M&T's efficiency ratio for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 56.5% and 54.4%, respectively. If the second quarter 2009 special assessment by the FDIC was excluded from the computation, the efficiency ratio for 2009 would have been 55.5%.
M&T had total assets of $68.9 billion at December 31, 2009, up from $65.8 billion a year earlier. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, totaled $51.9 billion at the 2009 year-end, up 6% from $49.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Total deposits were $47.4 billion at December 31, 2009, 11% higher than $42.6 billion at the end of 2008. Deposits at domestic offices rose $7.9 billion, or 20%, to $46.4 billion at the recent year-end from $38.5 billion at December 31, 2008. When excluding the impact of the 2009 acquisition transactions, core customer deposits jumped 16% to $39.9 billion at December 31, 2009 from $34.3 billion a year earlier. That substantial rise was largely driven by a $4.0 billion or 45% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.
Balance Sheet.
Total stockholders' equity was $7.8 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, representing 11.26% and 10.31% respectively, of total assets. Common stockholders' equity was $7.0 billion, or $59.31 per share at December 31, 2009, up from $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share, a year earlier. Tangible equity per common share was $28.27 and $25.94 at December 31,

2009 and 2008, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances, which aggregated $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. M&T's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 5.13% at December 31, 2009, compared with 4.59% and 4.89% at December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively.
