Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
The 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of M&T Bank Corporation was held on April 20, 2010. At the 2010 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved all of management's proposals which included (i) the election of seventeen (17) directors, all of whom were then serving as directors of M&T Bank Corporation, for terms of one (1) year and until their successors are elected and qualified; (ii) the approval of the compensation of M&T Bank Corporation's Named Executive Officers; and (iii) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of M&T Bank Corporation for the year ending December 31, 2010. Abstentions and broker non-votes were counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum was present, but were not treated as votes cast on a proposal. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes did not have the effect of a vote for or against such proposal and were not counted in determining the number of votes required for approval.
The following table reflects the tabulation of the votes with respect to each director who was elected at the 2010 Annual Meeting:
