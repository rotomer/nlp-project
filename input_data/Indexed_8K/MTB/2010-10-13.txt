     (viii) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement will not contravene (i) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or,
 
(ii) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any U.S. federal or State of New York governmental body or agency is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement.
     (c) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, special counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

provided
however
     (v) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement will not violate the Other Covered Laws;
     (vi) the statements in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Capital Stock" and "Plan of Distribution", insofar as they relate to provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or this Agreement, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects;
     (vii) the statements included in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income and Estate Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders", insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S.

     (viii) the Company is not, and after the occurrence of the transactions described in the Securities Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the 1940 Act.

"Other Covered Laws" for purposes of the foregoing opinion means the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York (including the published rules or regulations thereunder) that in such counsel's experience normally are applicable to general business corporations and transactions such as those contemplated by this Agreement; , that such term does not include Federal or state securities laws, other antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, antitrust laws or any law that is applicable to the Company, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby solely as part of a regulatory regime applicable to the Company or its affiliates due to its or their status, business or assets.
provided
however,
     In addition, such counsel shall state that it has reviewed the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants, and that on the basis of the information that such counsel gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of its understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience such counsel has gained through its practice under the Securities Act, (1) in the opinion of such counsel, the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Shares, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and (2) nothing that came to the attention of such counsel in the course of such review has caused such counsel to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Shares,
     (a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
 
     (b) the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as amended or supplemented, if applicable, as of the Closing Date, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     Such counsel may also state that the limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that they do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, except to the extent specifically noted in clauses (vi) and (vii) above, and that they do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, as to management's report of its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' report as to the Company's internal control over financial reporting, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement.
     (d) The Underwriters shall have received, on each of the date hereof and the Closing Date, a letter dated the date hereof or the Closing Date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off date" not earlier than the date hereof.
provided
     4. . The Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows:

. Expenses
     6. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate, director, officer, employee and agent of each Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission
Indemnity
 
based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Managers expressly for use therein. The Company agrees and confirms that references to "affiliates" of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated that appear in this Agreement shall be understood to include Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any road show, any free writing prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto are the statements set forth in the second paragraph under the caption "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (2) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates, and directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters. In the case of any such separate firm for the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     7. . (a) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Securities Prospectus Supplement. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the
Contribution
 
Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased under the AIB Securities Underwriting Agreement, and not joint.
     (b) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 6 and this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     8. . The indemnity provisions contained in Section 6, the contribution provisions contained in Section 7, and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (1) any termination of this Agreement, (2) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of, the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (3) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
Survival
     9. . This Agreement shall terminate if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, the AIB Securities Underwriting Agreement shall have terminated in accordance with the termination provisions contained therein prior to the Closing Date.
Termination
     10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the effectiveness of the AIB Securities Underwriting Agreement.
Effectiveness
 
     11. . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities and the mandatory exchange into Shares.
Entire Agreement
     (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby: (1) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (2) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (3) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
     12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
     13. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
