Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
The 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of M&T Bank Corporation was held on April 17, 2012. At the 2012 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved all of management's proposals which included (i) the election of fourteen (14) directors, all of whom were then serving as directors of M&T Bank Corporation, for terms of one (1) year and until their successors are elected and qualified; (ii) the approval of the compensation of M&T Bank Corporation's Named Executive Officers; and (iii) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of M&T Bank Corporation for the year ending December 31, 2012. The voting results for each proposal, including the votes for and against or withheld, and any abstentions or broker non-votes, are described below. Abstentions and broker non-votes (if applicable) were counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum was present, but were not treated as votes cast. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes (if applicable) did not have the effect of a vote for or against such proposal and were not counted in determining the number of votes required for approval.
