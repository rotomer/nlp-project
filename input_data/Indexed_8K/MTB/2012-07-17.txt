Exhibit 99
 
BUFFALO, NEW YORK  M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T") (NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.
Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the second quarter of 2012 were $1.71, up 14% from $1.50 in the initial 2012 quarter. GAAP-basis net income in the recent quarter totaled $233 million, 13% higher than $206 million in the first quarter of 2012. GAAP-basis net income for the second quarter of 2012 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common shareholders' equity was 1.17% and 10.12%, respectively, improved from 1.06% and 9.04%, respectively, in the immediately preceding quarter.
GAAP Results of Operations.
The recent quarter's results as compared with the first quarter of 2012 reflect a 24% rise in mortgage banking revenues and solid increases in net interest income and trust income, as well as reduced costs for salaries and benefits. The higher mortgage banking revenues reflect significant improvements in both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.
Reflecting on the recent quarter's performance, Ren F. Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "M&T continues to perform well for both our customers and our shareholders. During the second quarter we saw significant

growth in our revenues in the areas of net interest income, mortgage banking and trust services. Our credit experience, specifically net charge-offs as a percentage of loans, continued to favorably outpace the rest of the banking industry and the level of our nonaccrual loans declined $97 million or 9% from March 31. Furthermore, our operating expenses were once again well controlled as reflected in our efficiency ratio, which improved to 56.9% from 61.1%. We view this as a very solid quarter of performance."
Diluted earnings per common share and GAAP-basis net income in the second quarter of 2011 were $2.42 and $322 million, respectively. The recent quarter's results as compared with the second quarter of 2011 reflect increased net interest income, trust income and mortgage banking revenues. Earnings for last year's second quarter were supplemented by realized gains from the sale of investment securities, which totaled $67 million after-tax effect, or $.54 of diluted earnings per common share, as M&T repositioned its balance sheet in conjunction with the May 16, 2011 acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation ("Wilmington Trust"). Also adding to earnings in the second quarter of 2011 was a net after-tax gain of $42 million, or $.33 of diluted earnings per common share, related to the Wilmington Trust acquisition. GAAP-basis net income in that quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common shareholders' equity was 1.78% and 14.94%, respectively.
M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a "net operating" or "tangible" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable

deferred tax amounts) and gains and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T, since such items are considered by management to be "nonoperating" in nature. Although "net operating income" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are provided in the financial tables included herein.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share, which exclude the impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related gains and expenses, but include the effect of securities gains and losses, were $1.82 in the recent quarter, compared with $2.16 and $1.59 in the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively. Net operating income during the second quarter of 2012 was $247 million, compared with $289 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $218 million in the initial 2012 quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity, net operating income in the recently completed quarter was 1.30% and 18.54%, respectively, compared with 1.69% and 24.24% in the year-earlier quarter and 1.18% and 16.79% in the first quarter of 2012.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $655 million in the second quarter of 2012, up an annualized 18% from $627 million in the first quarter of 2012. That improvement was predominantly due to a $2.1 billion increase in average earning assets, including a $1.3 billion increase in average loans outstanding, and a 5 basis point (hundredths of one percent) widening of the net interest margin. The higher net interest margin reflects an additional $14 million of interest income which resulted from an improvement in estimated
Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income.

cash flows expected to be collected on acquired loans. Stabilizing economic conditions and better than expected repayments resulted in an approximate 1% increase in projected cash flows, which will be recognized as interest income over the remaining terms of the acquired loans. Taxable-equivalent net interest income in the recent quarter was up 10% from $593 million in the second quarter of 2011. That improvement resulted from a $7.1 billion increase in average earning assets.
The provision for credit losses was $60 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $63 million in the year-earlier quarter and $49 million in the first quarter of 2012. Net charge-offs of loans were $52 million during the recent quarter, compared with $59 million and $48 million in the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .34% and .43% in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively, and .32% in the first quarter of 2012.
Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality.
Loans classified as nonaccrual declined to $968 million, or 1.54% of total loans outstanding at June 30, 2012, improved from $1.12 billion or 1.91% a year earlier and $1.07 billion or 1.75% at March 31, 2012.
Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $116 million at June 30, 2012, improved from $159 million at June 30, 2011 and $140 million at March 31, 2012.
M&T regularly performs detailed analyses of individual borrowers and portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.

Reflecting those analyses, the allowance totaled $917 million at June 30, 2012, compared with $908 million and $909 million at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2012, respectively. The allowance expressed as a percentage of outstanding loans was 1.46% at June 30, 2012, compared with 1.55% at June 30, 2011 and 1.49% at March 31, 2012.
Noninterest income totaled $392 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $502 million and $377 million in the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively. Reflected in those amounts were net pre-tax losses on investment securities of $17 million and $11 million in the recent quarter and the first quarter of 2012, respectively, and net pre-tax gains from investment securities of $84 million in the second quarter of 2011. The net securities losses in the recent quarter and the initial 2012 quarter were predominantly due to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of M&T's holdings of privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations. The net securities gains in the second quarter of 2011 resulted from $111 million of gains realized on the sale of investment securities available for sale, predominantly residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, collateralized debt obligations and capital preferred securities, having an amortized cost of approximately $1.21 billion. Partially offsetting those securities gains were $27 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of M&T's holdings of privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations. In connection with the Wilmington Trust acquisition, M&T sold investment securities in last year's second quarter in order to manage its balance sheet size and composition and the resultant capital ratios.
Noninterest Income and Expense.
6-6-6-6-6
M&T BANK CORPORATION
Excluding gains and losses from investment securities in all periods and the $65 million gain recorded in 2011's second quarter related to the Wilmington Trust acquisition, noninterest income in the second quarter of 2012 aggregated $408 million, compared with $353 million in the year-earlier quarter and $388 million in the initial quarter of 2012. The recent quarter's improvement in noninterest income as compared with the earlier quarters resulted predominantly from higher mortgage banking revenues and trust income.
Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2012 totaled $627 million, compared with $577 million in the year-earlier quarter and $640 million in the first quarter of 2012. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses. Exclusive of those expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $604 million in the recent quarter, compared with $525 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $620 million in 2012's initial quarter. The most significant factor for the higher level of operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier quarter was the impact of the operations obtained in the Wilmington Trust acquisition. As compared with the first quarter of 2012, the recent quarter's lower level of operating expenses was due, in large part, to a decline in salaries and employee benefits, including stock-based compensation.
The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities and merger-related gains), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 56.9 in the second quarter of 2012, compared with 55.6% in the year-earlier period and 61.1% in the first quarter of 2012.

M&T had total assets of $80.8 billion at June 30, 2012, compared with $77.7 billion at June 30, 2011. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, increased $4.3 billion or 7% to $62.9 billion at the recent quarter-end, from $58.5 billion a year earlier. Total deposits rose 6% to $62.5 billion at June 30, 2012 from $59.2 billion at June 30, 2011.
Balance Sheet.
Total shareholders' equity increased 4% to $9.6 billion at June 30, 2012 from $9.2 billion a year earlier, representing 11.92% and 11.89%, respectively, of total assets. Common shareholders' equity was $8.8 billion, or $69.15 per share, at June 30, 2012, compared with $8.4 billion, or $66.71 per share, at June 30, 2011. Tangible equity per common share rose 8% to $40.52 at the recent quarter-end from $37.45 a year earlier. Common shareholders' equity per share and tangible equity per common share were $67.64 and $38.89, respectively, at March 31, 2012. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, common shareholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. M&T's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.65% at June 30, 2012, up from 6.35% and 6.51% at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2012, respectively. M&T's estimated Tier 1 common ratio, a regulatory capital measure, was 7.15% at June 30, 2012, improved from 6.67% and 7.04% at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2012, respectively.
