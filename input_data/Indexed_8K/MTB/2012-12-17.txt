(b) The Selling Security Holder covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that it will not prepare or have prepared on its behalf or use or refer to, any "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act), and agrees that it will not distribute any written materials in connection with the offer or sale of the Warrants without the prior approval of the Representative.

(ii) to reimburse each Underwriter, each Underwriter's directors and officers, and each such controlling person of any of them and the Selling Security Holder upon demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or any of them or the Selling Security Holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability, action or proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry related to the offering of the Warrants, whether or not such Underwriter or any of them or the Selling Security Holder
 
is a party to any action or proceeding. In the event that it is finally judicially determined that the Underwriters or the Selling Security Holder were not entitled to receive payments for legal and other expenses pursuant to this subparagraph, the Underwriters and Selling Security Holder will promptly return all sums that had been advanced pursuant hereto.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, the Selling Security Holder, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Selling Security Holder within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer, Selling Security Holder or controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, Selling Security Holder or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; , , that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Packagethe Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representative or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 13 herein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability such Underwriter may otherwise have.

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. No indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 8(c) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure
 
to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Section 8(a) or (b). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. The indemnified party or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party or such controlling person and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or such controlling person; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the indemnified party and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party with respect to such action or actions. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
 
received by the Company and the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Warrants. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Security Holder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Security Holder on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Warrants purchased by such Underwriter and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e) Any expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 8 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling any Underwriter, the Company, its directors or officers or any persons controlling the Company, (ii) acceptance of any Warrants and payment therefor hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
(f) The provisions of this Section 8 shall not be deemed to supersede or otherwise affect the Letter Agreement dated December 23, 2008 between the Company and the Selling Security Holder (and the Securities Purchase Agreement Standard Terms incorporated therein), pursuant to which the Selling Security Holder purchased the Warrants from the Company, with respect to the rights (including the rights of their respective agents) and obligations of each of them to the other pursuant thereto.

If during such 36 hours you, as such Representative, shall not have procured such other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase the Warrants agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then (a) if the aggregate number of Warrants with respect to which such default shall occur does not exceed 10% of the Warrants to be purchased on the Closing Date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in proportion to the respective numbers of Warrants they are obligated to purchase hereunder, to purchase the Warrants such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase, or (b) if the aggregate number of Warrants with respect to which such default shall occur exceeds 10% of the Warrants to be purchased on the Closing Date, the Selling Security Holder or you as the Representative will have the right, by written notice given within the next 36-hour period to the parties to this Agreement, to terminate this Agreement without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or of the Company or of the Selling Security Holder except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof. In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters, as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date may be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as you, as Representative, may determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. The term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter. Any action taken under this Section 9 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Agreement. All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned and any obligations of the undersigned shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the closing of the Public Offering has not occurred prior to the date two weeks after the date of this letter, this agreement shall be of no further force or effect.
