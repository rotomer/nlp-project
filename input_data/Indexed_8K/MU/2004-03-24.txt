hich ended March 4, 2004.  For the quarter, the Company had a net loss of $28 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on sales of $991 million.  These results compare to the second quarter of fiscal 2003 that had a net loss of $619 million on sales of $785 million and to the first quarter of fiscal 2004 that had net income of $1 million on sales of $1,107 million.

Boise, Idaho, March 24, 2004  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results of operations for its second quarter of fiscal 2004, w
 
The Company's megabit production of memory products in the second quarter measured on a weekly basis increased approximately 5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  The quarter over quarter megabit production increase was affected, and will likely continue to be affected in the near term, by increased allocations of wafers to the manufacture of CMOS image sensors, Pseudo SRAM devices, and Flash memory products.  A significant portion of the Company's production in the second quarter was based on 110 nanometer process technology as yields on these devices approached maturity.  While 256 Meg and higher density DRAM products comprised a majority of wafers processed in the period, approximately 20% of wafers processed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were comprised of lower density and relatively higher margin DRAM memory products.  Finished goods inventories at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were at relatively low levels.  Average selling prices for the Company's memory products for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company initiated a series of cost-reduction measures.

value of raw materials and work in process inventories associated with discontinued products.  The restructure charge includes the write-down of equipment of $54 million, severance and other termination benefits of $26 million, the write-off of certain intangible assets of $19 million, and other costs totaling $9 million.  The credit to restructure in the first six months of fiscal 2004 primarily reflects sales of equipment associated with the Company's 200 mm production line in Virginia.
 
Other operating (income) expense for the first six months of fiscal 2004 includes an $8 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates in the second quarter which offset a portion of the $25 million loss recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  Other operating income in the first six months of fiscal 2004 includes gains net of losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $8 million.  Other operating expense in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 includes losses of $13 million and $9 million, respectively, from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 includes $14 million in receipts from the U.S. Government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs.  Other operating expense in the first six months of fiscal 2003 also includes losses net of gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $11 million.

In connection with the Company's acquisition on April 22, 2002, of substantially all of the assets of Toshiba Corporation's ("Toshiba") DRAM business as conducted by Dominion semiconductor L.L.C., the Company issued to Toshiba 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock and granted Toshiba an option to require the Company to repurchase the shares for $67.5 million in cash on October 21, 2003.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, Toshiba exercised its option and the Company redeemed the 1.5 million shares.

On September 24, 2003, the Company received $450 million from Intel Corporation in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into 33.9 million shares of the Company's common stock.  In conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including certain levels of DDR2 production and 300 mm wafer processing capacity, and dedication of resources to advanced product development.  In the event the Company fails to achieve certain 2005 milestones and the Company's common stock price is then below Intel's purchase price, the Company could be obligated to pay Intel amounts not to exceed $135 million, a substantial portion of which is payable, at the Company's election, in the Company's common stock.  The shares issuable pursuant to the stock rights are included in weighted average common shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
