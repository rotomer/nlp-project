In its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 ("Recent Quarterly Report"), Micron Technology, Inc.

The Company is filing this current report of Form 8-K ("Current Report") to provide segment reporting financial information for the Memory and Imaging segments with respect to the historical financial information included in its Annual Report on From 10-K for the year ended September 1, 2005 (the "Annual Report") in order to make such historical financial information consistent with the segment presentation set forth in the Company's Recent Quarterly Report and consistent with how the Company expects to present its financial information in its future filings.  In addition, the Company has inserted a footnote entitled "Call Spread Options" into the consolidated financial statements included as Exhibit 99.4 to this Current Report.
 
For ease of reference, the Company is providing this additional segment reporting information by including such information in the following sections from its Annual Report:  Item 1 (Business), Item 7 (Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).  The additional information provided in this Current Report only reflects the Company's new segment reporting structure and the Call Spread Option footnote referred to above.

Overview
 
products are key components used in a broad array of electronic applications including personal computers, workstations, network servers, mobile phones, flash memory cards, USB storage devices, digital still cameras, MP3 players and other consumer electronics products.  The Company's customers are original equipment manufacturers located around the world.
The Company has two reportable segments, Memory and Imaging.  The Memory segment's primary products are DRAM and NAND Flash and the Imaging segment's primary product is CMOS image sensors.  The Company's
The Company is an industry leading, global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor devices, principally DRAM and NAND Flash memory, and CMOS image sensors. 
 
The Company's products are offered in a wide variety of package and configuration options, architectures, and performance characteristics tailored to meet application and customer needs.  Individual devices take advantage of the Company's advanced silicon processing technology and manufacturing expertise.  The Company continually introduces new generations of products that offer lower costs per unit and improved performance characteristics.
 
Products
 
The Company's memory segment has two primary product types:  DRAM and NAND Flash.
Memory Products: 
 
DRAM products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval.  DRAM products were 87%, 92% and 96% of the Company's total net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company offers DRAM products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics.  Historically, most of the Company's DRAM sales have been from standardized, high-density, high-volume products sold for use as main memory in computers.  With the development, introduction and acceptance of new memory architectures, computer main memory has transitioned in recent years from synchronous DRAM
Dynamic Random Access Memory ("DRAM")
:
 
("SDRAM") to Double Data Rate Synchronous DRAM ("DDR") and DDR2.  In 2005, the majority of the Company's DRAM revenue came from sales of DDR and DDR2 products for use in computer main memory.  In 2005, the Company experienced a significant increase in revenue from sales of specialty memory products (such as pseudo-static RAM ("PSRAM") and Mobile SDRAM) that are generally targeted to applications with specific performance characteristics such as low power, low latency, and high mobility.  The Company expects sales of these products to continue to increase in 2006.
 
 DDR and DDR2 are standardized, high-volume, DRAM products that are sold primarily for use as main system memory in computers.  DDR and DDR2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost compared to other semiconductor memory products.  DDR products were 44%, 57% and 57% of the Company's total net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  DDR2 products were 14% the Company's total net sales in 2005 and were 20% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2005.  DDR2 products are expected to become the Company's primary DRAM product in 2006.
DDR and DDR2:
 
In response to changes in the DRAM market, the Company has broadened its DDR and DDR2 product offerings in recent years.  The Company offers DDR products in 128 Meg, 256 Meg, 512 Meg and 1 Gig densities.  The Company also offers 256 Meg, 512 Meg and 1 Gig DDR2 products and has begun sampling 2 Gig DDR2.  The Company expects that these densities will be necessary to meet customers' demand in the future.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, 512 Meg devices replaced 256 Meg density devices as the Company's predominant density for DDR and DDR2 products.  The Company also offers its DDR and DDR2 products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types.
 
In 2005, SDRAM was primarily used in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and computer peripherals as well as upgrades to legacy computers.  Sales of SDRAM products were 20%, 31% and 37% of the Company's total net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  SDRAM sales have declined as personal computer manufacturers have transitioned to DDR and DDR2 products; the decline has been partially offset by increased usage of SDRAM products in other applications.  The Company offers 64 Meg, 128 Meg, 256 Meg and 512 Meg SDRAM products.
SDRAM: 
 
  PSRAM products, marketed by the Company under the proprietary brand name CellularRAM, are DRAM products with an SRAM-like interface.  PSRAM combines the minimal power consumption of SRAM with a much lower cost-per-bit to provide an economical alternative to SRAM.  PSRAM products are used primarily in cellular phone applications.  The Company offers PSRAM products in 16 Meg, 32 Meg, 64 Meg and 128 Meg densities.  Sales of PSRAM products increased significantly in 2005 and were 7% of the Company's total net sales in 2005.
PSRAM:
 
  Mobile DRAM products are specialty DRAM memory devices designed for applications that demand minimal power consumption, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones, GPS devices, digital still cameras and other handheld electronic devices.  Sales of Mobile DRAM products grew significantly to 2% of the Company's total net sales in 2005 and are expected to continue to grow in 2006.  The Company sells SDRAM and DDR Mobile memory products in 64 Meg, 128 Meg, 256 Meg and 512 Meg densities.  The Company's mobile DRAM products feature its proprietary Endur-IC technology, which the Company believes provides distinct advantages to its customers in terms of low power, high quality, high reliability, and overall robustness.
Mobile DRAM:
 
  RLDRAM products are low-latency DRAM memory devices with high clock rates targeted at network applications.  The Company began shipping commercial volumes of RLDRAM products in 2005.

("
 
  Flash memory products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor devices that retain memory content when power is turned off.  The Company's Flash efforts are concentrated on NAND Flash ("NAND") devices which use semiconductor technology similar to DRAM.  NAND offers faster erase and write times, higher density, and lower cost per bit than NOR Flash, which is the primary competing Flash architecture.  In addition, NAND has significantly longer cycle endurance making it ideal for mass-storage devices.  The market for NAND products has grown rapidly and the Company expects it to continue to grow due to demand for removable and embedded storage devices.  Removable storage devices such as USB and Flash memory cards are used with applications such as personal computers, digital still cameras, MP3 players and mobile phones.  Embedded NAND-based storage devices are also beginning to be utilized in mobile phones and other personal and consumer applications.
NAND Flash Memory:
he Company to leverage its product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across product lines.  The Company's NAND designs feature a small cell structure that allows for higher densities for demanding applications.  In the second quarter of 2005, the Company began shipping its first NAND product, a 2 Gig device incorporating the Company's 90nm process technology.  NAND sales grew to 6% of the Company's total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2005.  In 2006, the Company plans to introduce 1 Gig and 4 Gig NAND products and begin manufacturing NAND products using 72nm process technology.  The Company expects sales of NAND to continue to increase in 2006 as the Company allocates additional manufacturing resources to NAND production.
NAND and DRAM share common manufacturing processes, enabling t
 
  CMOS image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications.  The Company's CMOS image sensors are used in products such as cellular phone cameras, digital still cameras, pill cameras for medical use, automotive and other emerging applications.  The Company offers image sensors in a range of pixel resolutions from its VGA (video graphics array) products to its higher resolution 3.1 megapixel products.  In September 2005, the Company introduced a 5 megapixel sensor designed for use in digital still cameras and camera phones and a 3.1 megapixel designed specifically for camera phones.  These products feature a leading-edge pixel size of 2.2 square microns, enabling a smaller form factor for the sensor.  The Company expects to begin shipping commercial volumes of these products in 2006.  Image sensors are sold either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry to create complete camera system-on-a-chip ("SOC") solutions.  In 2005, the Company's image sensors were primarily used in mobile applications.
Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor ("CMOS") Image Sensors:
 
DigitalClarity technology have many advantages over other CMOS image sensors and charge-coupled device ("CCD") sensors.  The Company's DigitalClarity technology features "active pixels" enabling better sensor performance that produces higher-quality images at faster frame rates.  Unlike CCD sensors, which rely on specialized fabrication requiring dedicated, and costly manufacturing processes, CMOS image sensors can be manufactured using standardized semiconductor processes resulting in substantially lower costs.  The Company's low-leakage DRAM processes are particularly well-suited for the manufacture of CMOS image sensors.  The Company's CMOS image sensors consume substantially less power than CCD devices, a critical advantage in the battery-dependent portable device applications where most image sensors are used.  By combining all camera functions on a single chip, from the capture of photons to the output of digital bits, CMOS image sensors reduce the part-count of a digital camera system, which in turn increases reliability, eases miniaturization, and enables on-chip programming of frame size, windowing, exposure, and other camera parameters.  The Company's CMOS image sensors are also capable of producing high-quality images in low-light conditions.  The Company's CMOS image sensors' active-pixel design architecture enables them to achieve performance comparable to high-end CCD sensors and higher than competitor's CMOS image sensors.
The Company's CMOS image sensors incorporating its
 
The Company expects its sales of CMOS image sensors to continue to grow rapidly in 2006 due to strong demand and increases in the allocation of manufacturing capacity.  The overall market for image sensors is expected to increase significantly over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras.  Additionally, CMOS image sensors are expected to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image sensor market.
The Company's sales of CMOS image sensors for 2005 increased over 200% from 2004.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, sales of CMOS image sensors were 9% of the Company's total net sales. 
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company's manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico, Scotland and Singapore.  The Company's manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment.  Most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment.
 
he Company manufactured most of its products using its 110 nanometer ("nm") line-width process technology and began transferring its manufacturing operations to 95nm line-width process technology.  The Company expects to continue to transfer more of its manufacturing operation to 95nm and lower line-width process technology in 2006.  In 2005 most of the Company's DRAM products
The Company's process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, burn-in and final test.  Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities.  The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer.  Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment.  The Company is continuously enhancing production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products.  In 2005, t

Despite stringent manufacturing controls, dust particles, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects which can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional.  Success of the Company's manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of high-quality circuits.  In this regard, the Company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes.  The Company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.
 
ine pitch ball grid array).  Each completed package is then inspected and tested.  The Company also sells semiconductor products in an unpackaged or die form.  The Company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process, performs high temperature burn-in on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow.  In addition, the Company uses its proprietary AMBYX line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of DRAM die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.
After fabrication, silicon wafers are separated into individual die.  Functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages.  The Company assembles products in a variety of packages, including TSOP (thin small outline package), TQFP (thin quad flat package) and FBGA (f
 
A significant portion of the Company's memory products are assembled into memory modules for sale to customers.  Memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards ("PCBs") that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices.  Memory components are attached to PCBs in a soldering process performed by screen printing machines and high speed automated pick-and-place machines.  Completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected.
 
In 2005, the Company significantly increased its 300mm wafer production.  The Company manufactured 256 Meg and 512 Meg DDR devices on the Company's 110nm process technology on 300mm wafers, and manufactured the industry's first memory devices in production to utilize copper interconnects.  In 2006, the Company plans to continue increasing its 300mm wafer manufacturing capacity.
 
In recent years the Company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances the Company's ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of the manufacturing process.  Although new product lines such as NAND Flash, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the Company's predominant DRAM products, frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts can affect the Company's cost efficiency.  However, the Company's ability to competitively manufacture many of these products on existing 200mm lines significantly extends the useful life of this equipment.
 
TECH is a memory manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among Micron Technology, Inc., the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company.  TECH's semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company's product and process technology.  Subject to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH.  TECH supplied approximately 25%, 30% and 30% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the preceding fiscal quarter.  The Company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by TECH.  The Company also provides certain technology, engineering and training to support TECH.  All of these transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH.
TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH"): 
 
Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company's production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several that are customized for, or unique to, the Company.  The Company generally has multiple sources of supply; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the Company's standards.  Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames, molding compound
and other materials.  In addition, any transportation problems could delay the Company's receipt of raw materials.  Although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the Company's operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future.  Also, lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past.  If the Company's supply of raw materials is interrupted, or lead times are extended, results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
The Company's products are sold into computing and consumer, networking and telecommunications, and imaging markets.  Approximately 70% of the Company's net sales for 2005 were to the computing market, including desktop PCs, notebooks, servers and workstations.  Sales to both Dell Computer Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company exceeded 10% of the Company's net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and aggregated 23%, 27% and 28% of the Company's net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
The Company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force.  The Company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments.  The Company's products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors and Crucial Technology, the Company's web-based customer direct sales division.  The Company's products are offered under the Micron, SpecTek and Crucial brand names, and under other private labels.  The Company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world.  Independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the Company and are compensated on a commission basis.  The Company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer.  Distributors carry the Company's products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products.
 
Segmentation of the memory market continues, with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of personal computers, servers, mobile devices, and communications, consumer and other applications that demand specific memory solutions.  Many of the Company's customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months.  As the Company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing memory products, more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the Company.
 
Backlog
 
Volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts.  Accordingly, new order volumes for the Company's semiconductor products fluctuate significantly.  Orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment.  Customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty.  For these reasons, the Company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
 
Product Warranty
 
Because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that the Company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses.  In accordance with industry practice, the Company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with Company specifications existing at the time of delivery.  Under the Company's general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances the Company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the Company's general terms and conditions.
 
Competition
 
The Company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies, including Elpida Memory, Inc., Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Infineon Technologies AG and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, SanDisk Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.  Additionally, the Company faces competition from emerging companies in Taiwan and China who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations.  The Company faces competition in the
image sensor market from a number of suppliers of CMOS image sensors as well a large number of suppliers of CCD image sensors.  Some of the Company's competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the Company competes, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities.  The Company's competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs.  These factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices.
 
Research and Development
 
To compete in the semiconductor memory industry, the Company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes.  The Company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions.  The Company has several product design centers around the world, the largest located at its corporate headquarters in Boise, Idaho.  In addition, the Company has a facility at its Boise site to develop leading edge photolithography mask technology.
 
R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the Company's products, the Company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers.  R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.  Product development costs are recorded as R&D expense.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for the year ended September 1, 2005.  All period references are to the Company's fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.  All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.  All tabular dollar amounts are in millions.  Unless otherwise stated, all production data reflects production of the Company and its TECH joint venture.
 
Overview
 
The Company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices, principally DRAM, NAND Flash, and CMOS image sensors.  Its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers, workstations, network servers, mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards, USB storage devices, digital still camera and MP3 players.  The Company's customers are principally original equipment manufacturers located around the world.  The Company's success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified semiconductor product portfolio, efficient utilization of the Company's manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development efforts.
 
The Company has strategically diversified its business by expanding into semiconductor products such as specialty memory products (including SDRAM, PSRAM, mobile SDRAM and reduced latency DRAM), NAND Flash memory products and CMOS image sensors.  These products are used in a wider range of applications than the computing applications that use the Company's standardized DRAM products.  The Company leverages its expertise in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and process technology to provide these products that are differentiated from competitors' products based on performance characteristics.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, specialty memory products, NAND Flash products and CMOS image sensors were over 45% of the Company's net sales.  The Company expects that the markets for these products will grow more rapidly than the overall semiconductor market in the near term.  The Company's products have been well received in these growing customer applications.  The Company plans to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to support these products and expand its market position in 2006.  The Company believes that the strategic diversification of its product portfolio will strengthen its ability to allocate manufacturing resources to obtain the highest rate of return.
 
The Company makes significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in its manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia to provide semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs.  The Company introduces new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption and increased megapixel count.  The Company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through its advanced product and process technology such as its leading-edge line width process technology and innovative array architecture.
 
In order to maximize returns from investments in research and development ("R&D"), the Company develops process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the Company's capital expenditures.  To be successfully incorporated in customers' end products, the Company must offer qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications for their end products.  This is especially true for specialty memory products and CMOS image sensors which are required to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance well ahead of a planned ramp of production to commercial volumes.  In addition, DRAM and NAND Flash products often incorporate highly advanced design and process technologies that are difficult to manufacture.  The Company must make significant investments in R&D to expand its product offering and develop its leading-edge product and process technologies.
Results of Operations
 
 
The Company's two reportable segments are Memory and Imaging.  The Memory segment's primary products are DRAM and NAND Flash memory and the Imaging segment's primary product is CMOS image sensors.  The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.  The Company's fiscal 2005 and 2003 contained 52 weeks.  The Company's fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks.
 
Net Sales
 
Total net sales for 2005 increased 11% as compared to 2004 due to a 6% increase in Memory sales and 207% increase in Imaging sales.  The Company was able to achieve increases in sales for both segments primarily as a result of increases in sales volume facilitated by increases in production.  Average selling prices for 2005 declined 24% for Memory products and were essentially unchanged for Imaging products as compared to 2004.  Memory sales were 94% of total net sales in 2005 compared to 98% in 2004 and 99% in 2003.  Imaging sales have grown rapidly in recent periods and have represented an increasing portion of the Company's total net sales.  Total net sales for 2004 increased 42% as compared to 2003 due to a 40% increase in Memory sales and a 506% increase in Imaging sales.
 
Memory sales for 2005 increased by 6% as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 40% increase in megabits sold, partially offset by a 24% decrease in the overall average selling price per megabit for the Company's Memory products.    The Company's overall megabit production in 2005 increased by 48% as compared to 2004, principally due to a steep ramp in 300mm wafer production and gains in manufacturing efficiencies realized from improvements in product and process technologies.  The Company realized a significant increase in 300mm wafer production in 2005, achieving its initial target of 5,000 wafer outs per week in the fourth quarter.  The Company expects that its 300mm wafer production will continue to increase in 2006.  The Company's megabit production exceeded megabit sales in 2005, which resulted in an approximate 170% increase in megabit finished goods inventories, primarily consisting of DDR and DDR2 products.  The increase in inventories was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industry-wide transition to DDR2 memory products.
Memory:
 
 
Most of the increase in Memory sales in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from sales of the Company's emerging specialty memory products, such as pseudo-static RAM ("PSRAM") and mobile DRAM products and NAND Flash memory.  The Company's combined revenue from these products was $509.2 million in 2005 and nearly quintupled from 2004 due to large increases in production and strong demand for the Company's offerings in these product groups.  The Company expects that its revenue from these products will continue to grow rapidly in 2006 as it allocates increasing manufacturing resources to these product groups.  DDR and DDR2 product sales in 2005 increased 12% from 2004 and were 59% of the Company's total net sales in 2005.  Sales of DDR2 products increased to 14% of the Company's total net sales in 2005 from 1% of total net sales in 2004.  The Company expects that sales of DDR2 products will continue to increase in 2006 as market demand continues to shift from DDR products to more advanced DDR2 products.
 
Memory sales for 2004 increased by 40% as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 20% increase in megabits sold and a 16% increase in average per megabit selling prices as a result of generally improved market conditions.  During 2004, the Company increased its allocation of manufacturing capacity to specialty memory products and CMOS image sensors.  The shift in product mix contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for 2004 as specialty memory products on average had higher selling prices per megabit than the Company's DDR and DDR2 products.  The Company's overall megabit
production for 2004 increased approximately 23% from 2003 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies.  The growth rate in megabit production for 2004 was partially mitigated by the allocation of wafers to CMOS image sensors and specialty memory products.
 
Imaging sales for 2005 increased by 207% as compared to 2004 primarily due to increases in unit sales as average selling price per unit were essentially unchanged.  The growth in Imaging unit sales for 2005 reflects increased production and strong demand for the Company's products.  Production increased due to the allocation of more wafers to the manufacture of Imaging products as well as improvements in manufacturing efficiency.  Imaging sales were 6% of the Company's total net sales in 2005 and 9% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Imaging sales for 2004 were more than six times Imaging sales for 2003, as the Company significantly increased production of Imaging products.  Due to strong demand for the Company's products and the planned introduction of new products, the Company expects that revenue from Imaging products will continue to grow in future periods as additional manufacturing capacity is allocated to the production of these products.
Imaging: 
 
Gross Margin
 
The Company's overall gross margin percentage for 2005 declined to 24% as compared to 30% for 2004.  This decline in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a decline in gross margin for Memory products, which was due to decreases in average selling prices per megabit.  Partially offsetting the effect of the decline in average selling prices 2004 to 2005 was a reduction in cost of goods sold per megabit and the increase in sales of CMOS image sensors, specialty memory and NAND Flash products, which had significantly higher margins than DDR and DDR2 products.  The Company's overall gross margin percentage for 2004 increased to 30% from a negative 1% for 2003 primarily due to improved average selling prices and cost reductions for Memory products.
 
The Company's gross margin percentage for Memory products for 2005 declined to 22% as compared to 30% for 2004.  This decline in gross margin was primarily due to the 24% decrease in the Company's overall average selling price per megabit of memory and, to a lesser extent, a shift in product mix from DDR to DDR2 products which had lower margins in 2005.  Partially offsetting this decline in gross margin from 2005 to 2004 was a reduction in cost of goods sold per megabit and the increase in sales of specialty memory and NAND Flash products, which had significantly higher margins than DDR and DDR2 products.
Memory: 
 
110nm process technology and 6F technology.  The cost per megabit for products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 as the Company continued to increase 300mm wafer production, reaching its initial target of 5,000 wafer outs per week.  Manufacturing costs per megabit for DDR2 products were higher than the Company's DDR products in 2005 because of DDR2's relatively larger die size.  The Company expects that per megabit cost reductions in 2006 will continue to be mitigated by shifts in product mix from DDR to DDR2.
The Company's overall cost of goods sold per megabit in 2005 declined from 2004 primarily due to manufacturing improvements.  The Company reduced product costs through manufacturing efficiencies achieved from improved product yield and increase in production utilizing the Company's
 
continuing its transition to products utilizing 110nm process technology and 6F technology.
The Company's gross margin percentage for Memory products improved to 30% for 2004 from a negative 1% for 2003 primarily due to the 16% increase in average per megabit selling prices and reduced costs per megabit.  In addition, compared to 2003, Memory product's gross margin for 2004 benefited from relatively higher margins on sales of products purchased from the Company's TECH joint venture.  The Company reduced its overall average cost per megabit for 2004 as compared to 2003 through manufacturing efficiencies achieved by improving product yields and
 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company recorded $307.0 million of charges to cost of goods sold in 2003 to write down the carrying values of work in process and finished goods inventories to their estimated market values.  As these charges were recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write-down was sold, gross margins in the period of sale were higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write-downs.  The Company did not record any charges for inventory write-downs in 2005 and 2004.  Costs of goods sold in 2004 were $61.0 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of write-downs in prior periods.  Costs of goods sold in 2003 were $174.9 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of write-downs in prior periods net of the write-downs in 2003.  Substantially all of the inventory write-downs in 2004 and 2003 were for Memory products.
 
TECH joint venture supplied approximately 25%, 30% and 30% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company generally purchases memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the

immediately preceding quarter.  Depending on market conditions, the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by TECH may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the Company's wholly-owned operations.  In 2005, the Company realized gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products that were approximately the same as for the DDR and DDR2 products manufactured by its wholly-owned operations.  In
 
  The Company's gross margin for Imaging products increased to 41% for 2005 from 25% for 2005 primarily due to cost reductions as the overall average selling price per unit was essentially unchanged.  The Company's gross margin for Imaging products decreased to 25% for 2004 as compared to 30% for 2003 primarily due to shifts in product mix.
Imaging:
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for 2005 increased 5% from 2004 primarily due to higher compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with legal matters.  SG&A expenses for 2004 were 7% lower than for 2003 primarily due to lower costs associated with outstanding legal matters and reduced depreciation costs, partially offset by higher levels of performance-based compensation expense and other personnel costs.
 
Research and Development
 
R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs.  Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products, the Company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing.  The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.
 
R&D expenses for 2005 decreased 20% from 2004 principally because products were qualified on the 300mm wafer fabrication process in the first quarter of 2005.  When products are qualified, the Company includes costs from the production of these products in inventory and costs of goods sold rather than research and development expense.  Higher compensation costs partially offset the decreases in R&D expenses for 2005 as compared to 2004.  R&D expenses for 2004 increased 15% from 2003 principally due to an increase in development wafers processed during 2004 as the Company increased its product diversification and ramped production at its 300mm wafer fabrication facility, which primarily ran development wafers in 2004.  Higher R&D costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 also reflected a higher level of expenses related to CMOS image sensors, Flash memory and specialty memory products.
 
and reduced latency DRAM) and new manufacturing materials.  Efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the Company's 1 Gig and 2 Gig DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 products as well as high density and mobile NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory products.
The Company's process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm, 78nm, 65nm and smaller DRAM and 90nm, 72nm, 50nm and smaller NAND Flash line-width process technologies, which are designed to facilitate the Company's transition to next generation products.  Additional R&D efforts include process development to support the Company's 300mm wafer manufacturing, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors, specialty memory products (including PSRAM, mobile SDRAM
 
Restructure and Other Charges
 
The Company substantially completed the restructure plan and paid essentially all costs associated with the restructure plan in 2004 and 2003.
In 2003, the Company announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives.  The restructure plan included the shutdown of the Company's 200mm production line in Virginia; the discontinuance of certain memory products, including SRAM and TCAM; and an approximate 10% reduction in the Company's worldwide workforce.  In 2003, the Company recorded restructure charges of $109.2 million and other restructure-related charges of $7.1 million, including $50.7 million of equipment write-downs, $26.3 million of severance and other termination benefits and $18.6 million of intangible asset write downs.  Substantially all of the restructure charges were in the Memory segment.  The Company recorded net credits to restructure of $1.4 million and $22.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily from sales of equipment associated with the Company's 200mm production line in Virginia. 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."  SFAS No. 123(R) will require the Company to use a fair-value based method of accounting for share-based compensation beginning in 2006.  Through 2005 the Company used the intrinsic-value method to account for stock-based compensation and generally no compensation costs were recorded.  Accordingly, the Company's implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) will increase compensation costs reflected in cost of goods sold, SG&A and R&D in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods.
 
In April of 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 44.6 million unvested stock options outstanding under the Company's stock plans to reduce compensation costs that would have been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements after 2005 with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) by approximately $100 million.  As of September 1, 2005, 3% of the Company's then outstanding stock options were unvested and the expense for these unvested stock options to be recorded in 2006 through 2009 is $10.4 million.  Because the Company's near-term, stock-based compensation costs were reduced by the acceleration of vesting, share-based compensation costs could grow significantly in future periods if the Company continues to grant amounts of new share-based compensation awards similar to recent periods.
 
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
 
Other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of $17.2 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating income for 2004 includes $7.2 million from the Commonwealth of Virginia for meeting investment commitments at the Virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of $3.9 million on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment.  Other operating expense for 2003 includes net losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million and losses of $10.7 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating expense for 2003 is net of $14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs.  The Company estimates that, based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar as of September 1, 2005, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $1 million for the yen and $1 million for the euro.
Other operating income for 2005 includes net gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $12.7 million and $12.0 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs. 
 
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes for 2005, 2004 and 2003 primarily reflect taxes on the Company's non-U.S. operations.  The Company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its U.S. operations.  The provision for taxes on U.S. operations in 2005 and 2004 was substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance.  Until such time as the Company utilizes its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits, the provision for taxes on the Company's U.S. operations is expected to be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.5 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $140.7 million.  The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion and unused state tax credits of $137.5 million.  Substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2025.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The Company's liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products and the timing of capital expenditures, both of which can vary significantly from period to period.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had cash and marketable investment securities totaling $1,290.4 million compared to $1,231.0 million as of September 2, 2004.
 
  For 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,237.8 million, which principally reflects the Company's $188.0 million of net income adjusted by $1,264.5 million for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense.  Cash provided by operations was reduced by a $193.3 million increase in inventories.  The increase in inventories was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industry-wide transition to DDR2 memory products.
Operating Activities:
 
  For 2005, net cash used by investing activities was $1,083.9 million, which included cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $1,064.8 million.  The Company believes that to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, it must continue to
Investing Activities:
invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technologies.  The Company projects 2006 capital spending of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had commitments extending into 2007 of approximately $250 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.
 
  For 2005, net cash used by financing activities was $115.5 million.  Payments on debt were $300.0 million for 2005, and included prepayment of the $210.0 million outstanding on the Company's subordinated notes that were due September 2005.  Payments on equipment purchase contracts were $236.0 million for 2005.  In the third quarter of 2005, the Company obtained an aggregate of 23.5 billion yen ($221.4 million) from two yen-denominated loan financing arrangements that are payable in semi-annual installments through 2010.  In 2005, the Company received $161.3 million in proceeds from sales-leaseback transactions which are payable in periodic installments through January 2009.
Financing Activities:
 
In 2004, the Company received $450.0 million from Intel in exchange for stock rights exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company's common stock.  Additionally, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives or be subject to monetary penalties.  The Company has achieved operational objectives and does not expect to make any payments to Intel under this agreement.
 
Access to capital markets has historically been important to the Company.  Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time, issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion of its operations.
 
As of September 1, 2005, the Company had $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") outstanding.  Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes.  This conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share.  The Company may redeem the Notes at any time after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.
 
  The following table summarizes the Company's significant contractual obligations at September 1, 2005, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Company's liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
Contractual Obligations:
 
 
The obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the Company's balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long-term debt.  The expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information.  Timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
 
Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) the Company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled, or (3) the Company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services ("take-or-pay").  If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table.  If the obligation is cancelable, but the Company would incur a penalty if cancelled, the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation.  Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.
 
The Company has an agreement with its TECH joint venture to purchase all of TECH's output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions.  As the purchase quantities are based on qualified production output, the agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore the Company did not include the agreement in its purchase obligations.  In addition to purchase quantities, the TECH purchase obligation fluctuates based on average selling
prices for semiconductor memory components which can change significantly from period to period.  In 2005, the net cost of semiconductor components purchased from TECH was $651.9 million.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
off-balance sheet arrangements:  convertible debt, call spread options, stock warrants and its variable interest in the TECH joint venture.
As of September 1, 2005, the Company had the following
 
See "Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a description of the Company's convertible debt.
 
Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the "Call Spread Options") covering 53.7 million shares of the Company's common stock, which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in full.  The Call Spread Options have a lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled at the Company's option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29, 2008.  Settlement of the Call Spread Options in cash on January 29, 2008, would result in the Company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company's common stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market price per share of the Company's common stock is at or above $18.19.
 
In 2001, the Company received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the Company's common stock.  The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the "Exercise Price") at any time through May 15, 2008 (the "Expiration Date").  Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration Date will be settled on a "net share" basis, wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date.  At expiration, the Company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  As of September 1, 2005, there had been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remained outstanding.
 
See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Joint Venture" for a description of the Company's arrangement with its TECH joint venture.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections."  SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 154 for accounting changes and error corrections that occur after the beginning of 2007.  The Company's results of operations and financial condition will only be impacted following the adoption of SFAS No. 154 if it implements changes in accounting principle that are addressed by the standard or corrects accounting errors in future periods.
 
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement.  The Company is required to adopt Interpretation No. 47 prior to the end of 2006.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of Interpretation No. 47 on its results of operations and financial condition.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."  SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions) and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  In March 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued SAB 107 which expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R).  Among other things, SAB 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations as well as provides the SEC staff's views regarding the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements for public companies.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) in the beginning of 2006.  Upon adoption, the Company will record non-cash stock compensation expense primarily associated with future grants of stock options, which will have an adverse effect on its results of operations.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets  An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29," which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 153 for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the first quarter of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs  An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4," which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage).  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 151 in the beginning of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  Management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.
 
  The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies.  An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date.
Contingencies:
 
The Company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.  Estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex.  Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.  The Company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of the Company's performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets.  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income.
Income taxes:
 
 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value.  Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories.  To project average selling prices and sales volumes, the Company reviews recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information.  When these analyses reflect estimated market values below the Company's manufacturing costs, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.  Differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.  Due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.
Inventories:
 
U.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values.  The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories.  The Company's inventory has been categorized as semiconductor memory products or CMOS image sensors.  The major characteristics the Company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.
 
  Costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years.
Product and process technology:
The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed.  Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement.
 
The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition.  In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the Company, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for Company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for the Company's products and future production and sales volumes.  In addition, judgment is required by the Company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.
Property, plant and equipment: 
 
  Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred.  Determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the Company.  The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.

Significant Accounting Policies
 
  Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Company") manufacture and market DRAM, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and other semiconductor components.  The Company has two reportable segments, Memory and Imaging.   The Memory segment's primary products are DRAM and NAND Flash and the Imaging segment's primary product is CMOS image sensors.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Basis of presentation:
 
The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.  The Company's fiscal 2005 and 2003 contained 52 weeks.  The Company's fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks.  All period references are to the Company's fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.
 
Certain reclassifications have been made, none of which affected results of operations, to present the financial statements on a consistent basis.
Reclassifications: 
 
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  Actual results could differ from estimates.
Use of estimates:
 
Approximately 70% of the Company's net sales for 2005 were to the computing market, including desktop PCs, notebooks, servers and workstations.  Sales to one customer were 12.2%, 14.1 % and 14.9% of the Company's net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Sales to another customer were 11.3%, 13.2% and 13.2% of the Company's net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Sales of DRAM products constituted 87% of the Company's net sales for 2005 and no other product group individually constituted greater than 10% of the Company's net sales.  Certain components used by the Company in manufacturing semiconductor products are available from a limited number of suppliers.
Certain concentrations: 
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investment securities and trade receivables.  The Company invests through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor.  A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to trade receivables as a substantial portion of the Company's customers are affiliated with the computing industry.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally does not require collateral from its customers.  Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on receivables.
 
  The Company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with Company specifications existing at the time of delivery.  Under the Company's general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items.  Under certain circumstances, the Company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose upon the Company more extensive liability than that provided under the Company's general terms and conditions.  The Company's warranty obligations are not material.
Product warranty:
 
The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Because of frequent changes in market prices for the Company's products, sales made under agreements allowing pricing protection or rights of return (other than for product warranty) are deferred until customers have sold the product.
Revenue recognition:
 
  Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred.  Determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the Company.  The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.
Research and development:
  Through 2005, the Company's employee stock plans were accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value stock options for pro forma presentation of income and per share data as if the fair value based method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," had been used to account for stock-based compensation.  The following presents pro forma income (loss) and per share data as if a fair value based method had been used to account for stock-based compensation:
Stock-based compensation:
 
Stock-based compensation expense in the above presentation does not reflect any significant income taxes, which is consistent with the Company's treatment of income or loss from its U.S. operations.  (See "Income Taxes" note.)
 
On April 4, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 44.6 million unvested stock options outstanding under the Company's stock plans with exercise prices per share of $12.00 or higher.  The options had a range of exercise prices of $12.00 to $44.90 and a weighted average exercise price of $14.08.  The closing price of the Company's common stock on April 1, 2005, the last trading day before the acceleration, was $10.26.  The acceleration was effective as of April 4, 2005.  The purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).  The aggregate pre-tax expense associated with the accelerated options that would have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future fiscal years was approximately $100 million, which is included in pro forma stock-based employee compensation expense for 2005.
 
  The U.S. dollar is the Company's functional currency for substantially all of its operations.
Functional currency:
 
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares and stock rights outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effects of stock options, warrants and convertible notes.  Potential common shares that would increase earnings per share amounts or decrease loss per share amounts are antidilutive and are, therefore, excluded from earnings per share calculations.  Basic and diluted earnings per share computations reflect the effect of accretion of, and fair value adjustment to, redeemable common stock.
Earnings per share: 
 
  Cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less, readily convertible to known amounts of cash.  Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments.  Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as other noncurrent assets.  Securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at market value.  The carrying value of investment securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.
Financial instruments:
 
The amounts reported as cash and equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and equipment purchase contracts approximate their fair values.  The estimated fair value of the Company's debt was $1.2 billion as of September 1, 2005 and September 2, 2004.  The fair value estimates presented herein were based on market interest rates and other market information available to management as of each balance sheet date presented.  The use
of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  The approximate fair values do not take into consideration expenses that could be incurred in an actual settlement.
 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value.  Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories.  As a result of these analyses, when market values are below the Company's costs, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.
Inventories:
 
  Costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years.  The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed.  Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement.  Fully-amortized costs are removed from product and process technology and accumulated amortization.
Product and process technology:
 
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 30 years for buildings, 2 to 20 years for equipment and 2 to 5 years for software.  Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are included in other noncurrent assets.  When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the net book value of the asset is removed from the Company's accounts and any net gain or loss is included in the Company's results of operations.
Property, plant and equipment:
 
The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets.  The Company capitalized interest costs of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $3.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in connection with various capital projects.
 
  In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections."  SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes", and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 154 for accounting changes and error corrections that occur after the beginning of 2007.  The Company's results of operations and financial condition will only be impacted following the adoption of SFAS No. 154 if it implements changes in accounting principle that are addressed by the standard or corrects accounting errors in future periods.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards:
 
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement.  The Company is required to adopt Interpretation No. 47 prior to the end of 2006.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of Interpretation No. 47 on its results of operations and financial condition.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."  SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions) and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  In March 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued SAB 107 which expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R).  Among other things, SAB 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations as well as provides the SEC staff's views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) in the beginning of 2006.  Upon adoption, the Company will record non-cash stock compensation expense primarily associated with future grants of stock options, which will have an adverse effect on its results of operations.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets  An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29," which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  The Company is required to
adopt SFAS No. 153 for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the first quarter of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs  An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4," which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage).  The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 151 in the beginning of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

Gross unrealized gains and losses as of the end of the periods shown above were de minimis as were gross realized gains and losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003.  Debt securities of $995.2 million held by the Company as of September 1, 2005, have contractual maturities within one year.
 
 
 
 
The Company recognized write-downs aggregating $307.0 million in 2003 to record work in process and finished goods inventories at their estimated market values.
 
During 2005, the Company capitalized $34.7 million for product and process technology with a weighted average useful life of ten years.  During 2004, the Company capitalized $37.0 million for product and process technology with a weighted average useful life of ten years.  As part of a restructure plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company wrote off net carrying values of $16.1 million of product and process technology and $2.5 million of other intangible assets associated with discontinued products, including SRAM and TCAM products.  (See "Restructure and Other Charges" note.)
 
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $50.8 million, $50.3 million and $51.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Annual amortization expense for intangible assets held as of September 1, 2005, is estimated to be $51.1 million for 2006, $49.2 million for 2007, $48.5 million for 2008, $37.5 million for 2009 and $29.0 million for 2010.
 
 
Depreciation expense was $1,211.4 million, $1,166.3 million and $1,157.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
The Company has a manufacturing facility in Utah that is only partially utilized.  The Utah facility had a net book value of $683.7 million as of September 1, 2005.  A portion of the Utah facility is being used for component test operations.  The Company is depreciating substantially all assets at the Utah facility other than $192.1 million included in construction in progress as of September 1, 2005.  Increased utilization of the facility is dependent upon market conditions, including, but not limited to, worldwide market supply of, and demand for, semiconductor products and the Company's operations, cash flows and alternative capacity utilization opportunities.
 
As part of a restructure plan announced in the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded impairment charges of $42.6 million in 2003 to writedown the carrying value of certain assets used in the Company's 200mm production line in Virginia, which was shut down as part of the restructure plan.  (See "Restructure and Other Charges" note.)
 
 
In the third quarter of 2005, the Company entered into two yen-dominated loans aggregating 23.5 billion yen ($221.4 million), payable in semi-annual installments through 2010.  The first, a syndicated term loan for 13.5 billion yen bears interest at the 6-month Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ("TIBOR") plus 1.25% (1.35% as of September 1, 2005) and requires the Company to maintain a deposit with the lead bank ($14.5 million as of September 1, 2005), which is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The second loan for 10.0 billion yen bears interest at a fixed rate of 0.95% and is collateralized by certain equipment owned by the Company.
 
As of September 1, 2005, notes payable of $298.9 million denominated in Japanese yen were at a weighted average interest rate of 1.2%.
 
In 2005, the Company received $161.3 million in proceeds from sales-leaseback transactions and as a result recorded capital lease obligations aggregating $157.3 million with a weighted average imputed interest rate of 6.3%, payable in periodic installments through January 2009.
 
In February 2003, the Company issued $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due February 1, 2010 (the "Notes").  Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes.  This conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share.  The Company may redeem the notes at any time after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par.
 
Certain notes payable are collateralized by property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of $302.3 million as of September 1, 2005.  Equipment under capital leases and accumulated amortization thereon were $253.8 million and $73.8 million, respectively, as of September 1, 2005, and $108.1 million and $38.0 million, respectively, as of September 2, 2004.
 
As of September 1, 2005, maturities of notes payable and future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations were as follows:
 
Interest Rate Swap:
 The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "Swap") that effectively converted, beginning August 29, 2003, the fixed interest rate on the Company's 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") to a variable interest rate based on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") less 65 basis points (average rate of 1.99% for 2005).  The Swap qualifies as a fair-value hedge under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.  The gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the Notes attributable to changes in interest rates.  The Company measures the effectiveness of the Swap using regression analysis.  The Company recognizes changes in the fair value of the Swap and changes in the fair value of the Notes since inception of the Swap in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Through September 1, 2005, the cumulative difference between the change in the fair value of the Swap and the change in the fair value of the Notes was de minimis.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had pledged $34.5 million as collateral for the Swap which is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The amount of collateral fluctuates based on the fair value of the Swap.  The Swap will terminate if the closing price of the Company's common stock is at or exceeds $14.15 after February 6, 2006.
 
Call Spread Options: 
Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the "Call Spread Options") covering 53.7 million shares of the Company's common stock, which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in full.  The Call Spread Options have a lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled at the Company's option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29, 2008.  Settlement of the Call Spread Options in cash on January 29, 2008, the expiration date, would result in the Company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company's common stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market price per share of the Company's common stock is at or above $18.19.  Settlement of the Call Spread Options in net shares on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving a number of shares of the Company's common stock, not to exceed 18.9 million shares, with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash settlement.  Should there be an early unwind of the Call Spread Options, the amount of cash or net shares potentially received by the Company will be dependent upon then existing overall market conditions, and on the Company's stock price, the volatility of the Company's stock and the amount of time remaining on the Call Spread Options.  The Call Spread Options therefore have the potential of limiting the dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes from 53.7 million shares to as few as 34.8 million shares.  The Call Spread Option transactions, including fees and costs of $109.1 million, are accounted for as capital transactions.
 
Commitments
 
As of September 1, 2005, the Company had commitments of approximately $250 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.  The Company leases certain facilities, equipment and software under operating leases.  Total rental expense on all operating leases was $23.4 million, $21.1 million and $24.6 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases aggregated $60.8 million as of September 1, 2005, and are payable as follows:  $18.1 million in 2006; $8.3 million in 2007; $5.7 million in 2008; $3.0 million in 2009; $2.5 million in 2010, $23.2 million in 2011 and thereafter.
 
Contingencies
 
As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Company's products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights.  In this regard, the Company is engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. ("Rambus") relating to certain of Rambus' patents and certain of the Company's claims and defenses.  Lawsuits between Rambus and the Company are pending in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.  The Company also is engaged in litigation with Tessera, Inc. ("Tessera") relating to certain of Tessera's patents and certain of the Company's patents in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  Among other things, the above lawsuits pertain to certain of the Company's SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, and DDR2 SDRAM products, which account for a significant portion of net sales.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against the Company.  A court determination that the Company's products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require the Company to make material changes to its products and/or manufacturing processes.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
On June 17, 2002, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking information regarding an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") into possible antitrust violations in the "Dynamic Random Access Memory" or "DRAM" industry.  The Company is cooperating fully and actively with the DOJ in its investigation.  The Company's cooperation is pursuant to the terms of the DOJ's Corporate Leniency Policy, which provides that in exchange for the Company's full, continuing and complete
cooperation in the pending investigation, the Company will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other penalties from the DOJ.  Subsequent to the commencement of the DOJ investigation, at least eighty-three (four of which have been voluntarily dismissed) purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and other DRAM suppliers in various federal and state courts in the United States and in Puerto Rico by direct and indirect purchasers alleging price-fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws, violations of state unfair competition law, and/or unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products.  The complaints seek treble damages for the alleged damages sustained by purported class members, in addition to restitution, costs and attorneys' fees, as well as an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct.  Three purported class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada, alleging violations of the Canadian Competition Act.  The substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the United States and Puerto Rico.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits.  Based upon the Company's analysis of the claims made and the nature of the DRAM industry, the Company believes that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs in the direct purchaser cases would be more appropriately resolved on a customer-by-customer basis.  In addition, the Attorneys General of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have indicated that they are investigating potential state and federal civil claims against the Company and other DRAM suppliers on behalf of state and governmental entities that were direct or indirect purchasers of DRAM and potentially on behalf of other indirect purchasers of DRAM.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and investigations.  The final resolution of these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
On May 5, 2004, Rambus filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California (San Francisco County) against the Company and other DRAM suppliers.  The complaint alleges various causes of action under California state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on Rambus DRAM ("RDRAM") and unfair competition.  Tessera also has asserted certain antitrust and unfair competition claims relating to Tessera's packaging technology.  These complaints seek treble damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaints.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these suits.  A court determination against the Company could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
The Company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of various asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date.  The Company is currently a party to other legal actions arising out of the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party.  It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company's obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
Redeemable Common Stock
 
connection with the Company's acquisition on April 22, 2002, of substantially all of the assets of Toshiba Corporation's ("Toshiba") DRAM business as conducted by Dominion Semiconductor L.L.C., the Company issued Toshiba 1.5 million shares of common stock and granted Toshiba an option to require the Company to repurchase the shares for $67.5 million in cash.  During the first quarter of 2004, Toshiba exercised its option and the Company redeemed the 1.5 million shares.

Stock Rights:
  On September 24, 2003, the Company received $450.0 million, which is included in additional capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, from Intel Corporation ("Intel") in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company's common stock.  In conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives through May 2005, including certain levels of DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing capacity, or be subject to monetary penalties.  The Company has achieved the DDR2 production and 300mm wafer processing milestones and, consequently, does not expect to make any payments to Intel under this agreement.  The shares issuable pursuant to the stock rights are included in weighted average common shares outstanding in the computations of earnings per share.

The following table summarizes information about options outstanding as of September 1, 2005:
 
  As of September 1, 2005, there were 305,000 shares of restricted stock awards outstanding.  The fair value for the restricted shares, all of which were granted during 2005, was $12.17 at grant date.  The restrictions lapse in one-third increments during each year of employment after the grant date.
Restricted Stock Awards:
 
Stock Purchase Plan:
  The Company's 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions.  Prior to July 1, 2005, shares could be purchased at 85% of the lower of the beginning or ending closing stock prices of each quarterly offering period.  After July 1, 2005, shares can be purchased at 95% of the ending closing stock price of each offering quarterly period.  Shares can be resold when purchased.  Purchases are limited to 20% of an employee's eligible compensation.  As of September 1, 2005, 26.3 million shares of the Company's common stock had been issued under the ESPP and 3.2 million shares were available for future issuance under the plan.
 
Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan:
  As of September 1, 2005, 39,957 shares of the Company's common stock had been issued under the 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan ("DSIP Plan") and 460,043 shares were reserved for future issuance under the plan.  Shares are issued under the DSIP plan as compensation to non-employee directors of the Company.
 
Stock-Based Compensation:
  Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the value of the Company's options included in pro forma amounts are presented below:
 
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and estimated option life.  For purposes of this valuation model, no dividends have been assumed.
Employee Savings Plan
 
The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan ("RAM Plan") under which U.S. employees may contribute up to 45% of their eligible pay (subject to IRS annual contribution limits) to various savings alternatives, none of which include direct investment in the Company's common stock.  Under the plan, the Company matches in cash eligible contributions from employees up to 3% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, or $1,500, whichever is greater.  The Company may provide additional contributions based on its financial performance.  Contribution expense for the Company's RAM Plan was $17.6 million, $13.7 million and $12.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Restructure and Other Charges
 
In 2003, the Company announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives.  The restructure plan included the shutdown of the Company's 200mm production line in Virginia; the discontinuance of certain memory products, including SRAM and TCAM; and an approximate 10% reduction in the Company's worldwide workforce.  In 2003, the Company recorded restructure charges of $109.2 million and other restructure-related charges of $7.1 million, including $50.7 million of equipment write-downs, $26.3 million of severance and other termination benefits and $18.6 million of intangible asset write downs.  Substantially all of the restructure charges were in the Memory segment.  The Company recorded net credits to restructure of $1.4 million and $22.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily from sales of equipment associated with the Company's 200mm production line in Virginia.  The Company substantially completed the restructure plan and paid essentially all costs associated with the restructure plan in 2004 and 2003.
 
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
 
Other operating income for 2005 includes net gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $12.7 million and $12.0 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs.  Other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of $17.2 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating income for 2004 includes $7.2 million from the Commonwealth of Virginia for meeting investment commitments at the Virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of $3.9 million on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment.  Other operating expense for 2003 includes net losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million and losses of $10.7 million from changes in currency exchange rates.  Other operating expense for 2003 is net of $14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs.
Income Taxes
 
Income (loss) before taxes and the income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:
 
 
A reconciliation between income tax (provision) computed using the U.S. federal statutory rate and the Company's income tax (provision) is as follows:
 
 
State taxes reflect investment tax credits of $13.7 million, $9.1 million and $16.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes.  The Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of the end of the periods shown below:
 
The Company currently records a valuation allowance against substantially all of its U.S. net deferred tax assets.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.5 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $140.7 million.  The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion and unused state tax credits of $137.5 million.  Substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2025.
 
The changes in valuation allowance of $24.6 million and $11.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, are primarily due to uncertainties of realizing certain U.S. net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards.  The change in the valuation allowance in 2005 and 2004 includes $1.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for stock plan deductions, which will be credited to additional capital if realized.
 
Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in additional tax liability.  Remaining undistributed earnings of $657.2 million have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
 
 
 Stock Rights" note.)
On September 24, 2003, the Company issued stock rights to Intel which are exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company's common stock.  The shares issuable pursuant to the stock rights are considered outstanding common shares in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share.  (See "Shareholders' Equity
 
Listed below are the potential common shares, as of the end of the periods shown below, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been antidilutive:
 
 
Joint Venture
 
Since 1998, the Company has participated in TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. ("TECH"), a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture in Singapore among the Company, the Singapore Economic Development Board, Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had a 39.12% ownership interest in TECH.  Significant financing, investment and operating decisions for TECH typically require approval from TECH's Board of Directors.  The shareholders' agreement for the TECH joint venture expires in 2011.  Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," TECH does not qualify for consolidation.
 
TECH's semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the Company's product and process technology.  Subject to specific terms and conditions, the Company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by TECH.  The Company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the preceding quarter.  The Company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by TECH.  The Company also provides certain technology, engineering and training to support TECH.  All of these transactions with TECH are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from TECH.  The net cost of products purchased from TECH amounted to $651.9 million, $453.8 million and $318.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Amortization expense resulting from the TECH supply arrangement, included in the cost of products purchased from TECH, was $11.7 million, $11.8 million and $9.6 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Receivables from TECH were $24.0 million and payables to TECH were $51.4 million as of September 1, 2005.  Receivables from TECH were $23.8 million and payables to TECH were $56.8 million as of September 2, 2004.  TECH supplied approximately 25% of
the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2005.  As of September 1, 2005, the Company had intangible assets with a net book value of $50.3 million relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from TECH.

Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Micron Technology, Inc.
 
We have completed an integrated audit of Micron Technology, Inc.'s 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
 
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 1, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 1, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 8 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Internal control over financial reporting
 
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (not presented herein) appearing under Item 9A Controls and Procedures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 1, 2005 that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the COSO.  The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
