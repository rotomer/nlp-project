EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BOISE, Idaho, December 21, 2006  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results for its first quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended November 30. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company earned net income of $192 million ($0.25 per diluted share based on 786 million shares) on net sales of $1.58 billion. These quarterly results compare to net income of $64 million ($0.08 per diluted share based on 759 million shares) on net sales of $1.37 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
The Company's revenue for Memory (DRAM and NAND) and Imaging products in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 grew approximately 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. The Company's average selling price for DRAM products increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of price increases for DDR and DDR2 DRAM products. The Company's overall gross margin for the quarter grew to 31 percent compared to 24 percent in the preceding quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company realized improvements in gross margins for Core DRAM, Specialty DRAM and NAND Flash memory products and maintained gross margins on sales of CMOS Image sensors. Sales of NAND Flash and CMOS Image sensor products in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 each represented approximately 15 percent of the Company's total sales.
The Company achieved several operational highlights in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  At the Company's 300mm Virginia facility, the transition of the Company's DRAM production to 78nm process technology and NAND production to 72nm process technology continued ahead of schedule. With significant tool installations in the first quarter, the Company's 300mm Utah facility remains on schedule for NAND Flash production in 2007. TECH Semiconductor, the Company's Singapore joint venture, also initiated its conversion to 300mm DRAM wafer production on 78nm process technology.
Mark Durcan, the Company's Chief Operating Officer commented, "We are pleased with the progress of our NAND operations and the ramp of DRAM production at TECH Singapore and at our Virginia fab."
The Company expects consolidated capital expenditures to approximate $4 billion in fiscal 2007, of which approximately $1.5 billion is expected to be funded by capital contributions from joint venture partners. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of $1.3 billion were primarily invested in expanding the Company's wafer fabrication operations in Virginia and Utah and in converting TECH Singapore to 300mm wafer processing. At the end of the first quarter, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $2.64 billion.
The Company will host a conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MST to discuss its financial results. The call, audio and slides will be available online at www.micron.com.

Income taxes for 2007 and 2006 primarily reflect taxes on the Company's non-U.S. operations and U.S. alternative minimum tax.  The Company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its U.S. operations.  The provision for taxes on U.S. operations in 2007 and 2006 was substantially offset by reductions in the valuation allowance.  As of November 30, 2006, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.5 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $169 million.  The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion and unused state tax credits of $167 million.  Substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2026.
