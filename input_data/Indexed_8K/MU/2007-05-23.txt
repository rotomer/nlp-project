Item 1.01.
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 17, 2007, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Micron"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representative of the underwriters (collectively, the "Underwriters") to issue and sell $1.135 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2014 (the "Notes") in a public offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") and a related prospectus (the "Prospectus") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Micron granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $165 million aggregate principal amount of Notes solely to cover over-allotments. On May 18, 2007, the Underwriters exercised this option in full. Micron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the Underwriters' option to purchase the additional Notes, will be approximately $1.27 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On May 23, 2007, Micron entered into an indenture (the "Indenture") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, relating to the Notes. The Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.875% per year on the principal amount, accruing from May 23, 2007. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2007. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2014, subject to earlier repurchase or conversion.
The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 70.2679 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $14.23 per share of common stock. Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after August 30, 2007 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing price of Micron's common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price per share of the Notes, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (2) if the Notes have been called for redemption; (3) if specified distributions to holders of Micron's common stock are made, or specified corporate events occur; (4) during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of Micron's common stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; or (5) at any time on or after March 1, 2014.
 scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the Notes, Micron may irrevocably elect to deliver cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and shares of common stock, cash or a combination thereof in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted.
Upon conversion, Micron will have the right to deliver, in lieu of shares of its common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. At any time on or prior to the 30
th
If a holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control, as defined in the Indenture, Micron will, in certain circumstances, pay a make-whole premium by increasing the conversion rate for the Notes converted in connection with such make-whole change in control. Micron may not redeem the Notes prior to June 6, 2011. Upon a change in control or a termination of trading, as defined in the Indenture, the holders may require Micron to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The Notes are Micron's general, unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of Micron's existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the assets securing such debt, and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Micron's subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Indenture does not limit the amount of indebtedness that Micron or any of its subsidiaries may incur.
2
The following events are considered "Events of Default," which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes:
Micron's failure to pay when due the principal on any of the Notes at maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
                 
Micron's failure to pay interest on any of the Notes for 30 days after the date when due;
                 
Micron's failure to give timely notice of a termination of trading, a change of control or a make-whole change in control that does not constitute a change in control, which continues for a period of three business days;
                 
Micron's failure to give timely notice of a distribution to its stockholders, which continues for a period of three business days;
                 
Micron's failure to comply with its obligation to convert the Notes into common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock, upon exercise of a holder's conversion right;
                 
Micron's failure to perform or observe any other covenants or agreement under the Indenture governing the Notes and Micron fails to cure or obtain a waiver of such default for a period of 60 days after receiving notice of such failure;
                 
A default by Micron under any indebtedness that results in acceleration of such indebtedness, or the failure to pay any such indebtedness at maturity, in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $100 million, and such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled within 30 days;
                 
Certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company or any significant subsidiary.
                 
In connection with the offering of the notes, the Company also entered into capped call transactions with the following entities affiliated with the Underwriters: one capped call transaction with Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (the "Morgan Stanley Capped Call") and two capped call transactions with Credit Suisse International (the "First Credit Suisse Capped Call" and the "Second Credit Suisse Capped Call" and collectively with the Morgan Stanley Capped Call and the First Credit Suisse Capped Call, the "Capped Calls"). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of $14.2312 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the Notes.  The Morgan Stanley Capped Call has a cap price of $17.25000 per share; the First Credit Suisse Capped Call has a cap price of $20.1250 per share; and the Second Credit Suisse Capped Call has a cap price of $23.0000 per share. The Capped Calls are in three equal tranches and cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments similar to those contained in the notes, an approximate combined total of 91.3 million shares of common stock (after adjustment for the Underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement). The Capped Calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. If, however, the market value per share of the common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, exceeds the applicable cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price. Micron paid approximately $151.1 million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. The Morgan Stanley Capped Call expires in four and one-half years, the First Credit Suisse Capped Call expires in five years, and the Second Credit Suisse Capped Call expires in five and one-half years. The Morgan Stanley Capped Call is filed as Exhibit 10.1, the First Credit Suisse Capped Call is filed as Exhibit 10.2 and the Second Credit Suisse Capped Call is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The summary of the foregoing transactions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Underwriting Agreement, Indenture and Capped Calls, which are included as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

Public Offering
4.          Payment for the Firm Securities shall be made to the Company in Federal or other funds immediately available to the account specified by the Company to the Representative on the closing date and time set forth in Schedule I hereto, or at such other time on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Representative and the Company.  The time and date of such payment are hereinafter referred to as the "."
Payment and Delivery. 
Closing Date
Payment for any Additional Securities shall be made to the Company in Federal or other funds immediately available to the account specified by the Company to the Representative on the date specified in the corresponding notice described in Section 2 or at such other time on the same or on such other date, in any event not later than the tenth business day thereafter, as may be designated in writing by the Representative.

5.          .  The several obligations of the Underwriters are subject to the following conditions:
Conditions to the Underwriters' Obligations
(a)           Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or the applicable Option Closing Date:
(i)        there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; and
(ii)       there shall not have occurred any material change, or any development involving a prospective Material Adverse Effect, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus as of the date of this Agreement that, in your judgment, is so material and adverse and that makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus.
(b)           The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date and each Option Closing Date, if any, a certificate, dated the Closing Date or applicable Option Closing Date, as the case may be, and signed by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company, to the effect set forth in Section 5(a)(i) above and to the effect that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are (i) true and correct in all material respects (other than representations and warranties qualified by materiality, in which case such representations shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on such delivery date or applicable Option Closing Date, as the case may be, (ii) that the Company has complied in all material respects with all of the agreements and satisfied all of the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder on or before the Closing Date or applicable Option Closing Date, as applicable, and (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Time of Sale Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus.
9
The officer signing and delivering such certificate may rely upon the best of his or her knowledge as to proceedings threatened.

(i)            Prior to the Closing Date the Company shall have received all waivers or consents under any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, stockholder agreement or other agreement that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that are necessary for the issuance of the Securities and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.
The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Additional Securities hereunder are subject to the delivery to you on the applicable Option Closing Date of such documents as you may reasonably request with respect to the good standing of the Company, the due authorization and issuance of the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date and other matters related to the issuance of such Additional Securities.
6.          .  The Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows:
Covenants of the Company

(b)           Before amending or supplementing the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, to furnish to you a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement and not to file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object, except as may be required by applicable law, and to file with the Commission within the applicable period specified in Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act any prospectus required to be filed pursuant to such Rule.
11
(c)           To furnish to you a copy of each proposed free writing prospectus to be prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company and not to use or refer to any proposed free writing prospectus to which the Representative reasonably object.
(d)           Not to take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriter that the Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
(e)           If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist, as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(f)            If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities and prior to the completion of the distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the
12
Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(g)           To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Representative shall reasonably request in writing prior to the Closing Date, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is otherwise not so subject.
(h)           To make generally available to the Company's security holders and to you as soon as practicable an earning statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the date of this Agreement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(i)            Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, to pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and the Company's accountants in connection with the registration and delivery of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including the filing fees payable to the Commission relating to the Securities (within the time required by Rule 456 (b)(1), if applicable), all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers, in the quantities hereinabove specified, (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities under state securities laws and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(f) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum, (iii) all filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with the review and
13
qualification of the offering of the Securities by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (iv) the cost of printing certificates representing the Securities, (v) the costs and charges of any transfer agent, registrar or depositary, (vi) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Securities, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the preparation or dissemination of any electronic roadshow, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and any such consultants, and the cost of any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show, (vii) the document production charges and expenses associated with printing this Agreement and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section.

Incorporated.
(k)           To prepare a final term sheet relating to the offering of the Securities, containing only information that describes the final terms of the offering in a form consented to by the Managers, and to file such final term sheet within the period required by Rule 433(d)(5)(ii) under the Securities Act following the date the final terms have been established for the offering of the Securities.
(l)            To use commercially reasonable efforts to list the Underlying Securities issuable upon conversion of the Securities on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or another U.S. national securities exchange or established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States of America.

(n)           To reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, shares of Underlying Securities for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligation to issue shares of its Underlying Securities upon conversion of the Securities.
The Company also covenants with each Underwriter that, without the prior written consent of the Representative, it will not, during the restricted period set forth in Schedule I hereto, (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise or (3) file any registration statement with the Commission relating to the offering of any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.  The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) the Securities to be sold hereunder, (b) the issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an option or warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding on the date hereof of which the Underwriters have been advised in writing, (c) any grants under the Company's equity or stock plans in accordance with the terms of such plans as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus, (d) issuances of Shares or rights to receive Shares in connection with an acquisition or a strategic or minority investment transaction by a customer, supplier or other business partner (or a person that becomes a business partner in connection with such a transaction), provided that the aggregate market value of the Shares issued in, or issuable upon the exercise of rights to receive Shares granted in, such transactions in the aggregate shall not exceed $50,000,000 (fifty million U.S. dollars) (based on the closing price of the Shares as of the date of the transaction, as reported on the Exchange), or (e) the capped-call transactions described in the Time of Sale Prospectus.
7.          .  Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise
Covenants of the Underwriters
15
would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
8.            (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, (and other than with respect to the Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution.
(b)           Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers who sign the Registration Statement, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c)           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
16
indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or
17
(ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e)           The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
18
(f)            The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents, or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
9.          .  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representative to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York or Idaho State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Representative's judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause 9, makes it, in the Representative's judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
Termination
10.        .  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representative may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to
19
purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
11.        .  (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the
Entire Agreement
20
Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
(b)           The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
12.        .  This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
13.        .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
Applicable Law

The Conversion Trigger Price will initially equal $18.50 and shall be automatically adjusted whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as a result of an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Article 10.  The Company will determine at the beginning of each calendar quarter commencing at any time after August 30, 2007 (through the calendar quarter ending February 28, 2014), whether the Notes are convertible as a result of the price of Common Stock exceeding the Conversion Trigger Price in accordance with Section 10.01(b)(i) and will notify the Company, the Conversion Agent and the Trustee.

If the Company does not, when it is obligated to, make a request to the Trustee to determine the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, or if the Company makes such request to the Trustee, but the Trustee does not or cannot make such determination, then the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be deemed to be less than 98% of the product of the Closing Price of
38
Common Stock and the then applicable Conversion Rate.  If the Trading Price Condition has been met, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders.  If, at any point after the Trading Price Condition has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than 98% of the product of the Closing Price of Common Stock and the then Applicable Conversion Rate, the Company shall so notify Noteholders.
(e)           Upon the first public announcement of any distribution described in Section 10.01(b)(iii) or Section 10.01(b)(iv), the Company shall notify the Noteholders at least 35 Business Days prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution by (i) issuing a press release and using its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (ii) providing written notice to Noteholders by mailing such notice to Noteholders at their address in the Register (in the case of a Certificated Note), or through the facilities of the Depositary (in the case of a Global Note).
Following the announcement of any public announcement of a transaction described in Section 10.01(b)(v) or Section 10.01(b)(vi), the Company shall notify the Noteholders and the Trustee as promptly as practicable, but at least 35 Business Days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction in the case of a Change in Control or a Make-Whole Change in Control, and the earlier of the day immediately following the date the applicable securities exchange announces that a termination of trading will occur or on the effective date of a Termination of Trading in the case of a Termination of Trading by (i) issuing a press release and using its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (ii) providing written notice to Noteholders by mailing such notice to Noteholders at their address in the Register (in the case of a Certificated Note), or through the facilities of the Depositary (in the case of a Global Note).

(g)           Noteholders shall not have the right to convert their Notes pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) or Section 10.01(b)(iv) if in connection with the distribution described in Section 10.01(b)(iii) or Section 10.01(b)(iv) that gives rise to a right to convert their Notes, such Noteholders are entitled to participate (as a result of holding their Notes, and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in the distribution described in such Section as if such Noteholders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Rate on the Ex-Date for such distribution, the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Noteholder, without having to convert their Notes.

If a Noteholder holds a beneficial interest in a Global Note, to convert such beneficial interest, such Noteholder must comply with the requirements (4) and (5) as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and comply with the applicable procedures of the Depositary for converting a beneficial interest in a Global Note.  The first date on which all of the requirements set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.02(a) (in the case of a Certificated Note) or the second sentence of this Section 10.02(a) (in the case of a Global Note or a beneficial interest therein) have been satisfied is referred to in this Indenture as the "."  The Conversion Agent shall, within one (1) Business Day of any Conversion Date, provide notice to the Company, as set forth in Section 12.03, of the occurrence of such Conversion Date.
Conversion Date
(b)           The Company may satisfy the Conversion Obligation by delivering shares of Common Stock, Cash, or a combination thereof as set forth in this Section 10.02(b).  The Company shall inform Noteholders through the Trustee of the method the Company chooses to satisfy the Conversion Obligation (and the Specified Cash Amount, if applicable, as described in the immediately succeeding paragraph) no later than the 25th Scheduled Trading Day prior to the Maturity Date (in respect of Notes converted during the period on or after the 24th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date) and no later than two Trading Days following the applicable Conversion Date (in all other cases), as the case may be.  Except to the extent the Company has irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement as described in Section 10.02(c), if the Company does not give notice within the time periods described in the immediately preceding sentence as to how it intends to settle any Conversion Obligation, the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation by delivering solely shares of Common Stock (except for any Cash in lieu of fractional shares).
If the Company chooses to satisfy any portion of the Conversion Obligation in Cash (except for any Cash in lieu of fractional shares), or if the Company has irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement as described in Section 10.02(c), the Company shall notify holders during the periods set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of the amount to be satisfied in Cash as a fixed dollar amount per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the ""); that if the Company has previously irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement as described in Section 10.02(c), the Specified Cash Amount must be at least equal to $1,000.  If, subsequent to the Company electing Net Share Settlement, the Company fails to timely notify converting Noteholders of the Specified Cash Amount, the Specified Cash Amount shall be deemed to be $1,000.
Specified Cash Amount
provided
The Company shall treat all Holders with the same Cash Settlement Averaging Period in the same manner.  The Company shall not, however, have any obligation to settle any Conversion Obligations arising with respect to different Cash Settlement Averaging Periods in the same manner.
If the Company elects to settle any conversion of Notes by delivering solely shares of Common Stock, such settlement shall occur as soon as practicable after the Company notifies
40
Holders that is has chosen such method of settlement, but in any event within three Business Days of the relevant Conversion Date.  Any settlement of a Conversion Obligation made entirely or partially in Cash (other than Cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall occur on the third Business Day immediately following the final Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
The amount of Cash and/or number of shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, due upon conversion of Notes shall be determined as follows:
(1)           If the Company elects to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation by delivering Common Stock, the Company shall deliver to the converting Holder a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) (A) the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted (B) 1,000 (ii) the Applicable Conversion Rate in effect on the relevant Conversion Date ( that the Company shall deliver Cash in lieu of fractional shares as described in Section 10.03).

provided
(2)           If the Company elects to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation by paying Cash, the Company shall pay to the converting Holder, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted, Cash in an amount equal to the Conversion Value.
(3)           If the Company elects to satisfy the Conversion Obligation by delivering or paying, as the case may be, a combination of Cash and Common Stock, or if the Company has irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement pursuant to Section 10.02(c), the Company shall deliver to the converting holder, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted (x) Cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Specified Cash Amount (which shall be at least $1,000 if the Company has made an irrevocable Net Share Settlement Election) and (B) the Conversion Value; and (y) if the Conversion Value is greater than the Specified Cash Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the sum of the Daily Share Amounts for each of the twenty Trading Days in the Cash Settlement Averaging Period ( that the Company shall deliver Cash in lieu of fractional shares as described in Section 10.03).
provided
(c)   At any time on or prior to the 30th Scheduled Trading Day prior to the Maturity Date, the Company may irrevocably elect to satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to any Notes converted after the date of such election by delivering Cash up to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted, and shares of Common Stock, Cash or a combination thereof in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Conversion Obligation.  Such election (a "" election) shall be in the Company's sole discretion and shall not require the consent of Noteholders.  Upon making a Net Share Settlement election, the Company shall promptly (i) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (ii) provide written notice to Noteholders by mailing such notice to Noteholders at their address in the Register (in the case of a Certificated Note), or through the facilities of the Depositary (in the case of a Global Note).
Net Share Settlement
(d)   A Holder receiving Common Stock upon conversion shall not be entitled to any rights as a holder of Common Stock, including, among other things, the right to vote and receive dividends and notices of stockholder meetings, until the Close of Business on the Conversion Date
41
(if the Company delivers solely Common Stock in respect of the Conversion Obligation pursuant to clause (1) of Section 10.02(b), other than Cash in lieu of fractional shares delivered pursuant to Section 10.03) or the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period (if the Company delivers cash in respect of any portion of the Conversion Obligation pursuant to clause (2) or clause (3) of Section 10.02(b), other than Cash in lieu of any fractional shares delivered pursuant to Section 10.03, or if the Company has irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement).
(e)   No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on, or other distributions with respect to, any Common Stock except as provided in this Article 10.  Upon conversion of a Note, a Noteholder will not receive, except as described below, any Cash payment representing accrued interest.  Instead, accrued interest will be deemed paid by the Cash and/or shares of Common Stock, if any, received by the Noteholder upon conversion.  Delivery to the Noteholder of such Cash and/or shares of Common Stock shall thus be deemed to satisfy (1) the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of a Note, and (2) the Company's obligation to pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the Note.  As a result, upon conversion of a Note, accrued and unpaid interest on such Note is deemed paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.
(f)    Notwithstanding Section 10.02(e), if Notes are converted after a Record Date but prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, Holders of such notes at the Close of Business on such Record Date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion.  Such Notes, upon surrender for conversion, must be accompanied by Cash equal to the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the Notes so converted; that no such payment need be made (1) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Record Date but on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Repurchase Date that is after a Record Date but on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, (3) with respect to any notes converted after the Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date or (4) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest that exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.
provided
(g)   If a Noteholder converts more than one Note at the same time, the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount of Cash, if any, including Cash in lieu of fractional shares, due upon conversion shall be determined based on the total principal amount of the Notes converted.
(h)   Upon surrender of a Note that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Note surrendered.
Section 10.03.        .  The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of a Note.  Instead, the Company shall pay Cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Closing Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day prior to the applicable Conversion Date (if the Company delivers solely shares of Common Stock to satisfy the Conversion Obligation, other than such Cash in lieu of fractional shares) or the Closing Price of Common Stock on the last Trading Day of the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period (if the Company delivers Cash to satisfy a portion, but less than all, of the Conversion Obligation, other than solely such Cash in lieu
Fractional Shares
42
of any fractional shares, or if the Company has irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement upon conversion).
Section 10.04.        .  If a Holder converts a Note, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion.  However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name.  The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because Common Stock is to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name.
Taxes on Conversion
Section 10.05.        .  The Company shall, from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the delivery in respect of all outstanding Notes of the number of shares of Common Stock due upon conversion (assuming, for purposes of this sentence, that the Company elects to deliver solely shares of Common Stock in respect of the Conversion Obligation).
Company to Provide Common Stock
Any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
The Company will comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes, if any, and shall list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
In addition, if any shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares of Common Stock may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will cause such shares of Common Stock to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be.
Section 10.06.        .  (a) If the Company shall, at any time and from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, issue dividends or make distributions on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution by a fraction:
Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock
(i)    the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or distribution; and
plus
43
(ii)   the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Date.
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.06 is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.06.
(b)   If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, subdivide or reclassify outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, if the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, combine or reclassify outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased.  In each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision, combination or reclassification and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision, combination or reclassification.  Such increase or reduction (solely in the case of any combination or reclassification of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock), as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision, combination or reclassification becomes effective.
Section 10.07.        .  If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights, options or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution at less than the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of such distribution, then the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution by a fraction:
Adjustment for Rights, Options or Warrants Issue
(x)            the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for purchase; and
plus
(y)           the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered would purchase at the Current Market Price
plus
44
of Common Stock on the first public announcement date for such distribution (determined by multiplying such total number of shares of Common Stock so offered by the exercise price of such rights, options or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such Current Market Price).
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution.
To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred.  In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the relevant distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, options or warrants and the value of such consideration if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.  In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07.
If the Company elects to make a distribution described in this Section 10.07 that has a per share of Common Stock value equal to more than 15% of the Closing Price of Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company will be required to give notice to Holders at least 35 Business Days prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.
Section 10.08.        .
Adjustment for Other Distributions
(a)      If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distribute to all holders of Common Stock any of its Capital Stock, assets (including shares of any Subsidiary of the Company or business unit of the Company), or debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company (excluding (x) any dividends or distributions described in Section 10.06, (y) any rights, options or warrants described in Section 10.07 and (z) any dividends or other distributions described in Section 10.09 (such Capital Stock, assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company hereinafter in this Section 10.08 called the "")), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution by a fraction:
Distributed Assets
(i)    the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of Common Stock, and
(ii)   the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution,
minus
45
the fair market value, as determined by the Board of Directors, of the portion of Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock;
Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution; that if "the fair market value, as determined by the Board of Directors, of the portion of Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall receive on the date on which the Distributed Assets are distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, the amount of Distributed Assets such Noteholder would have received had such Noteholder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such distribution.  In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.  In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.08(a).
provided
If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.08(a) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "") used in computing the Current Market Price for purposes of clause (i) above, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the fair market value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holders.
Reference Period
(b)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.08, if the Company distributes Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary of the Company or other business unit of the Company (a ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the fifteenth Trading Day immediately following the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off by a fraction:
Spin-Off
(x)     the numerator of which will be the sum of (A) the average of the Closing Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off and (B) the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off; and
(y)     the denominator of which is the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.08(b).
46
(c)   If the Company elects to make a distribution described in Section 10.08(a) or Section 10.08(b) that has a per share of Common Stock value equal to more than 15% of the Closing Price of Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company will be required to give notice to Holders at least 35 Business Days prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.
Section 10.09.        .  If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, distribute dividends or make other distributions paid entirely in Cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (other than (x) distributions described in Section 10.10 below or (y) any dividend or distribution in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution by a fraction:
Adjustment for Cash Dividends
(x)    the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of Common Stock; and
(y)   the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, the amount per share of such dividend or distribution.
minus
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution or dividend; that if "the amount per share of such dividend or distribution" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive on the date on which the relevant Cash dividend or distribution is distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Cash such Noteholder would have received had such Noteholder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.  In the event that such distribution or dividend is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.09.
If the Company elects to make a distribution described in this Section 10.09 that has a per share of Common Stock value equal to more than 15% of the Closing Price of Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company will be required to give notice to Holders at least 35 Business Days prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.
Section 10.10.        .  If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at any time or from time to time, while any of the Notes are outstanding, distribute Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, where such Cash and the value of any such other consideration per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged

(y)   the denominator of which will be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, including the Purchased Shares, and the Closing Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.10 shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.  In the event that the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.  If the application of this Section 10.10 to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 10.10.
Section 10.11.        .  Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under Section 10.08, and, if applicable, Section 10.23.  If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date

of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof), except as set forth in Section 10.23.  In addition, except as set forth in Section 10.23, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 was made (including any adjustment contemplated in Section 10.23), (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Section 10.12.        .  If any of the following events (a "") occurs:
Disposition Events
Disposition Event
(a)   any reclassification of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination);
(b)   consolidation, merger, or other combination involving the Company; or
(c)   sale or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;
in each case, in which holders of outstanding Common Stock would be entitled to receive Cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock, if a Holder converts its Notes on or after the effective date of any such event, subject to the right of the Company to settle all or a portion of the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes in Cash (other than solely Cash in lieu of any fractional shares), and the right of the Company to irrevocably elect Net Share Settlement, Notes will be convertible into, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable, the same type (in the same proportions) of consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the relevant event (collectively, "").
Reference Property
If the Company elects to settle all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation in Cash (other than solely Cash in lieu of any fractional shares) or if the Company irrevocably elects Net Share Settlement, Holders shall receive in connection with any conversion (1) Cash in an amount equal to the portion of the Conversion Obligation that Company has elected to settle with Cash (which shall be at least equal to the lesser of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted and
49
(y) the relevant Conversion Value, if the Company has irrevocably elected Net Share Settlement); and (2) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable, if any, Reference Property.  If the Company elects to settle any conversion in whole or in part by delivering Cash in respect the Conversion Obligation (other than solely Cash in lieu of any fractional shares) or if the Company irrevocably elects Net Share Settlement, the amount of Cash and any Reference Property that the Holders will receive will be based on the Daily Share Amounts of Reference Property and the Applicable Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.02.
If the Disposition Event provides the holders of Common Stock with the right to receive more than a single type of consideration determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, the Reference Property shall be comprised of the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock upon the occurrence of such event.
Upon the occurrence of a Disposition Event, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.02(b) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture.  Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 10.  If, in the case of any Disposition Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a Person other than the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article 3 herein.
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 10.12, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Disposition Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.  The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at its address appearing on the Register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
Section 10.13.        .  (a) If, after the date hereof, a Change in Control (determined after giving effect to any exceptions or exclusions to such definition, but without regard to the in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, a "") occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Change in Control, the Company

will, under certain circumstances, increase the Applicable Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described in this Section 10.13.  A conversion of Notes will be deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" a Make-Whole Change in Control if the notice of conversion of the Notes is received by the Conversion Agent from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Change in Control up to, and including, the Business Day immediately prior to the related Repurchase Date (or, in the case of an event that would have been a Change in Control but for the in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the 35th Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Change in Control).  Upon surrender of Notes for conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Change in Control, the Company will have the right to deliver, in lieu of shares of Common Stock, including the Make-Whole Shares, Cash or a combination of Cash and shares of Common Stock as described in Section 10.02.
Make-Whole Shares
proviso
On or before the 15th day after the occurrence of a Make-Whole Change in Control that does not also constitute a Change in Control, the Company will mail to the Trustee and to all Holders at their addresses shown in the Register of the Registrar, and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law, notice indicating that a Make-Whole Change in Control has occurred.
(b)           The number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date which such Make-Whole Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price paid per share of Common Stock in the Make-Whole Change in Control (in the case of a Make-Whole Change in Control described in clause (ii) of the definition of Change in Control in which holders of Common Stock receive only Cash), or in the case of any other Make-Whole Change in Control, the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Change in Control (the "").

(c)           The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Applicable Conversion Rate is adjusted.  The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment, and the denominator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  In addition, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Applicable Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.06 through Section 10.10.

(d)           If the exact Stock Price and Effective Date is not set forth in the table, then (i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Notes will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and/or the earlier and later Effective Dates in the table, as applicable, based on a 365-day year, (ii) if the Stock Price is in excess of $50.00 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.13(c)), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes; and (iii) if the Stock Price is less than $11.50 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.13(c)), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes.
(e)           The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and 10.10 as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
(f)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to holders of record of the Notes a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
Section 10.14.        .  No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate.  Any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate will be carried forward and taken into account in determining any subsequent adjustment.  In addition, the Company shall make any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected on each anniversary of the date hereof, upon conversion of any Note, upon required repurchases of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.01, and on each day from and after the 24th Scheduled Trading Day prior to the Maturity Date.
When Adjustment May Be Deferred
Section 10.15.        .  (a) No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 or 10.10 if Noteholders participate,

(c)           No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.
(d)           No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of Common Stock.
(e)           To the extent the Notes become convertible pursuant to this Article 10 into Cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the Cash.  Interest will not accrue on the Cash.
(f)            Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to the contrary, the Applicable Conversion Rate shall not exceed 86.9565 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, other than on account of adjustments to the Conversion Rate in the manner set forth in Sections 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and 10.10.
Section 10.16.        .  Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Noteholders a notice of the adjustment.  The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and a certificate from the Company's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it.  The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct.
