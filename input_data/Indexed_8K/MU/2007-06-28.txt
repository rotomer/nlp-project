EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced financial results for its third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2007, which ended May 31. For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the company posted a net loss of $225 million ($0.29 per diluted share) on net sales of $1.3 billion.
Boise, Idaho, June 28, 2007
 
The company achieved significant per megabit cost decreases for its NAND Flash and DRAM products in the third quarter of approximately 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively, as compared to the preceding quarter. The companys per megabit cost decreases were obtained primarily through transitions to higher density, advanced geometry devices and the ramp of NAND Flash products at the companys 300mm fabrication facilities. The companys net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was largely the result of severe price declines across most memory products. Recent growth in industry supply resulted in price declines in the third quarter of approximately 35 percent for DRAM and 30 percent for NAND Flash products as compared to the second quarter.
 
Gigabyte sales of NAND Flash memory products in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 increased by approximately 75 percent, as compared to the second quarter, to represent approximately 25 percent of the companys total Memory revenue. Sales of Imaging products in the third quarter remained at 11 percent of the companys total net sales reflecting industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure.
 
Leadership Appointment
 
Steve Appleton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, also announced today that Mark Durcan, Chief Operating Officer (COO), has been appointed President and COO. Durcan, 46, was appointed Microns COO in early 2006. Durcan joined Micron in 1984 as a diffusion engineer and has since held a variety of increasingly responsible positions involving technology process integration and development, including Chief Technical Officer and Vice President of Research and Development.
 
Marks contributions over the past 23 years have been tremendous, said Appleton. I look forward to his continued leadership in this role.
 
Company Initiatives
 
The company is pursuing a number of initiatives to drive greater cost efficiencies and revenue growth across its operations. These initiatives include developing production cost efficiencies closer in location to Microns global customers, evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the companys overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks. Micron is also exploring opportunities to leverage the companys industry-leading technology and diversified product portfolio to accelerate revenue growth and increase shareholder value. While some elements of these initiatives will be effected immediately, others will take multiple quarters to implement.
 
The company will host a conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MDT to discuss its financial results. The call, audio and slides will be available online at www.micron.com. A webcast replay will be available on the Companys Web site until June 28, 2008.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY, Continued
 
aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $199 million.  The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.5 billion and unused state tax credits of $170 million.  Substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2026.
In May 2007, the Company issued $1.3 billion of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2014 (the Notes).  The issuance costs associated with the Notes totaled $26 million.  Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of 70.2679 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes.  This conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $14.23 per share.  The Company may redeem the notes at any time after June 6, 2011, at par if the trading price of the Companys common stock is at least 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time.
Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased capped call options with various cap prices covering an aggregate of 91.3 million shares of the Companys common stock.  The capped call options have a lower strike price of $14.23, higher strike prices ranging from $17.25 to $23.00, may be settled at the Companys option either in cash or net shares and expire on various dates between November 2011 and December 2012.  The Capped Call Options have the potential of limiting the dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes from 91.3 million shares to as few as 65.4 million shares.  The Capped Call Option transactions, including fees and costs of $151 million, are accounted for as capital transactions.
