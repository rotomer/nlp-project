Effective December 6, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors accelerated the vesting of time-based restricted shares held by W.G. Stover, Jr., the Companys former Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Stover announced his intention to resign from the Company in July 2007 and terminated his employment with the Company on November 29, 2007.  Under the terms of Mr. Stovers severance agreement with the Company, certain compensation and benefits, including the lapsing of restrictions associated with restricted stock of the Company, are extended for approximately one year from Mr. Stovers resignation date.  As a result, pursuant to Mr. Stovers severance agreement restrictions as to 27,640 shares of restricted stock were scheduled to lapse within one year of his termination.  In connection with Mr. Stovers resignation and in recognition of his approximate 20 years of service with the Company, the Compensation Committee  accelerated the lapsing of restrictions as to these shares and an additional 18,427 shares currently held by Mr. Stover.  The form of Mr. Stovers severance agreement with the Company was included as an exhibit to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2007.  As a result of Mr. Stovers earlier announcement to resign, he did not enter into a new form of severance agreement, as did other Company officers, described in the Companys most recent proxy statement on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
