On December 20, 2007, Micron Technology, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 29, 2007.  The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The Company is pursuing a number of initiatives beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to drive greater cost efficiencies and revenue growth across its operations.  These initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas of the Company as the Companys business is realigned.  Additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to the Companys global customers, evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the Companys overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded restructure charges of $13 million and $19 million, respectively, consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction in the Companys workforce. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a charge to write down to their estimated fair values certain facilities expected to be sold.  The Company anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of fiscal 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives, but is currently unable to estimate the aggregate amount of the charges.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding future restructure charges. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents the Company files on a consolidated basis from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the Company's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results for the Company on a consolidated basis to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements (see Certain Factors). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform to actual results.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
, December 20, 2007  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results of operations for the companys first quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended November 29, 2007. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the company incurred a net loss of $262 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.5 billion. These results compare to a net loss of $158 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
BOISE, Idaho
 
The companys growth in revenue in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter was primarily driven by significant sales volume increases in memory products (for both DRAM and NAND Flash). Sales of CMOS image sensors products in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 also increased approximately 15 percent compared to the previous quarter as a result of a higher level of unit sales. Megabit sales volume for DRAM and NAND Flash memory products increased approximately 25 percent and 60 percent, respectively, comparing the first quarter to the previous quarter, primarily as a result of higher levels of production and strong demand. However, the companys first quarter results continued to be significantly affected by industry supply/demand dynamics. Average selling prices decreased approximately 20 percent for DRAM and 30 percent for NAND Flash memory products compared to the already low prices realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Primarily due to prevailing market conditions, the company recorded a $62 million write-down of its finished goods and work in process inventories for memory products to reduce their carrying values to their estimated market values. This write-down is included in the companys reported cost of goods sold for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
 
Despite the write-down, the company achieved a decrease in cost of goods sold per megabit in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately 10 percent and 15 percent for DRAM and NAND Flash memory products, respectively. Higher levels of production and lower manufacturing costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were a result of the companys acceleration of industry-leading process technology, transitions to higher density memory products and significant improvements and growth in the companys 300mm operations. The company continues to ramp production of 300mm NAND wafers at its IM Flash joint venture fab in Lehi, Utah and 300mm DRAM wafers at its TECH Semiconductor operation in Singapore.
 
The company ended the first quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and investments. The company had capital expenditures of approximately $885 million during the first quarter and received $150 million in cash contributions from Intel Corporation, a partner in the IM Flash joint ventures. The company estimates capital expenditures aggregating between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the 2008 fiscal year, of which approximately $500 million is estimated to be funded by contributions from joint venture partners.
 
The company will host a conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MST to discuss its financial results. The call, audio and slides will be available online at www.micron.com. A webcast replay will be available on the companys Web site until December 20, 2008.
