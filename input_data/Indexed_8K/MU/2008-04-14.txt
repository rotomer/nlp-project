EXHIBIT 10.50
This Severance Agreement (the Agreement) is by and between Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), and , an individual and Officer of the Company, (the Officer), and is effective as of
Ronald C. Foster
April 9, 2008.
WHEREAS, the parties recognize that it is in the best interest of the Company to provide for a smooth transition when there is a change in management, and wish to recognize the valued contributions of the Officer; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide the Officer with benefits in consideration for his or her execution of this Agreement and the instrument titled Agreement Not to Compete or Solicit (the Noncompete Agreement);
NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
1.TERMINATION OF THE OFFICER.  Either the Company or the Officer may at any time terminate the Officers active employment with the Company for any reason, voluntary or involuntary, with or without cause, by providing notice to that effect in writing.
   
2.LOSS OF OFFICER STATUS. Upon receipt by the Officer of a notice of termination from the Company, or at any other time upon the Companys request, the Officer shall resign immediately as an officer and/or director of the Company.
   
3.SEPARATION FROM SERVICE.  The date of the Officers Separation from Service shall be the earliest of: (i) the date of the Officers death; or (ii) the date after which the Company and the Officer reasonably anticipate that the level of bona fide services the Officer will perform, whether as an employee or consultant, will permanently decrease to 20 percent or less of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or contractor) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services to the Company if the Officer provided services to the Company for less than 36 months).
   
TRANSITION PERIOD.  For purposes of this agreement, the Transition Period shall be a oneyear period immediately following the date of the Officers Separation from Service.
4(a).
  
-
, except as provided in Section 4(b) hereof
4(b).
 
 
ADDITIONAL TRANSITION PERIOD.  During the first two years of the Officers employment with the Company, the Officers Transition Period shall be extended by an additional two years, provided, however that (i) the additional two years will be reduced over the Officers first two years of service on a daily basis, pro rata, so that the standard one-year Transition Period applies at the end of such two years and (ii) if the Officer chooses to leave the Company voluntarily during his first two years of service, such additional two-year extension, or remaining pro-rata amount thereof, will automatically be eliminated.  At the end of (i) above, or in the event of (ii) above, the Officers Transition Period will be the standard one-year period as provided in 4(a).
 
Severance Agreement - 1
5(a).COMPENSATION DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD.  Provided the Officer complies with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Noncompete Agreement, the Officer, or the Officer's estate in the event of the Officer's death, will receive during the Transition Period compensation and cash in lieu of employee benefits as provided on Exhibit 5(a), attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
  
5(b).EXECUTIVE BONUS AFTER LOSS OF OFFICER STATUS.  An Officer who ceases to be an Officer but does not cease to be an employee of the Company, and who has not yet incurred a Separation from Service (referred to herein as a "Non-Officer Employee"), shall receive, in lieu of an executive bonus pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii) of Exhibit 5(a), an executive bonus, if at all, subject to the following terms and conditions:
 
 
If as of the date of the Officers loss of officer status the Non-Officer Employee was a designated participant for an executive bonus plan performance period but the board of directors or a committee thereof has not yet taken action on any required goal achievement certification for such performance period, the Non-Officer Employee will be entitled to receive his or her executive bonus in the amount so certified, at the same time and in the same manner as the continuing officers of the Company receive payment of their executive bonuses for such performance period, if and only if (A) the specified goals are achieved, as certified by the Company's board of directors or a committee thereof, (B) payment is made for such achievement pursuant to the terms and conditions of the bonus program to the other participating officers, (C) the Non-Officer Employee is an employee of the Company at the time of payment and (D) the Non-Officer Employee complies with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Noncompete Agreement.
A Non-Officer Employee that receives a bonus pursuant to the term of this Section 5(b) shall not be entitled to receive an additional bonus pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii) of Exhibit 5(a) during his or her Transition Period.
5(c).FURTHER CLARIFICATIONS.  It is understood that the Officer, during the period of time in which he or she is a Non-Officer Employee and at any time during the Transition Period, is not entitled to renew his or her participation in any executive bonus program, receive any new grants of stock options or restricted stock or to the accrual of TOP time (however, Non-Officer Employees would participate in the Companys Time Off Plan). It is further understood that the Officer is not entitled to payment of any compensation that is deferred past the Transition Period due to payment criteria of an incentive program, as those criteria existed as of the date of the Officers Separation from Service.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Officer shall not be entitled to any payment which is earned and payable after the Transition Period pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan or program.  No action by the Company or the Companys Board of Directors may affect the Officers receipt of the benefits set forth above, other than as provided herein.
 
 
pursuant to this Agreement
Severance Agreement - 2
5(d).GROSS-UP CALCULATIONS.  All compensation provided pursuant to this Agreement is subject to applicable taxes and withholding.  All gross-up calculations and payments will be based on the standard supplemental withholding rates provided by federal and state guidelines.  The Company will not use the Officers personal effective tax rate for these calculations.  Gross-up payments will be considered as compensation on the Officers W-2 at the end of the year.
  
6.CONFIDENTIALITY.  The reasons for, and circumstances of, an Officers termination of employment or change in officer status shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed; provided that the Company may disclose such information as the Company determines, in its sole discretion, is either required by law to be disclosed or necessary to be disclosed to serve a valid business purpose.
   
7.RELEASE.  Upon receipt of all benefits under this Agreement, the Officer and Company settle, waive, and voluntarily release any and all claims each has or may have against the other, inclusive of any of the Companys affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents, both individually and in their official capacities, which claims are accruing prior to the end of the Transition Period.
   
8.FINAL AGREEMENT.  Except as set forth below, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, and is the entire and final understanding of the parties as to the subject matter hereof.  No modification of, or amendment to, this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing signed by both parties.  This Agreement is in addition to, and does not supersede or modify in any fashion, the provisions of the Noncompete Agreement entered into by the parties hereto or the provisions of any Assignment of Rights & Inventions and/or Confidential Information agreements previously executed by Officer in favor of Micron (collectively, Additional Agreements).  The obligations contained in the Additional Agreements shall continue independent of the obligations of one another and of this Agreement.  For avoidance of doubt, the Period of Restriction as defined in the Noncompete Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Noncompete Agreement.
   
9.409A COMPLIANCE; TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit that would constitute non-exempt deferred compensation for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 409A and the applicable Treasury Regulations (together, Section 409A) would otherwise be payable or distributable under this Agreement by reason of the Officers Separation from Service during a period in which the Officer is a Specified Employee (as defined below), then, subject to any permissible acceleration of payment by the Company under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order), (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of employment taxes):
   
(i) if the payment or distribution is payable in a lump sum, the Officers right to receive payment or distribution of such non-exempt deferred compensation will be delayed until the earlier of the Officers death or the first day of the seventh month following the Officers Separation from Service; and
   
Severance Agreement - 3
(ii) if the payment or distribution is payable over time, the amount of such non-exempt deferred compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following the Officers Separation from Service will be accumulated and the Officers right to receive payment or distribution of such
   
accumulated amount will be delayed until the earlier of the Officers death or the first day of the seventh month following the Officers Separation from Service, whereupon the accumulated amount will be paid or distributed to the Officer and the normal payment or distribution schedule for any remaining payments or distributions will resume.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term Specified Employee has the meaning given such term in Section 409A, provided, however, that, as permitted in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(i), the Companys Specified Employees and its application of the six-month delay rule of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) shall be determined in accordance with rules adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which shall be applied consistently with respect to all nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements of the Company, including this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement, effective as of
April 9, 2008.
