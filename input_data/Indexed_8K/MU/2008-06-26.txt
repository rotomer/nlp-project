On June 26, 2008, the Company announced its financial results for the quarter ended May 29, 2008.  The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company began pursuing a number of initiatives to drive greater cost efficiencies and revenue growth across its operations.  These initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas of the Company as the Companys business is realigned.  Additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to the Companys global customers, evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the Companys overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks.
In the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, the Company recorded charges of $8 million and $29 million, respectively, for employee severance and related costs, a write-down of certain facilities to their fair values, and relocation and retention bonuses.  Since the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company has incurred $48 million due to the restructuring initiatives.  The Company anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of fiscal 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives, but is currently unable to estimate the aggregate amount of the charges.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding future restructure charges. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents the Company files on a consolidated basis from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the Company's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results for the Company on a consolidated basis to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements (see Certain Factors). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform to actual results.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
, June 26, 2008  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results of operations for the companys third quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended May 29, 2008. For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the company posted a net loss of $236 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.5 billion. These results compare to GAAP results for the second quarter of a net loss of $777 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, or on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter (which exclude the effect of a goodwill impairment charge) of a net loss of $314 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.4 billion.
BOISE, Idaho
 
The companys net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 10 percent compared to the second quarter primarily from higher sales of both DRAM and NAND Flash memory products. Sales of DRAM products in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased compared to the second quarter as a result of an approximate 10 percent increase in gigabit sales, partially offset by an approximate 5 percent decrease in average selling prices. For the same periods, sales of NAND Flash products increased as a result of an approximate 40 percent increase in gigabit sales, partially offset by an approximate 20 percent decrease in the average selling price. The dollar amount of finished goods inventories for memory products at the end of the third quarter remained fairly stable compared to the second quarter, as higher levels of production were substantially offset by the higher sales volumes and improvements in the companys manufacturing costs per bit. Cost of goods sold per gigabit in the third quarter decreased approximately 15 percent and 25 percent compared to the second quarter for DRAM and NAND Flash memory products, respectively.
 
 
 
Micron continues to execute strongly on its cost reductions through advanced technology deployment and 300 millimeter manufacturing efficiencies, resulting in a positive gross margin in the third quarter, said Mark Durcan, Micron President and Chief Operating Officer. The combination of our premium product portfolio plus recent substantial cost per bit reductions has positioned us well.
 
Sales of CMOS image sensors in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 27 percent compared to the second quarter and represented 11 percent of the companys total sales in the third quarter. The companys gross margin on sales of imaging products improved to 35 percent in the third quarter compared to 24 percent in the second quarter, reflecting a greater mix of higher megapixel sensors.
 
The company generated $217 million in cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and investments. The company had capital expenditures during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 of $577 million and expects total capital expenditures for the 2008 fiscal year to be between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, TECH Semiconductor, a consolidated joint venture, entered into a $600 million credit facility to refinance its existing debt of $240 million and to finance future capital expenditures.
 
The company will host a conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MDT to discuss its financial results. The call, audio and slides will be available online at www.micron.com. A webcast replay will be available on the companys Web site until June 26, 2009.
