FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
, October 1, 2008  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results of operations for its fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year, which ended August 28, 2008. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the company posted a net loss of $344 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.45 billion. These results include a non-cash charge to cost of goods sold of $205 million to write down the value of work in process and finished goods inventories of memory products to their estimated market values and the effect of a recovery of $70 million for price adjustments for NAND products purchased from other suppliers in prior periods. For the 2008 fiscal year, the company posted a net loss of $1.6 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share on net sales of $5.8 billion. The annual results also include the effect of a non-cash charge of $463 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to write off the carrying value of goodwill previously recognized in the companys memory segment. Absent the effects of the fourth quarter inventory write-down, the NAND Flash price adjustments and second quarter goodwill write-off, net loss would have been $209 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and $1,021 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, for the 2008 fiscal year. In the fourth quarter and for the 2008 fiscal year, the company generated $243 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, in cash flows from operating activities and ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments.
BOISE, Idaho
 
 The global memory market continues to experience severe oversupply and price degradation, and it remains a challenging period for all of us competing in the industry, said Steve Appleton, Micron Chairman and CEO. Micron has pursued various initiatives in the past year to drive greater cost efficiencies across our operations and has made significant progress as shown by our cost per bit reductions and the contribution of cash flow from operations to the balance sheet. Consistent with these efforts and in view of market conditions, we are implementing a 20 percent reduction in salary compensation for Micron senior executives, while we continue to diligently work through our business planning process to ensure the competitiveness and long-term success of the company.
  
 
Sales of memory products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased 4 percent compared to the third quarter. Sales of DRAM products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased slightly compared to the preceding quarter primarily as a result of an approximate 5 percent decrease in gigabit sales. Comparing the same periods for NAND Flash products, sales decreased approximately 10 percent as a result of an approximate 20 percent decrease in the average selling price, partially offset by an approximate 10 percent increase in gigabit sales.
 
Absent the effect of the inventory write-down in the fourth quarter and the NAND Flash price adjustments, the companys gross margin on sales of memory products was slightly positive, with cost of goods sold per gigabit in the fourth quarter decreasing approximately 5 percent and 15 percent for DRAM and NAND Flash products, respectively, compared to the third quarter. Inventories for memory products decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the third quarter partially as a result of the write-down at the end of the fourth quarter.
 
Sales of CMOS image sensors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 increased slightly compared to the third quarter and represented 12 percent of the companys total sales in the fourth quarter. The companys gross margin on sales of imaging products during the fourth quarter decreased to 29 percent compared to 35 percent in the third quarter, primarily due to lower average selling prices.
 
The company will host a conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MDT to discuss its financial results. The call, audio and slides will be available online at . A webcast replay will be available on the companys Web site until Oct. 1, 2009.

SECTION  12.      Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominees and Stockholder Business
(a)  To be properly brought before  an annual meeting or  special meeting, nominations for the election of directors or other business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
(b)  For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date specified in the corporation's proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous  year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was  held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i)  a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting  such business at the annual meeting,  (ii) the name and address, as they  appear on  the  corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of  the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv)  any  material interest of the stockholder in such business and  (v) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under  the securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholders' meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12. The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12, and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
 
 
(c)   Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors  of the  corporation  may  be  made  at  a meeting of stockholders by or  at  the direction of the Board of Directors or by  any stockholder of the corporation entitled to  vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with  the notice procedures set  forth in    this paragraph (c).

At the request  of the Board   of   Directors, any   person nominated   by a   stockholder for election  as a director shall  furnish to  the  Secretary of the  corporation that  information required to  be  set forth  in the stockholder's notice  of nomination  which  pertains to the nominee.  No person shall be eligible for  election  as  a director  of  the corporation unless   nominated in accordance  with  the procedures  set forth  in  this  paragraph  (c).  The chairman of the meeting shall, if  the facts warrant, determine and  declare at  the meeting that a nomination was not made  in  accordance  with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws; and  if he should so determine,  he shall  so declare at the meeting,  and the  defective nomination  shall   be disregarded.
