EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
, December 23, 2008  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results of operations for the companys first quarter of fiscal 2009, which ended December 4, 2008. For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the company posted a net loss of $706 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.4 billion. These results reflect a non-cash charge to cost of goods sold of $369 million to write down the value of work in process and finished goods inventories of memory products to their estimated market values and a benefit of $157 million from first quarter sales of products that were subject to previous write-downs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the company generated $359 million in cash flow from operating activities and ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.0 billion.
BOISE, Idaho
 
Sales of the companys memory products in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 decreased 4 percent compared to the preceding quarter as a result of significant decreases in market selling prices for the companys products, partially offset by a higher sales volume. The companys sales measured in gigabits increased 35 percent and 40 percent for DRAM and NAND Flash products, respectively. The sales volume, which outpaced production during the first quarter, resulted in a 15 percent decrease in gigabits of the companys finished goods inventories during the quarter. Average selling prices for the companys memory products decreased 34 percent and 24 percent for DRAM and NAND Flash products, respectively.
 
The companys reported gross margin decreased in the first quarter compared to the preceding quarter as decreases in per gigabit average selling prices for memory products outpaced decreases in cost. Comparing the first quarter to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, absent the effects of the first quarter and prior period inventory write-downs, per gigabit costs decreased 12 percent and 14 percent for DRAM and NAND Flash products, respectively.
 
The companys cost-cutting and restructuring activities have yielded reductions in operating costs in nearly all areas and contributed to the companys cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter.
 
 
 
 
Sales of CMOS image sensors in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were relatively stable compared to the preceding quarter. The companys gross margin on sales of Imaging products also remained stable compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting a slight decrease in costs per part.
