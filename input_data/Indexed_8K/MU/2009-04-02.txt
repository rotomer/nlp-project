On April 2, 2009, the Company announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 5, 2009.  The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, the Company initiated restructure plans in 2009.  In the first quarter of 2009, IM Flash, a joint venture between the Company and Intel, terminated its agreement with the Company to obtain NAND Flash memory supply from the Companys Boise facility, reducing the Companys NAND Flash production by approximately 35,000 200mm wafers per month.  In addition, the Company and Intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of NAND Flash production at IM Flashs Singapore wafer fabrication facility.  On February 23, 2009, the Company announced that it will phase out all remaining 200mm wafer manufacturing operations at its Boise, Idaho, facility, reducing employment there by as many as 2,000 positions by the end of fiscal 2009.
                As a result of these actions, the Company recorded a net $66 million credit to restructure in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and a restructure charge of $105 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, primarily attributable to the Companys Memory segment.  The net credit in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 includes a $144 million gain in connection with the termination of the NAND Flash supply agreement, charges of $56 million to reduce the carrying value of certain 200mm wafer manufacturing equipment at its Boise, Idaho facility and charges of $22 million for severance and other termination benefits.  The charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 includes charges of $87 million to reduce the carrying value of certain 200mm wafer manufacturing equipment at its Boise, Idaho facility and charges of $17 million for severance and other termination benefits.  Excluding any gains or losses from sales of equipment, the Company expects to incur additional restructure costs through fiscal 2009 of approximately $27 million, comprised primarily of severance and other employee related costs.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
, April 2, 2009  Micron Technology, Inc., (NYSE: MU) today announced results of operations for the companys second quarter of fiscal 2009, which ended March 5, 2009. For the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the company posted a net loss of $751 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.0 billion. These results reflect a number of cash and non-cash items resulting in a net charge of $120 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The company ended the quarter with cash and investments of $932 million.
BOISE, Idaho
 
The imbalance of supply and demand for semiconductor memory products continued in the second quarter, resulting in significant decreases in the companys per gigabit average selling prices compared to the preceding quarter. Revenue from sales of DRAM products decreased approximately 30 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter principally due to a 30 percent decrease in selling prices. Sales volumes for DRAM products remained relatively stable comparing the same periods. Revenue from sales of NAND Flash products decreased 20 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to a 13 percent decrease in selling prices and an eight percent decrease in sales volume.
 
Memory production in the second quarter was relatively flat compared to the preceding quarter. Increases in bit production of NAND Flash products resulting from the companys transitions to higher density 34nm NAND Flash products were offset by decreases in production resulting from the companys decision to slow down DRAM production at its 200mm facilities and to discontinue production of 200mm NAND Flash wafers at its Boise facility.
 
We are actively managing our overall cost structure, capital expenditures and technology execution, which are driving our operating margins ahead of industry trend lines, said Steve Appleton, Micron Chairman and CEO. Notably, our 34nm NAND technology is ramping rapidly and is providing a competitive differentiation in this challenging economic environment.
 
The companys gross margin on sales of memory products improved 11 percent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, resulting from decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs and the benefit in the second quarter from sales of products previously written-down, partially offset by decreases in selling prices. Cost of goods sold includes charges for unused production capacity, including charges from the companys Inotera and IM Flash joint ventures. Excluding the effects of the inventory write-downs and idle capacity charges, per gigabit costs declined significantly for both DRAM and NAND Flash products.
 
Sales of CMOS image sensors in the second quarter decreased 54 percent compared to the preceding quarter as a result of a sharp decline in unit sales stemming from weakness in consumer markets. The companys gross margin on sales of Imaging products was two percent in the second quarter compared to 29 percent in the first quarter, primarily resulting from higher per unit manufacturing costs associated with a significant decrease in the level of production.
 
The companys cost-cutting and restructuring activities have yielded reductions in operating costs and contributed to the companys cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. In addition, the company recently announced that it will phase out the remaining 200mm wafer production at its Boise facility. As a result, the company recorded a restructure charge of $105 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, including $17 million of employee-related costs and $87 million of equipment write-downs.
 
The company will host a conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MDT to discuss its financial results. The call, audio and slides will be available online at www.micron.com. A webcast replay will be available on the companys web site until April 2, 2010.
