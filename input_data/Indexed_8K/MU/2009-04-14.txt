Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Convertible Senior Notes due October 15, 2013
 
On April 8, 2009, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Micron"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Note Underwriting Agreement") with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representatives (the "Representatives") of the underwriters (collectively, the "Underwriters") to issue and sell $200 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due October 15, 2013 (the "Notes") in a public offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") and a related prospectus, including the related prospectus supplement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Micron granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $30 million aggregate principal amount of Notes solely to cover over-allotments. On April 9, 2009, the Representatives exercised this option in full. Micron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the Underwriters' option to purchase the additional Notes, will be approximately $223.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Note Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.
 
Common Stock
 
On April 8, 2009, Micron also entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Common Stock Underwriting Agreement") with the Representatives of the Underwriters to issue and sell 60,240,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company in a public offering pursuant to the Registration Statement and a related prospectus, including the related prospectus supplement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Micron granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 9,036,000 shares of Common Stock solely to cover over-allotments. On April 9, 2009, the Representatives exercised this option in full. Micron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the Underwriters' option to purchase the additional shares of Common Stock, will be approximately $275.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Common Stock Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Capped Call Transactions
 
In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company also entered into capped call transactions with the following entities affiliated with the Underwriters: one capped call transaction with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "Goldman Sachs Capped Call"), one capped call transaction with Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (the "Morgan Stanley Capped Call") and one capped call transaction with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the "Deutsche Bank Capped Call" and collectively with the Goldman Sachs Capped Call and the Morgan Stanley Capped Call, the "Capped Calls"). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $5.08 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the Notes.  The Capped Calls have a cap price of $6.64 per share. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments similar to those contained in the Notes, an approximate combined total of 45.2 million shares of Common Stock (after adjustment for the Underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option pursuant to the Note Underwriting Agreement), of which amount the Goldman Sachs Capped Call covers 45%, the Morgan Stanley Capped Call covers 35% and the Deutsche Bank Capped Call covers 20%. The Capped Calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. If, however, the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, exceeds the applicable cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of the Common Stock exceeds the cap price. Micron paid approximately $24.7 million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls expire in three and one-half years. The Goldman Sachs Capped Call is filed as Exhibit 10.1, the Morgan Stanley Capped Call is filed as Exhibit 10.2 and the Deutsche Bank Capped Call is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The summary of the foregoing transactions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Note Underwriting Agreement, the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement and Capped Calls, which are included as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

Covenants of the Underwriters
.  Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
 
8.
                            
Indemnity and Contribution.
  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, (and other than with respect to the Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
(b)
                        
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers who sign the Registration Statement, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)
                         
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                        
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)
                         
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)
                           
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of any Underwriter or by or
on behalf of the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents, or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
9.
                            
Termination
.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (a) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (b) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange, (c) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (d) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York or Idaho State authorities or (e) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Representatives' judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause 9, makes it, in the Representatives' judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
 
10.
                      
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
 
If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default,
this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company.

If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

SCHEDULE I
 
This term sheet to the preliminary prospectus supplement dated April 7, 2009 should be read together with the preliminary prospectus supplement before making a decision in connection with an investment in the securities.  The information in this term sheet supersedes the information contained in the preliminary prospectus supplement to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith.  Terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the preliminary prospectus supplement.
 
 
The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth in the above table, in which case:
 
                 
if the stock price is between two stock prices in the table above or the effective date is between two effective dates in the table above, the make-whole shares issued upon conversion of the notes will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of make-whole shares set forth for the higher and lower stock prices and/or the earlier and later effective dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
 
                 
if the stock price is in excess of $50.00 per share of common stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the stock prices set forth in the table above), no make-whole shares will be issued upon conversion of the notes; and
 
                 
if the stock price is less than $4.15 per share of common stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the stock prices set forth in the table above), no make-whole shares will be issued upon conversion of the notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion rate of the notes shall not exceed 240.9638 per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as described in the preliminary prospectus supplement dated April 7, 2009 under "Description of NotesAdjustment to Conversion RateGeneral."
 
The Issuer's obligation to deliver the make-whole shares could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceability of our obligation to deliver make-whole shares would be subject to general principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.
 
Concurrent Offering of Common Stock
 
Concurrently with this offering, pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement, the Issuer priced an underwritten public offering of 60,240,000 shares (69,276,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option with respect to that offering in full) of the Issuer's common stock (the "Common Stock Offering").  Neither the completion of the Common Stock Offering nor the completion of this offering is contingent on the completion of the other.  Assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option with respect to the Common Stock Offering, the net proceeds of the Common Stock Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, will be approximately $239.7 million, based on a public offering price of $4.15 per share.
 
Modifications to the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement
 
Capitalization
 
Outstanding common stock does not include (i) 190.0 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our equity plans, under which options and restricted stock units to purchase 124.1 million shares were outstanding as of March 5, 2009, at a weighted average exercise price of $16.09 per share, (ii) 3.9 million shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of stock rights held by Intel Corporation and (iii) shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes offered hereby and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion, if any, of the 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2014.
(1)
         
 
Subsidiary Indebtedness
 
On pages S-4, S-21 and S-32 of the preliminary prospectus supplement, the disclosure has been revised to clarify that as of March 5, 2009, the Issuer's subsidiaries had unsecured liabilities (including trade and other payables but excluding intercompany indebtedness) outstanding in an amount of $1,274 million.
 
The Issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus and a related preliminary prospectus supplement) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the preliminary prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus in the registration statement and the other documents the Issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Issuer and the offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting IDEA on the SEC's web site at .

(v)
                                
The Securities are in the form contemplated by the Indenture, have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered against the purchase price therefor specified herein (which fact such counsel may state has not been determined by inspection of the Securities), will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms; and the Securities are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
 
(vi)

(vii)
                          
None of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the issuance of the shares of Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities or the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated thereby will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (A) the charter or by-laws of the Company or (B) any statute, decree, regulation or order known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company of any Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties or assets, except such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults in clause (B) above as would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to perform its obligations under such agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby;
 
(viii)
                       
No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters;
 
(ix)

The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus under the caption "Description of Notes" and "Description of Capital Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and such capital stock, fairly summarize such terms and documents in all material respects;
 
(xi)
                               
The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations", insofar as they purport to summarize provisions of the United States federal tax laws referred to therein, fairly summarize such laws in all material respects.
 
 
In addition, such counsel shall state that it has participated in conferences with certain officers and other representatives of the Company, the Underwriters, counsel for the Underwriters, and the independent certified public accountants of the Company, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus and related matters were reviewed
and discussed.  Although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus (other than as set forth in paragraphs (x) and (xi) above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention, in the course of such review and discussion, that have caused it to believe that,
 
(i)
                                     
the Registration Statement at the time each part became effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief);
 
(ii)
                                  
the Time of Sale Prospectus, together with the documents listed on an exhibit to such counsel's opinion (the "Time of Sale Prospectus"), all considered together, as of            P.M. (PST) on                       , 2009, and the date of such counsel's opinion contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief); or
 
(iii)
                               
the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date of such counsel's opinion, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief).
 
In addition, such counsel confirms to you that (i) the Registration Statement, when it became effective, (ii) the Time of Sale Prospectus, as of its date (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel express no belief), and (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief) each appeared on their face to comply, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
under the Securities Act.  For purposes of this paragraph, such counsel has assumed that the statements made in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus are correct and complete.
EXHIBIT C
 
(i)
                                    
To the best of such counsel's knowledge, but without inquiring into dockets of any court, commissions, regulatory body, administrative agency or other government body, and other than as set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or of which any property or assets of the Company is the subject, which such counsel believes individually or in the aggregate would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its subsidiaries;
 
(ii)
                                 
The shares of Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities are free of preemptive rights under any agreement known to me;
 
(iii)
                              
None of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the issuance of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities or the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated thereby will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (A) any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (B) any statute, decree, regulation or order applicable to the Company of United States federal or Idaho court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties or assets, except such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to perform its obligations under such agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby;
 
(iv)
                             
Except as may be required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or "blue sky" laws of any state of the United States, in connection with the sale of the Securities, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any United States federal or Idaho court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Indenture by the Company and the issuance of the Securities and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby; and
 
(v)
                                
The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements and notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting or financial nature either included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not
express an opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

The Company agrees that, prior to the date that is 90 days after the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of each of the Representatives, it will not waive any of the restrictions set forth in any of the lock-up agreements that qualify an issuance for the exception set forth in clause (e) of the preceding sentence.
 
.  Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.

Covenants of the Underwriters
 
  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action

or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, (and other than with respect to the Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers who sign the Registration Statement, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(b)
                                
 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to
(c)
                                 
indemnified party
indemnifying party
the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the
(d)
                                
Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(e)
                                 
pro rata
 
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents, or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
(f)
                                   
 
.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago

.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
10.
                                
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the number of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the number of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such number of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the number of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the number of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the number of Additional Securities with
respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the number of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
.  (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
11.
                                
Entire Agreement
 
The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.

SCHEDULE I
 
60,240,000 Shares of Common Stock
 
This term sheet to the preliminary prospectus supplement dated April 7, 2009 should be read together with the preliminary prospectus supplement before making a decision in connection with an investment in the securities.  The information in this term sheet supersedes the information contained in the preliminary prospectus supplement to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith.  Terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the preliminary prospectus supplement.
 
 
Concurrent Offering of Convertible Senior Notes
 
Concurrently with this offering of common stock, pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement, we priced an underwritten public offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due October 15, 2013 (or $230 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due October 15, 2013 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) (the "Convertible Senior Notes Offering").  Neither the completion of this offering nor of the Convertible Senior Notes Offering is contingent on the completion of the other.  Assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option with respect to the Convertible Senior Notes Offering, the net proceeds of the Convertible Senior Notes Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, will be approximately $194.2 million.
 
The convertible senior notes will be convertible at the holder's option into shares of the Issuer's common stock at a conversion rate of 196.7052 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $5.08 per share of the Issuer's common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  This initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 22.50% relative to the public offering price of the Issuer's common stock of $4.15 per share.
 
In connection with the Convertible Senior Note Offering, the Issuer entered into capped call transactions with counterparties, which are affiliated with some of the underwriters of the offering.  The capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 39.3 million shares (or approximately 45.2 million shares if the underwriters of the Convertible Senior
 
Notes Offering exercise their over-allotment option in full) of the Issuer's common stock. The Issuer estimates the cost of the capped call transactions to be approximately $21.5 million, or $24.7 million if the underwriters of the Convertible Senior Notes Offering exercise their over-allotment option in full.
The capped call transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes. The capped call transactions have a capped price that is 60% higher than the public offering price of the Issuer's common stock in this offering. In connection with establishing their initial hedge of these capped call transactions, the Issuer expects that the counterparties will enter into various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to the Issuer's common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the convertible senior notes and may unwind or enter into various over-the-counter derivatives and/or purchase the Issuer's common stock in secondary market transactions after the pricing of the convertible senior notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of the Issuer's common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the convertible senior notes. In addition, the counterparties may modify or unwind their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions and/or purchasing or selling the Issuer's common stock in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the convertible senior notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions).
 
Modifications to the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement

Although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus (other than as set forth in paragraph (vii) above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention, in the course of such review and discussion, that have caused it to believe that,
 
the Registration Statement at the time each part became effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief);
(i)
                                     
 
the Time of Sale Prospectus, together with the documents listed on an exhibit to such counsel's opinion, all considered together, as of          P.M.

(ii)
                                  
 
the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date of such counsel's opinion, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief).
(iii)
                               
 
In addition, such counsel confirms to you that (i) the Registration Statement, when it became effective, (ii) the Time of Sale Prospectus, as of its date (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel express no belief), and (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which such counsel expresses no belief) each appeared on their face to comply, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act.  For purposes of this paragraph, such counsel has assumed that the statements made in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus are correct and complete.
 
EXHIBIT C
 
To the best of such counsel's knowledge, but without inquiring into dockets of any court, commissions, regulatory body, administrative agency or other government body, and other than as set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or of which any property or assets of the Company is the subject, which such counsel believes individually or in the aggregate would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its subsidiaries;
(i)
                                    
 
The Securities are free of preemptive rights under any agreement known to me;
(ii)
                                 
 
None of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Securities, or the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated thereby will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (A) any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (B) any statute, decree, regulation or order applicable to the Company of United States federal or Idaho court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties or assets, except such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to perform its obligations under such agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby;
(iii)
                              
 
(iv) Except as may be required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or "blue sky" laws of any state of the United States, in connection with the sale of the Securities, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any United States federal or Idaho court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the issuance of the Securities and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby; and
 
The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements and notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting or financial nature either included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not express an opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to
(v)
                                
 
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

In the event that Counterparty fails to provide Dealer with a Repurchase Notice on the day and in the manner specified in this Section 7, then Counterparty to the extent permitted by law agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Dealer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (Dealer and each such person being an "") from and against any and all losses (including losses relating to Dealer's hedging activities as a consequence of becoming, or of the risk of becoming, a Section 16 "insider," including without limitation any forbearance from hedging activities or cessation of hedging activities and any losses in connection therewith with respect to this Transaction), claims, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Indemnified Person is subject, including without limitation, Section 16 of the Exchange Act), relating to or arising out of such failure.

This indemnity shall survive the completion of the Transaction contemplated by this Confirmation and any assignment and delegation of the Transaction made pursuant to this Confirmation or the Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any permitted assignee of Dealer.

("") or, if either S&P or Moody's ceases to rate such debt, at least an equivalent rating or better by a substitute agency rating mutually agreed by Counterparty and Dealer; provided however such Third Party Guarantor shall provide a guarantee in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Counterparty in connection with such transfer or assignment.  If, in the discretion of Dealer, Dealer is unable to effect such transfer or assignment after its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Dealer, Dealer may designate any Scheduled Trading Day as an Early Termination Date and an Additional Termination Date shall be deemed to occur with respect to a portion (the "") of this Transaction, allocated to Components as Dealer determines in its discretion, such that the Equity Percentage following such partial

termination will be equal to or less than 8.5%.  In the event that Dealer so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of this Transaction, a payment shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to this Transaction and a Number of Options equal to the Terminated Portion, (ii) Counterparty shall be the Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of this Transaction shall be the only Affected Transaction.  The "" as of any day is the fraction (A) the numerator of which is the number of Shares that Dealer or any of its affiliates that are subject to aggregation with Dealer beneficially own (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act) on such day and (B) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such day.

Equity Percentage
 
9.     .   Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date, the Final Disruption Date and the Number of Options for each such Component if Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be compliant with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Extension of Settlement
 
10.   .  Counterparty may elect to terminate this Transaction, in whole or in part, prior to the relevant Expiration Date, on terms acceptable to both parties, and, if such termination occurs following the payment of the premiums for all Components, without any payment being owed from Counterparty to Dealer.
Early Termination Right
 
11.   .  Dealer acknowledges and agrees that this Confirmation is not intended to convey to it rights with respect to the Transaction that are senior to the claims of common stockholders in the event of Counterparty's bankruptcy.  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the preceding sentence shall not apply at any time other than during Counterparty's bankruptcy to any claim arising as a result of a breach by Counterparty of any of its obligations under this Confirmation or the Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that this Confirmation is not secured by any collateral that would otherwise secure the obligations of Counterparty herein under or pursuant to any other agreement.
Equity Rights

In the event that Counterparty fails to provide Dealer with a Repurchase Notice on the day and in the manner specified in this Section 7, then Counterparty to the extent permitted by law agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Dealer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (Dealer and each such person being an "Indemnified Person") from and against any and all losses (including losses relating to Dealer's hedging activities as a consequence of becoming, or of the risk of becoming, a Section 16 "insider," including without limitation any forbearance from hedging activities or cessation of hedging activities and any losses in connection therewith with respect to this Transaction), claims, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Indemnified Person is subject, including without limitation, Section 16 of the Exchange Act), relating to or arising out of such failure.  If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any Indemnified Person or insufficient to hold harmless any Indemnified Person, then Counterparty shall contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Person as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability.  In addition, Counterparty will reimburse any Indemnified Person for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) as they are incurred (after notice to Counterparty) in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense or settlement of any pending or threatened claim or any action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation) arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Person is a party thereto and whether or not such claim, action, suit or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of Counterparty.  This indemnity shall survive the completion of the Transaction contemplated by this Confirmation and any assignment and delegation of the Transaction made pursuant to this Confirmation or the Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any permitted assignee of Dealer.  Issuer will not be liable under this indemnity provision to the extent any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final judgment by a court to have resulted from Dealer's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Transfer or Assignment
.  Neither party may transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Transaction
without the prior written consent of the non-transferring party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that if at any time the Equity Percentage exceeds 9%, Dealer may immediately, in its sole discretion, transfer or assign a number of Options sufficient to reduce the Equity Percentage to 8.5% to any affiliate of Dealer whose obligations are guaranteed by Deutsche Bank AG or any third party with (or with a guarantor (a "Third Party Guarantor") that has) a rating for its long-term, unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of A- or better by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or its successor ("S&P"), or A3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or, if either S&P or Moody's ceases to rate such debt, at least an equivalent rating or better by a substitute agency rating mutually agreed by Counterparty and Dealer; provided however such Third Party Guarantor shall provide a guarantee in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Counterparty in connection with such transfer or assignment.  If, in the discretion of Dealer, Dealer is unable to effect such transfer or assignment after its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Dealer, Dealer may designate any Scheduled Trading Day as an Early Termination Date and an Additional Termination Date shall be deemed to occur with respect to a portion (the "") of this Transaction, allocated to Components as Dealer determines in its discretion, such that the Equity Percentage following such partial termination will be equal to or less than 8.5%.  In the event that Dealer so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of this Transaction, a payment shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to this Transaction and a Number of Options equal to the Terminated Portion, (ii) Counterparty shall be the Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of this Transaction shall be the only Affected Transaction.  The "" as of any day is the fraction (A) the numerator of which is the number of Shares that Dealer or any of its affiliates that are subject to aggregation with Dealer beneficially own (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act) on such day and (B) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such day.  Notwithstanding Section 7 of the Agreement, Counterparty may assign its rights and obligations under this Transaction, in whole or in part, on terms reasonably acceptable to both parties, without any payment being owed from Counterparty to Dealer.
