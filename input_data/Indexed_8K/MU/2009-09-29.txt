On September 29, 2009, the Company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 3, 2009.  The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
In response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, the Company initiated restructure activities in 2009, which included terminating its agreement with IM Flash, a joint venture between the Company and Intel, to obtain NAND Flash memory supply from the Companys Boise facility; suspending the tooling and ramping of NAND Flash production at IM Flashs Singapore wafer fabrication facility; and phasing out all remaining 200mm wafer manufacturing operations at its Boise, Idaho, facility.
In the fourth quarter and 2009 fiscal year, the Company recorded charges of $12 million and $70 million, respectively, as a result of these restructure activities for employee severance and related costs; for relocation and retention bonuses; to write-down the carrying value of certain 200mm wafer manufacturing equipment at its Boise, Idaho facility; net of a gain recorded in connection with the termination of the NAND Flash supply agreement.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The market, while still challenging, is beginning to improve. Micron has been one of the only companies in the industry able to generate positive operating cash flow every quarter during this downturn. Our operating performance and ongoing cost improvements put Micron in a great competitive position going forward, said Steve Appleton, Micron Chairman and CEO.
 
Revenue from sales of DRAM products increased 28 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to a 19 percent increase in sales volumes and an 8 percent increase in average selling prices. Revenue from sales of NAND Flash products increased 10 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to a 23 percent increase in sales volumes. This was partially offset by an 11 percent decrease in average selling prices resulting primarily from reduced manufacturing costs associated with products sold to Intel Corporation, the companys NAND Flash manufacturing partner. Prices for NAND Flash products sold to Intel approximate cost, which decreased significantly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter as the transition to the companys 34 nanometer (nm) NAND process technology was substantially completed. Average selling prices for NAND Flash sales excluding those to Intel were relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter.
 
 
 
 
The companys gross margin on sales of memory products continued to improve from 11 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 to 12 percent in the fourth quarter. Cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter includes approximately $37 million of charges for unused production capacity at the companys Inotera and IM Flash joint ventures. There was no lower of cost or market write-down of memory inventories during the third or fourth quarters. When adjusted to exclude the effects of selling products subject to previous lower of cost or market write-downs and the idle capacity costs from Inotera and IM Flash, gross margins on sales of memory products improved to positive 8 percent in the fourth quarter compared to negative 12 percent in the third quarter as a result of significant decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs.
 
Unit sales from the companys imaging segment were approximately 30 percent higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the preceding quarter, the effect of which was essentially offset by a decline in the average selling price resulting from the transition during the quarter to wafer foundry sales of products. Gross margin on sales of imaging products however improved to 20 percent in the fourth quarter as compared to 2 percent in the third quarter primarily as a result of increased utilization of dedicated 200 millimeter (mm) manufacturing capacity.
