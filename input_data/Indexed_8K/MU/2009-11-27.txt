On October 11, 2008, Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) and Micron Semiconductor, B.V. (MNL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Qimonda AG (Qimonda) and Qimonda Holding B.V. (collectively with Qimonda, the Sellers), pursuant to which, among other things, in two separate closings MNL agreed to purchase 1,184,088,059 shares of common stock of Inotera Memories, Inc. (Inotera) held by the Sellers (the Share Purchase Transactions).
In connection with the second closing of the Share Purchase Transactions, on November 26, 2008, Micron and MNL entered into a loan agreement with Nan Ya Plastics Corporation (NPC) pursuant to which NPC made a loan to MNL (the NPC Loan) in the principal amount of $200 million, maturing November 26, 2009  (the NPC Loan Agreement).  The proceeds of the NPC Loan were used to pay the purchase price for certain of the shares of common stock of Inotera under the Purchase Agreement.  Pursuant to the NPC Loan Agreement, Micron guaranteed the NPC Loan.  The NPC Loan bears interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 2% and is secured by a pledge of the shares of common stock of Inotera held by MNL and by Micron Technology Asia Pacific, Inc. (MTT).
 
On November 25, 2009, MNL entered into a loan agreement with Mai Liao Power Corporation, an affiliate of NPC and NTC (Mai Liao), in the principal amount of $200 million (the Mai Liao Loan) on essentially the same terms of the NPC Loan (the Mai Liao Loan Agreement), the proceeds of which were used to repay the NPC Loan.  The Mai Liao Loan matures on November 24, 2010.  Pursuant to the Mai Liao Loan Agreement, Micron guaranteed the Mai Liao Loan.  The Mai Liao Loan bears interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 2% and is secured by a pledge of the shares of common stock of Inotera held by MNL and MTT.
The Mai Liao Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants including further assurances, compliance with laws, payment of taxes, maintenance of insurance and properties and notice of defaults or events of default.  The events of default under the Mai Liao Loan Agreement include the failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts due under the Mai Liao Loan Agreement and related pledge agreement beyond specified grace periods, the failure to perform material obligations or covenants under the Mai Liao Loan Agreement and related pledge agreement beyond a specified grace period, and bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to Micron or MNL.
 The foregoing description of the Mai Liao Loan Agreement is only a summary and does not purport to be complete.  The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this current report.
