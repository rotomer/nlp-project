EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
, June 28, 2010  Micron Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ: MU) today announced results of operations for its third quarter of fiscal 2010, which ended June 3, 2010. For the third quarter, the company had net income attributable to Micron shareholders of $939 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.29 billion. The results for the third quarter compare to net income of $365 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.96 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and a net loss of $301 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.11 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
BOISE, Idaho
 
The companys results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 include $488 million in purchase accounting gains relating to the Numonyx acquisition, $64 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to accruals for estimated settlements in the companys indirect purchasers antitrust case and other matters and a $41 million benefit to cost of goods sold for price adjustments from suppliers of NAND products.
 
In the companys Memory segment, revenue from sales of DRAM products increased 10 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010 due to a 9 percent increase in average selling prices and a slight increase in unit sales volume. Revenue from sales of NAND Flash products was approximately 16 percent higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to a 21 percent increase in unit sales volume, partially offset by a 4 percent decrease in average selling prices. The companys gross margin on sales of memory products improved from 35 percent in the second quarter to 40 percent in the third quarter, primarily due to an overall increase in average selling prices and the benefit for price adjustments from suppliers of NAND products.
 
The company generated $889 million in cash from operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and repaid $378 million of debt, a portion of which was repaid prior to its maturity. At the end of the third quarter, the company had cash and investments of more than $2.3 billion, an increase of $443 million compared to the end of the second quarter.
 
During the third quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Numonyx, a Swiss company which manufactures and sells NOR Flash, NAND Flash, DRAM and Phase Change non-volatile memory
 
 
 
 
technologies and products, in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the acquisition, the company issued approximately 138 million shares of Micron common stock to Numonyx shareholders and assumed all of the outstanding restricted stock units held by Numonyx employees. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the fair value of the consideration paid by the company and, as a result, the companys results of operations include a non-operating gain on the acquisition of Numonyx. The Numonyx operations added approximately $80 million to consolidated net sales for the third quarter at a nominal margin due to the application of purchase accounting. Numonyx is reported as a separate reportable segment while the company identifies its reporting structure with the integration of Numonyx into the Micron operations.< /font>
