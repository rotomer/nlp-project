Other Events.
 
On October 28, 2010, the Company entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Notes) to exchange in a private placement (the Exchange Transaction) $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes for $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of new 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the New Notes) of the Company.
 
In addition to the Exchange Transaction, the Company also entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2014 Notes to repurchase $175.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes for $170.6 million in cash (the 2014 Notes Repurchase).  The Exchange Transaction and the 2014 Notes Repurchase will together retire $350.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes.
 
The Company also entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes) to repurchase $91.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes for $166.5 million in cash (the 2013 Notes Repurchase).
 
The Company expects that the issuance of New Notes in the Exchange Transaction, the 2014 Notes Repurchase and the 2013 Notes Repurchase will each close on November 3, 2010.
 
The New Notes will have an interest rate of 1.875% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2011.  The New Notes will mature on June 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or converted.  The New Notes will have an initial conversion rate of 91.7431 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.10 per share (Common Stock), per $1,000 principal amount of New Notes, subject to adjustment, and will be convertible into (a) cash up to the aggregate principal amount of New Notes, and (b) shares of the Companys Common Stock or cash, at the Companys election, for the remainder, if any, of the Companys conversion obligation.  Prior to March 1, 2027, such conversion will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture for the New Notes.  Holders of the New Notes who convert their New Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control (as defined in the indenture for the New Notes) will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate.  Additionally, (i) in the event of a change in control or (ii) on June 1, 2017, holders of the New Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.  The Company may elect to redeem all or any portion of the New Notes on or after June 1, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
 
The Company may elect to terminate the conversion right of the New Notes if the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Common Stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period.
If the Company terminates the conversion right prior to June 1, 2014, each holder whose New Notes are converted prior to such termination of the conversion right will receive an additional make-whole payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of unpaid interest payments that would have been payable on the converted New Notes from the last day through which interest was paid on the New Notes to, but excluding, June 1, 2014.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture for the New Notes, the Company may, at its election, deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of cash with respect to this make-whole payment.
On October 28, 2010, the Company issued a press release with respect to the issuance of New Notes in the Exchange Transaction, the 2013 Notes Repurchase and the 2014 Notes Repurchase. A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Additionally, the repurchase of $91 million of 4.25% Notes and $176 million of Existing 1.875% Notes is expected to reduce shares used in the Companys fully diluted calculation by approximately 43 million beginning in itssecond quarter of fiscal 2011.
 
Description of the New 1.875% Notes
The New 1.875% Notes will be convertible under certain circumstances, at the holders option, at an initial conversion rate of 91.7431 common shares per $1,000 principal amount.

Holders of the New 1.875% Notes will have the option to require the company to purchase the notes on June 1, 2017, and in certain other circumstances, at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
