Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Convertible Senior Notes due 2031
 
On July 20, 2011, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Micron"), entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative (the "Representative") of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"), to issue and sell $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the "2031A Notes") and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the "2031B Notes" and together with the 2031A Notes, the "Notes") in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, Micron granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2031A Notes and up to an additional $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2031B Notes on the same terms and conditions to cover over-allotments, if any. On July 22, 2011, the Representative exercised this option in full. Micron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase the additional Notes, will be approximately $672.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On July 26, 2011, Micron entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), relating to the 2031A Notes (the "2031A Indenture") and an indenture with the Trustee, relating to the 2031B Notes (the "2031B Indenture" and together with the 2031A Indenture, the "Indentures"). The 2031A Indenture and the form of global note for the 2031A Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and the 2031B Indenture and the form of global note for the 2031B Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  The 2031A Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year on the principal amount and the 2031B Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.875% per year on the principal amount, in each case accruing from July 26, 2011. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2012. The Notes will mature on August 1, 2031, subject to earlier conversion, redemption or repurchase.
 
The initial conversion rate for the 2031A Notes is 105.2632 shares of Micron's common stock, par value $0.10 per share ("Common Stock"), per $1,000 principal amount of 2031A Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.50 per share of Common Stock. The initial conversion rate for the 2031B Notes is 105.2632 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2031B Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.50 per share of Common Stock. Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) if the Notes are called for redemption; (2) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after September 30, 2011, and only during such calendar quarter, if the closing price of Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price for the Notes per share of Common Stock, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (3) during the five business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of Common Stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (4) if specified distributions to holders of Common Stock are made or specified corporate events occur; or (5) at any time on or after May 1, 2031.
 
Upon conversion, Micron will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted and cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at Micron's option, for the remainder, if any, of Micron's conversion obligations.
 
If a holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control, as defined in the Indentures, Micron will, in certain circumstances, pay a make-whole premium by increasing the conversion rate for the Notes converted in connection with such make-whole change in control. Micron may not redeem the 2031A Notes prior to August 5, 2013 and may not redeem the 2031B Notes prior to August 5,
 
2014. On or after August 5, 2013, in the case of the 2031A Notes, and on or after August 5, 2014, in the case of the 2031B Notes, Micron may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the last reported sale price of Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to the date on which Micron provides notice of redemption.  The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.  If Micron redeems the Notes prior to August 5, 2015, in the case of the 2031A Notes, or prior to August 5, 2016, in the case of the 2031B Notes, Micron will also make a "make-whole premium" payment in cash equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest on the Notes to be redeemed through August 5, 2015, in the case of the 2031A Notes, or through August 5, 2016, in the case of the 2031B Notes.  The present value of the remaining interest payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to 150 basis points.  On or after August 5, 2015, in the case of the 2031A Notes, and on or after August 5, 2016, in the case of the 2031B Notes, Micron may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
 
On August 1, 2018, with respect to the 2031A Notes, and on August 1, 2020, with respect to the 2031B Notes, the holders may require Micron to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  Upon a change in control or a termination of trading, as defined in the Indenture, the holders may require Micron to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
 
The Notes are Micron's general, unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of Micron's existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the assets securing such debt, and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Micron's subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Indentures do not limit the amount of indebtedness that Micron or any of its subsidiaries may incur.
 
The following events are considered "Events of Default," which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of each series of Notes under the applicable Indenture:
 
                 
Micron's failure to pay when due the principal on any of the Notes at maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
                 
Micron's failure to pay interest on any of the Notes for 30 days after the date when due;
                 
Micron's failure to give timely notice of a termination of trading, a change of control or a make-whole change in control (each as defined in the Indentures) that does not constitute a change in control, which continues for a period of three business days;
                 
Micron's failure to comply with its obligation to convert the Notes into cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock upon exercise of a holder's conversion right;
                 
Micron's failure to perform or observe any other covenants or agreement under the Notes or the applicable Indenture governing the Notes and Micron fails to cure or obtain a waiver of such default for a period of 60 days after receiving notice of such failure;
                 
A default by Micron under any debt (as defined in the Indentures) that results in acceleration of such debt, or the failure to pay any such debt at maturity, in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $100 million, and such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled within 30 days;
                 
Certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to Micron or any significant subsidiary.
 
The summary of the foregoing transactions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Purchase Agreement and Indentures, each of which are included as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
Capped Call Transactions
 
In connection with the offering of the Notes, on July 20, 2011, Micron also entered into capped call transactions with Socit Gnrale (the "Initial Capped Calls"). The Initial Capped Calls each have a lower strike price of $9.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the Notes.  The Initial Capped Calls have cap prices that range from $11.40 to $13.17 per share. The Initial Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 63.2 million shares of Common Stock.  In connection with the Initial Purchasers' exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes, Micron entered into additional capped call transactions with BNP Paribas and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (the "Additional Capped Calls" and together with the Initial Capped Calls, the "Capped Calls").  The Additional Capped Calls each have a lower strike price of $9.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the Notes.  The Additional Capped Calls have cap prices that range from $11.4000 to $13.1708 per share. The Additional Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 9.5 million shares of Common Stock.  The Capped Calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. To the extent that market value per share of Common Stock exceeds the lower strike price, Micron will be entitled to receive, at Micron's election, shares of Common Stock or, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, cash from the counterparties. If, however, the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, exceeds the applicable cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of the Common Stock exceeds the cap price. Micron paid approximately $56.8 million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. The expiration dates of the Capped Calls range from three to four-and-a-half years.  The Capped Calls are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting Micron, including a merger event; tender offer; and a nationalization, insolvency or delisting involving Micron.  In addition, the Capped Calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Calls, including changes in law; insolvency filings and hedging disruptions.
 
The summary of the foregoing transactions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Capped Calls, a form of which will be filed with Micron's next annual report on Form 10-K.
 
Item 2.03
     
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
The foregoing terms and conditions of the Notes and Indentures described in Items 1.01 and 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 3.02       Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
 
As described in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, Micron issued $690,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes to the Initial Purchasers on July 26, 2011 in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
 
Micron offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers are initially offering the Notes to "qualified institutional buyers" pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Micron relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers.
 
The Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
 
The Notes are convertible into cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, as described above.

In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action.

settlement or judgment.

The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)           The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
 
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities resold by it in the initial placement of such Securities were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(f)
                                   
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser, any person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any affiliate of any Initial Purchaser or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
9.
                                      
Termination
.  The Initial Purchasers may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State or Idaho State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and
adverse and that, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause 9, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Memorandum or the Final Memorandum.
 
10.
                                
Effectiveness; Defaulting Initial Purchasers
.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
 
If, on the Closing Date, or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Initial Purchaser.  If, on the Closing Date any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Initial Purchaser or of the Company.  In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Time of Sale Memorandum, the Final Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  If, on an Option Closing Date, any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers shall have the option to (a) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (b) purchase not less than the principal amount of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Initial Purchasers, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason
the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers or such Initial Purchasers as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
11.
                                
Entire Agreement
.  (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Initial Purchasers with respect to the preparation of the Preliminary Memorandum, the Time of Sale Memorandum, the Final Memorandum, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
 
(b)
                                
The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities:  (i) the Initial Purchasers have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Initial Purchasers owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) if any, and (iii) the Initial Purchasers may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Initial Purchasers arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.

3.
                                      
The shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Securities have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Securities by valid corporate action and are free from preemptive rights under the Company's charter or by-laws, the federal laws of the United States of America and the DGCL.

7.
                                      
None of the execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement, the Indentures, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the issuance of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities or the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated thereby will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (A) the charter or by-laws of the Company or (B) any
statute, decree, regulation or order known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company of any Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties or assets, except such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults in clause (B) above as would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to perform its obligations under the Operative Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

10.
                                
The statements set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum under the caption "Description of Notes" and "Description of Capital Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and such Capital Stock, fairly summarize such terms and documents in all material respects.
 
11.

accountants of the Company, at which conferences the contents of the Disclosure Package, the Final Offering Memorandum and related matters were reviewed and discussed and, although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum (other than as set forth in paragraphs 10 and 11 above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention, in the course of such review and discussion, that have caused it to believe that:
 
(i)
                                    
the Disclosure Package, as of 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time on July 20, 2011 (the "Applicable Time"), and on the date hereof, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data based on or derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which we express no belief), or

EXHIBIT C
 
1.
                                      
To the best of such counsel's knowledge, but without inquiring into the dockets of any court, commissions, regulatory body, administrative agency or other government body, and other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and Final Offering Memorandum, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or of which any property or assets of the Company is the subject, which such counsel believes individually or in the aggregate would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities will be free of preemptive rights under any agreement known to me.
 
3.
                                      
None of the execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement or the Indentures, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the issuance of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities or the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated thereby will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (A) any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (B) any statute, decree, regulation or order applicable to the Company of any U.S. Federal or Idaho court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties or assets, except such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's ability to perform its obligations under the Operative Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
4.

.

(a) To convert a Note that is represented by a Certificated Note, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign a Conversion Notice, a form of which is on the back of the Note, and deliver such Conversion Notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Note to the Conversion Agent, (3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsement and transfer documents, (4) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes and (5) if required, pay Cash equal to amount of interest due on the next Interest Payment Date for such Note.  If a Holder holds a beneficial interest in a Global Note, to convert such beneficial interest, such Holder must comply with requirements (4) and (5) as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and comply with the
Applicable Procedures of the Depositary for converting a beneficial interest in a Global Note.  The first date on which all of the requirements set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.02(a) (in the case of a Certificated Note) or the second sentence of this Section 10.02(a) (in the case of a Global Note or a beneficial interest therein) have been satisfied is referred to in this Indenture as the "."

(c)
          
A Holder receiving Common Stock upon conversion shall not be entitled to any rights as a holder of Common Stock, including, among other things, the right to vote and receive dividends and notices of stockholder meetings, until the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Observation Period.

Upon conversion of a Note, a Holder will not receive, except as described below, any Cash payment representing accrued interest (including any Additional Interest), other than the Make-Whole Premium pursuant to Section 11.01.  Instead, accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) will be deemed paid by the Cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, received by the Holder upon conversion.  Delivery to the Holder of such Cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, shall thus be deemed to satisfy (1) the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of a Note, and (2) the Company's obligation to pay any accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Note from the last Interest Payment Date to the Conversion Date.  As a result, upon conversion of a Note, accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Note to, but not including, the Conversion Date is deemed paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.
 
(e)
          
Notwithstanding Section 10.02(d), if Notes are converted after a Regular Record Date but prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, Holders of such Notes at the Close of Business on such Regular Record Date will receive the interest payable (including Additional Interest) on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion.  Such Notes, upon surrender for conversion, must be accompanied by Cash equal to the amount of interest (including any Additional Interest) payable on such Interest Payment Date on the Notes so converted; that no such payment need be made (1) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, (3) with respect to any Notes converted after the Regular Record Date immediately preceding August 1, 2018 or (4) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest that exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.

(d)
          
With respect to any conversion of Notes, subject to subsection (c) of this Section 10.03, the Company may irrevocably elect to settle all or a portion of the remainder, if any, of its Conversion Obligation in excess of the aggregate principal portion of the Notes being converted in Cash by informing the Trustee, converting Holders, through the Trustee, and the Depositary of such election no later than the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date (or, in the case of any conversions occurring on or after the 24th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, no later than the 24th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date), and the Company shall indicate in such notice the percentage of the remainder, if any, of the Company's Conversion Obligation in excess of the aggregate principal portion of the Notes being converted that will be paid in Cash (the "").

The Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) shall have no responsibility for any such determination.
 
Section 10.04.
     
Fractional Shares
.  The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of a Note.  Instead, the Company shall pay Cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Closing Price of Common Stock on the last Trading Day of the relevant Observation Period.
 
Section 10.05.
     
Taxes on Conversion
.  If a Holder converts a Note, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion.  However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name.  The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because Common Stock is to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name.
 
Section 10.06.
     
Company to Provide Common Stock
.  The Company shall, from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the delivery in respect of all outstanding Notes of the number of shares of Common Stock due upon conversion.
 
All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.

In addition, if any shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares of Common Stock may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will cause such shares of Common Stock to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be.
 
Section 10.07.
     
Adjustment to Conversion Rate
 
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, at any time and from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, by the Company if any of the following events occur.
(a)
          
If the Company issues dividends or makes distributions on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or if the Company subdivides, combines or reclassifies shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
where,
 
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 10.07(a) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the opening of business on the effective date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.07(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided, combined or reclassified, as the case may be, effective as of the date the Board of Directors or a committee thereof determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such subdivision, combination or reclassification, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution or subdivision, combination or reclassification had not been declared.
 
(b)
          
If the Company distributes to all holders of shares of Common Stock rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, that such rights plan provides for the issuance of such rights with respect to the Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes) to purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution at less than the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the public announcement of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
provided
 
where,
 
 
Any increase made under this Section 10.07(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution. However, to the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred.  In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the relevant distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, options or warrants and the value of such consideration if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.  Except in connection with any readjustment expressly provided for in this clause, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07(b).
 
(c)
          
If the Company distributes to all holders of shares of Common Stock, any of its Capital Stock, assets (including shares of any Subsidiary of the Company or business unit of the Company) or debt securities or certain rights to purchase securities of the Company (excluding (i) any dividends or distributions described in Section 10.07(a), (ii) any rights,
options or warrants described in Section 10.07(b), (iii) any dividends or other distributions described in Section 10.07(d) and (iv) the initial distribution of rights issued pursuant to a stockholder rights plan; that such rights plan provides for the issuance of such rights with respect to the Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes) (such Capital Stock, assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company hereinafter in this Section 10.07(c) called the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
provided
Distributed Assets
 
 
where,
 
 
Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution; that if "FMV" (as defined in this Section 10.07(c)) is equal to or greater than "CMP
provided
0
" (as defined in this Section 10.07(c)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall receive on the date on which the Distributed Assets are distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, the amount of Distributed Assets such Holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such distribution.  In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
 
If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.07(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "") used in computing the Current Market Price for purposes of the definition of "CMP
Reference Period

" in this Section 10.07(c), unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the fair market value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holders.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.07(c), if the Company distributes Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company
or business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
 
where,
 
 
Any adjustment pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be determined on the last Trading Day of such ten consecutive Trading Day period but shall be given effect immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off.  In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07(c).
 
(d)           If the Company distributes dividends or makes other distributions paid entirely in Cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, other than (i) distributions described in Section 10.07(e) or (ii) any dividend or distribution in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where,
 
 
Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution or dividend; that if "C" (as defined in this Section 10.07(d)) is equal to or greater than "CMP
provided
0
" (as defined in this Section 10.07(d)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive on the date on which the relevant Cash dividend or distribution is distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of Cash such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such dividend or distribution.  In the event that such distribution or dividend is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  Except in connection with any readjustment expressly provided for in the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07(d).
 
(e)           If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries distribute Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, where such Cash and the value of any such other consideration per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately following the last date (such last date, the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
 
where,
 
 
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.07(e) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.  In the event that the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.  Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 10.07(e) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 10.07(e).
 
Section 10.08.      Provisions Governing Adjustment to Conversion Rate
.  Rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 10.07 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.07 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under Section 10.07(c), and, if applicable, Section 10.20.

In addition, except as set forth in Section 10.20, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.07 was made (including any adjustment contemplated in Section 10.20), (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or

Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the Participant account to be credited with such increase.
 
(iii)  A beneficial interest in any Transfer Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Transfer Restricted Global Note if the transfer complies with the requirements of Section 2.13(c)(ii) and the Registrar receives a duly executed certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto.
 
(iv)  A beneficial interest in any Transfer Restricted Global Note may be exchanged for a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Note or transferred to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Note if (1) the exchange or transfer complies with the requirements of Section 2.13(c)(ii) and (2) if the Registrar so requests or if the Applicable Procedures so require, an Opinion of Counsel in form reasonably acceptable to the Registrar to the effect that such exchange or transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act and that the restrictions on transfer contained herein and in the Transfer Restricted Note Legend are no longer required in order to maintain compliance with the Securities Act.

(e)           As used in Section 2.13(c) and (d), the term "transfer" encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer, hypothecation or other disposition of any Note.
 
(f)            This Section 2.13(f) shall apply only to Global Notes:

Any Global Note to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar.  With regard to any Global Note to be exchanged in part, either such Global Note shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Note, the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee.  Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Note issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof.
 
(iii)  Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Notes.

(v)   Neither Agent Members nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Note registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Note, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Note.

If a Holder holds a beneficial interest in a Global Note, to convert such beneficial interest, such Holder must comply with requirements (4) and (5) as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and comply with the
 
Applicable Procedures of the Depositary for converting a beneficial interest in a Global Note.  The first date on which all of the requirements set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.02(a) (in the case of a Certificated Note) or the second sentence of this Section 10.02(a) (in the case of a Global Note or a beneficial interest therein) have been satisfied is referred to in this Indenture as the "."

Instead, accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) will be deemed paid by the Cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, received by the Holder upon conversion.  Delivery to the Holder of such Cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, shall thus be deemed to satisfy (1) the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of a Note, and (2) the Company's obligation to pay any accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Note from the last Interest Payment Date to the Conversion Date.  As a result, upon conversion of a Note, accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Note to, but not including, the Conversion Date is deemed paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.

Taxes on Conversion
.  If a Holder converts a Note, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion.  However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name.

(a)
          
If the Company issues dividends or makes distributions on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or if the Company subdivides, combines or reclassifies shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

Any adjustment made under this Section 10.07(a) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the opening of business on the effective date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.07(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided, combined or reclassified, as the case may be, effective as of the date the Board of Directors or a committee thereof determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such subdivision, combination or reclassification, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution or subdivision, combination or reclassification had not been declared.

Any increase made under this Section 10.07(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution. However, to the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred.  In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the relevant distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, options or warrants and the value of such consideration if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.  Except in connection with any readjustment expressly provided for in this clause, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07(b).
 
(c)
          
If the Company distributes to all holders of shares of Common Stock, any of its Capital Stock, assets (including shares of any Subsidiary of the Company or business unit of the Company) or debt securities or certain rights to purchase securities of the Company (excluding (i) any dividends or distributions described in Section 10.07(a), (ii) any rights,
options or warrants described in Section 10.07(b), (iii) any dividends or other distributions described in Section 10.07(d) and (iv) the initial distribution of rights issued pursuant to a stockholder rights plan; that such rights plan provides for the issuance of such rights with respect to the Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes) (such Capital Stock, assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company hereinafter in this Section 10.07(c) called the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
provided
Distributed Assets

" (as defined in this Section 10.07(c)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall receive on the date on which the Distributed Assets are distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, the amount of Distributed Assets such Holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such distribution.  In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
 
If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.07(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "") used in computing the Current Market Price for purposes of the definition of "CMP

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.07(c), if the Company distributes Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company
or business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
 
where,
 
 
Any adjustment pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be determined on the last Trading Day of such ten consecutive Trading Day period but shall be given effect immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off.  In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07(c).
 
(d)
          
If the Company distributes dividends or makes other distributions paid entirely in Cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, other than (i) distributions described in Section 10.07(e) or (ii) any dividend or distribution in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:

In the event that such distribution or dividend is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  Except in connection with any readjustment expressly provided for in the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07(d).
 
(e)           If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries distribute Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, where such Cash and the value of any such other consideration per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately following the last date (such last date, the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
 
where,
 
 
 
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.07(e) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.  In the event that the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.  Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 10.07(e) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 10.07(e).
 
Section 10.08.      Provisions Governing Adjustment to Conversion Rate
.  Rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 10.07 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.07 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under Section 10.07(c), and, if applicable, Section 10.20.  If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof), except as set forth in Section 10.20.  In addition, except as set forth in Section 10.20, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.07 was made (including any adjustment contemplated in Section 10.20), (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or
Trigger Event
repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.

(c)
                                 
sale or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;
 
in each case as a result of which Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, or would constitute solely the right to receive, stock, other securities or other property or assets (including Cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a ""), then, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the Company, or such successor, purchaser or transferee Person, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture permitted under Section 9.02(b) to provide that the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Notes into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including Cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately before such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive (the ) upon such Merger Event; , , that at and after the effective time of the Merger Event, (i) the amount otherwise payable in Cash upon conversion of the Notes as set forth under Section 10.03 above shall continue to be payable in Cash, (ii) the Company shall continue to have the right to determine the form of consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its Conversion Obligation in excess of the aggregate principal portion of the Notes being converted, as set forth under Section 10.03, (iii) each share of Common Stock that would otherwise have been required to be delivered upon a conversion of the Notes as set forth under Section 10.03 shall instead be deliverable in the amount and type of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock would have been entitled to receive in such Merger Event (a "") and (iv) the Daily VWAP shall be calculated based on the value of one unit of Reference Property.

If the Merger Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, or constitute solely the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), then (x) the Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible or used to calculate the Daily VWAP, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election and (y) the unit of Reference Property for purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph shall refer to the consideration referred to in clause (x) attributable to one share of Common Stock.  The Company shall notify
Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
 
If, in the case of any Disposition Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a Person other than the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article 3 herein.
 
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 10.09, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of Cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Disposition Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders.  The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Register provided for in this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.  The Company shall not become a party to any such Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 10.09.

.  (a) If, after the date hereof, a Change in Control (determined after giving effect to any exceptions or exclusions to such definition, but without regard to the in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, a "") occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Change in Control, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the Applicable Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described in this Section 10.10.  A conversion of Notes will be deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" a Make-Whole Change in Control if the notice of conversion of the Notes is received by the Conversion Agent from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Change in Control up to, and including, the Business Day immediately prior to the related Repurchase Date (or, in the case of an event that would have been a Change in Control but for the in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the 35th Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Change in Control).

(b)
                                
The number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date that such Make-Whole Change in Control transaction
becomes effective (the "") and the price paid per share of Common Stock in the Make-Whole Change in Control (in the case of a Make-Whole Change in Control described in clause (ii) of the definition of Change in Control in which holders of Common Stock receive only Cash), or in the case of any other Make-Whole Change in Control, the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Change in Control (the "").

(c)           The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Applicable Conversion Rate is adjusted.  The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices immediately prior to such adjustment, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment, and the denominator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  In addition, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Applicable Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.07.

The following table sets forth the Stock Price, Effective Date and number of Make-Whole Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes:
 
 
(d)           If the exact Stock Price and Effective Date is not set forth in the table, then (i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Notes will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and/or the earlier and later Effective Dates in the table, as applicable, based on a 365-day year, (ii) if the Stock Price is in excess of $30.00 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.10(c)), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes; and (iii) if the Stock Price is less than $7.60 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.10(c)), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes.
 
(e)           To the extent permitted by applicable law and the listing rules of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 10.07, as the Board of Directors considers to be
advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.

Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to the contrary, in the event of any increase in the Conversion Rate that which would result in the Notes, in the aggregate and taken together with the 2031A Notes (as defined in the Offering Memorandum), becoming convertible into shares of Common Stock in excess of the share issuance limitations of the listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market or the principal U.S. securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, the Company shall, at its option, either obtain stockholder approval of such issuances or deliver Cash in lieu of any shares otherwise deliverable upon conversions in excess of such limitations (calculated based on the Daily VWAP on the last Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period).
 
Section 10.11.      When Adjustment May Be Deferred
.  No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate.  Any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate will be carried forward and taken into account in determining any subsequent adjustment.  In addition, the Company shall make any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected on each anniversary of the date hereof, upon conversion of any Note (but only with respect to such converted Note), upon required repurchases of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.01, and on the Scheduled Trading Day prior to the Maturity Date.
 
Section 10.12.      When No Adjustment Required
.  (a) No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 10.07 if Holders participate, without conversion, in the transaction or event that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to such Section at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event as if Holders, at such time, held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Applicable Conversion Rate, the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder, without having to convert their Notes.

Section 10.13.      Notice of Adjustment
.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly send to Holders a written notice of the adjustment.  The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and a certificate from the Company's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it.

Section 10.17.      Trustee's Adjustment Disclaimer
.  The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article 10 should be made, how it should be made or what it should be.  The Trustee has no duty to determine whether a supplemental indenture under Section 10.12 need be entered into or whether any provisions of any supplemental indenture are correct.
