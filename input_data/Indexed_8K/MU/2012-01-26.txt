RESOLVED, that Article II, Section 10 of the Bylaws of this Company be amended to read as follows:
SECTION 10.  At all elections of directors of the corporation each stockholder having voting power shall be entitled to exercise the right of cumulative voting as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.

If any stockholder has given such notice, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for candidates in nomination.
RESOLVED FURTHER, that Article II of the Bylaws of this Company be amended to add Section 12, which will read in its entirety as follows:
SECTION  12.  Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominees and Stockholder Business
(a)  To be properly brought before  an annual meeting or  special meeting, nominations for the election of directors or other business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
(b)  For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date specified in the corporation's proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous  year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was  held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i)  a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting  such business at the annual meeting,  (ii) the name and address, as they  appear on  the  corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of  the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv)  any  material interest of the stockholder in such business and  (v) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under  the securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholders' meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12. The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12, and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
 
 
(c)   Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors  of the  corporation  may  be  made  at  a meeting of stockholders by or  at  the direction of the Board of Directors or by  any stockholder of the corporation entitled to  vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with  the notice procedures set  forth in    this paragraph (c).  Such nominations, other than those made by or  at  the direction of the Board  of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely   notice  in  writing  to the Secretary   of   the  corporation in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph  (b)  of  this  Section  12. Such  stockholder's notice  shall  set forth  (i) as to each person, if  any, whom   the stockholder  proposes to nominate  for election or  re-election as  a  director:  (A) the  name,  age, business address and residence address of such  person,  (B)  the  principal occupation or  employment of  such person,  (C) the class and  number of shares  of the corporation which  are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a  description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and  each nominee and any other person or  persons  (naming  such  person or persons)   pursuant   to which the nominations  are to be  made  by  the stockholder   and   (E)   any    other information  relating to  such  person that  is  required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors,   or   is   otherwise required,  in  each case pursuant   to Regulation 14A under the Exchange  Act (including  without  limitation   such person's  written consent  to   being named in the proxy statement, if  any, as  a  nominee  and to  serving  as  a director if elected); and (ii) as to such  stockholder giving  notice,  the information  required to  be  provided pursuant  to paragraph  (b)  of  this Section  12.   At the request  of the Board   of   Directors, any   person nominated   by a   stockholder for election  as a director shall  furnish to  the  Secretary of the  corporation that  information required to  be  set forth  in the stockholder's notice  of nomination  which  pertains to the nominee.  No person shall be eligible for  election  as  a director  of  the corporation unless   nominated in accordance  with  the procedures  set forth  in  this  paragraph  (c).  The chairman of the meeting shall, if  the facts warrant, determine and  declare at  the meeting that a nomination was not made  in  accordance  with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws; and  if he should so determine,  he shall  so declare at the meeting,  and the  defective nomination  shall   be disregarded.
