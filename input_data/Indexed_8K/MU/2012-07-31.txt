such interest to the extent it accrues at a rate in excess of [*]% per annum, and (ii) the difference between any arrangement fees that would have been incurred and payable upon effectiveness of the DIP Credit Line Agreement and the actual fees incurred and payable upon the effectiveness of any such extended or replacement DIP financing facility.  At the Sponsors election, or in the event necessary to secure the extended or replacement DIP financing facility, any such extended or replacement DIP financing facility will be supported by a payment guarantee from the Sponsor or one of the Sponsors subsidiaries, provided such payment guarantee is on reasonable terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Sponsor, which will include (i) complete subrogation to the rights of the lender in the event the payment guarantee is called upon, (ii) a reimbursement agreement by the Reorganization Company in favor of the Sponsor or its applicable subsidiary with respect to amounts paid under the payment guarantee, (iii) a limited period of time following the termination of this Agreement to demand payment upon such payment guarantee after which time the payment guarantee shall terminate (excluding any subrogation rights), and (iv) other provisions as necessary or appropriate to put the Sponsor in the same position as nearly as practicable as it would have been had it extended the loans pursuant to the DIP Credit Line Agreement as contemplated on the terms and conditions set forth in the DIP Term Sheet (including, without limitation, (A) remedies if the guarantee is called upon, (B) early maturity upon termination of this Agreement or circumstances that give rise to the right of the Sponsor to terminate this Agreement, without the Closing having occurred, (C) payment of contingent interest and fees in the event of any such early maturity, (D) suspension of the availability of any new borrowings during certain challenges by creditors to the plans of reorganization, and (E) other additions or modifications to the Existing DIP Financing as summarized in the DIP Term Sheet as necessary or appropriate to put the Sponsor as nearly as practicable in the same position it would have been had it been a direct lender on the terms and conditions summarized in the DIP Term Sheet.  The governing law and language of the documentation for the extension or replacement facility (including any payment guarantee by the Sponsor or one of the Sponsors subsidiaries) will be Japanese, except to the extent a different law or language is required by the lender(s)).  The Sponsor shall make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to assist the Reorganization Company in obtaining an extension or replacement of the Existing DIP Financing for the Interim Period and, if necessary, the continuation of a portion of such financing up to 50 oku Yen for a period of up to two months following the Closing Date.
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of and prior to requesting any such Sponsor CapEx Financing, the Trustees shall cause the Reorganization Company to make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to obtain third party financing arrangements, including

secured or unsecured loans, capital leases, operating leases, sale-leaseback transactions, vendor financings or any combination thereof, on terms and conditions similar to those set forth in or contemplated by the CapEx Facility Term Sheet, as such terms and conditions may be reasonably modified to reflect terms customary for financings of that type and to obtain financing under then-prevailing applicable financing market conditions, or on terms and conditions otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Sponsor (any such financing arrangements, ).  At the Sponsors election, the proceeds of Third Party CapEx Financings shall be used to repay outstanding Sponsor CapEx Financing.  The Sponsor shall make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to assist the Reorganization Company in obtaining Third Party CapEx Financings in lieu of the Sponsor CapEx Financing.
Third Party CapEx Financings
 
With respect to any such Third Party CapEx Financings, the Sponsor will reimburse the Reorganization Company for (i) any difference between (x) the amount of interest that would have accrued and been payable for the applicable period pursuant to the terms and conditions provided for in the CapEx Facility Term Sheet and (y) the actual interest (or its equivalent) accrued and payable for the applicable period pursuant to any such Third Party CapEx Financings, provided that the Sponsor shall not be required to reimburse the Reorganization Company for any such interest to the extent it accrues at a rate in excess of [*]% per annum, and (ii) the difference between any arrangement fees that would have been incurred and payable upon the effectiveness of the Sponsor CapEx Financings and the actual fees incurred and payable upon the effectiveness of any such Third Party CapEx Financing.  At the Sponsors election, or in the event such payment guarantee is necessary in order to secure such Third Party CapEx Financings, any such Third Party CapEx Financings will be supported by a payment guarantee from the Sponsor or one of the Sponsors subsidiaries, provided such payment guarantee is on reasonable terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Sponsor, which will include, among other things, (i) complete subrogation to the rights of the lender/lessor in the event the payment guarantee is called upon, (ii) a reimbursement agreement by the Reorganization Company and/or Rexchip in favor of the Sponsor or its subsidiaries with respect to amounts paid under the payment guarantee, (iii) the grant of a perfected first priority security interest in the Reorganization Companys and its Related Companies shares of Rexchip and other unencumbered collateral owned by the Reorganization Company or its subsidiaries, to secure the reimbursement obligations under the reimbursement agreement, (iv) a limited period of time following the termination of this Agreement to demand payment upon such payment guarantee after which time the payment guarantee shall terminate (excluding any subrogation rights), and (v) other provisions as necessary or appropriate to put the Sponsor in the same position as nearly as practicable as it would have been had it provided Sponsor CapEx Financing as contemplated on the terms and conditions set forth in the CapEx Facility Term Sheet (including, without limitation, (A) remedies if the guarantee is called upon, (B) early maturity upon termination of this Agreement or circumstances that give right to the Sponsor to terminate this Agreement, without the Closing having occurred, (C) payment of contingent interest and fees in the event of any such early maturity, (D) suspension of the availability of any new borrowings (or the equivalent) during certain challenges by creditors to the plans of reorganization and (E) rights to repossess and dispose the related capital equipment and other collateral).

governing law and language of the documentation for the foregoing arrangements (including any payment guarantee by the Sponsor or one of the Sponsors subsidiaries) will be Japanese, except to the extent a different law or language is required by the lender(s), lessor(s) or other source(s) of financing (other than the Sponsor or any of its subsidiaries).
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to receipt of any required approvals from the Trustees (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the applicable Both Companies Courts, the Sponsor shall implement the transition of Both Reorganization Companies businesses to the cost plus model as promptly as practicable consistent with an orderly business transition and integration process and maintain the cost plus model as described above and make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to maintain and develop the businesses of Both Reorganization Companies based on and consistent with such model.

During the Interim Period, in making material decisions on the operation of the businesses of Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies, the Trustees shall consult and cooperate with the Sponsor in respect of such material decisions, which may include consultation and cooperation with one or more representative designees of the Sponsor (and, in each case, respecting the Sponsors intention as much as possible to a reasonable extent), except where or to the extent it is reasonably determined by the Trustees, after consultation with independent antitrust counsel, that such consultation would be a violation of applicable antitrust Laws.

In the event of any election to reduce the Optimal CapEx to the Reduced Commitment for any fiscal quarter, an amount equal to the difference between the Optimal CapEx and the Reduced Commitment for such fiscal quarter shall be added to the Reorganization Companys capital expenditure commitment for the succeeding fiscal quarter and become part of the Optimal CapEx for such succeeding fiscal quarter.

If the Trustees desire to take an action that would be prohibited without the consent of the Sponsor pursuant to this Article 12, or to refrain from taking an action where the failure to take such action requires the consent of the Sponsor pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustees may request such consent by contacting one of the designees of the Sponsor to be appointed by the Sponsor and each of whom will be identified to the Trustees in writing promptly following the Execution Date (each, a  ).  Either Sponsor Designee may grant consent on behalf of the Sponsor to the taking of any action which would otherwise be prohibited, or to the failing to take any action that would otherwise be required, pursuant to this Article 12, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Trustees take any action or cause any action to be taken that otherwise would be prohibited by the provisions of Article 12.2 or 12.3 without the consent of the Sponsor (such consent not to have been unreasonably withheld or delayed), or omit to take an action or omit to cause an action to be taken that would otherwise be required by the provisions of Article 12.2 other than any action or omission to act with respect to which consent was not required to be obtained as a result of the operation of Article 12.3(y), such action or omission shall give rise to a deemed failure of a condition precedent under Article 20.1(2) to the Sponsors obligation to close and the right of the Sponsor to cancel this Agreement under Article 25.1(1), to the extent the Sponsor reasonably determines that such action or omission has, individually or in the aggregate with other such acts or omissions, materially and adversely affected the business (including relationships with customers, suppliers, lenders, joint venture and other strategic partners), operations, properties, financial condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies, taken as a whole, or the value of any of the foregoing to the Sponsor.

Upon the Closing Date, the Trustees shall cause the Reorganization Company to take the following actions in the following order: (i) acquire and cancel all of the outstanding shares and share acquisition rights as provided for in Item (2) above, (ii) make such reduction of all capital as provided for in Item (3) above, and (iii) issue such shares as provided for in Item (1) above to the Sponsor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Trustees shall set forth in the Reorganization Plan Proposal and Akita Reorganization Plan Proposal, as applicable, that the Reorganization Company shall provide, as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than three (3) Business Days, following the Closing Date the Akita Reorganization Company, by way of a subscription for shares or a loan (as determined

by Sponsor), the funds necessary for the Closing Payment for the Akita Reorganization Claims and the Akita Specified Common Benefit Claims promptly after the Closing; and the Trustees shall wire transfer such funds, as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than three (3) Business Days, following the Closing Date from the Trustees Account to the Akita Trustees Account. The same procedures will be applied with respect to the funds for the Installment Payments allocated to Akita Reorganization Claims and Akita Specified Common Benefit Claims pursuant Akita Reorganization Plan.
 
 
 
The Closing Payment Amount will be paid over time following the Closing to satisfy the Both Companies Specified Common Benefit Claims and, on the Closing Payment Date to satisfy Both Companies Reorganization Claims in accordance with Both Companies Reorganization Plans.  The Trustees shall pay the Closing Payment from Both Companies Trustees Accounts to satisfy such claims as and when applicable.  The Sponsor acknowledges that portions of the Closing Payment Amount may be retained in the Trustees Account and paid out in accordance with Both Companies Reorganization Plans.

The Sponsor acknowledges that portions of the foregoing Installment Payments may be retained in the Trustees Account and paid out in accordance with Both Companies Reorganization Plans.
 
The Installment Payments may be prepaid, at the Sponsors election, at any time without penalty whatsoever or any other similar payment. The terms and conditions of any partial prepayment (including allocation among secured and unsecured installment payments and

[*] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.
 
among scheduled installment payments) shall be determined upon consultation and agreement between the Trustees and the Sponsor, and such terms and conditions of partial prepayment shall be provided for as set forth in Article 12.1 in the Both Companies Reorganization Plan Proposals to the extent necessary to be provided for in the reorganization plan; provided, such terms and conditions shall provide that any prepayments, unless applicable Laws requires that they be applied equally in satisfaction of Installment Payments in respect of all classes of Both Companies Reorganization Claims, will be applied in satisfaction of Installment Payments in respect of secured Both Companies Reorganization Claims before Installment Payments in respect of unsecured Both Companies Reorganization Claims and, with regard to prepayments of Installment Payments in respect of the same class of claims (or all classes, if required by applicable Laws), will be applied in satisfaction of unpaid earliest-in-time Installment Payments (or portion thereof for which funds are available) first.
 
Some or all of the Installment Payments with respect to secured Both Companies Reorganization Claims may be secured by the same collateral (property, plant and equipment) securing bank debt or the subject of capitalized leases as the date of the orders of commencement of Both Companies Reorganization Proceedings, and any addition to or amendment of such security interest will not be made unless a conversion of security interest is made upon prior consent of the Sponsor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

In addition, the Sponsor and the Trustees acknowledge that in the operation of the businesses of Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies, the Business Trustee will need to cause Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies to implement a wide variety of acts, including in the areas set forth on Attachment 17.8A hereto, and that it is the intent of the Sponsor and the Trustees to provide the greatest flexibility possible in the exercise of business judgment by the Business Trustee with respect to such matters consistent with the need of the Trustee and Both Reorganization Courts to exercise appropriate controls and oversight to ensure execution of Both Companies Reorganization Plans.  In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Trustees agree to seek and make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to obtain an amendment to Section 7 of the orders of commencement of the Both Companies Corporate Reorganization Cases by Both Companies Courts entered on March 23, 2012 in the form attached hereto as Attachment 17.8B as such Attachment may be modified from time to time at the direction of Both Companies Courts following consultation among the Trustees, Both Companies Courts and the Sponsor (which consultations shall continue following the Closing Date with a view towards providing appropriate flexibility for the operation of Both Reorganization Companies businesses) (and with corresponding amendments to, and consultation with respect to, the order of commencement of the Akita Reorganization Companys Reorganization Case).
 
The Trustees agree that the categories of actions that are the subject of Section 7 of the orders of commencement of the Both Companies Corporate Reorganization Cases by Both Companies Courts entered on March 23, 2012, as the same may be amended from time to time, which do not require Both Reorganization Courts approval (due to an exclusion or other exception contained in such orders) shall not require consent from the Trustee.
 
Following the Closing, it is expected that the businesses of Both Reorganization Companies will require ongoing substantial levels of capital expenditures and that such expenditures will require the use of a substantial portion of Both Reorganization Companies available cash including existing cash balances, the proceeds from borrowings available under the Sponsor CapEx Financing or Third Party CapEx Financing and cash flow from operations.  These ongoing investments are essential to preserve the viability and cost-competitiveness of the businesses and to insure the ability of the businesses to generate cash flows under the cost plus model sufficient to provide for the later scheduled Installment Payments.
