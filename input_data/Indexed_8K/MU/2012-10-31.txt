After the appointment of the Business Trustee,
 
(1)
                      
the Trustee shall make decisions for Both Reorganization Companies in relation to acts that need to be carried out in relation to Both Companies' Reorganization Proceedings (including the filing of a petition for an order of completion of Both Companies' Reorganization Proceedings and any other matters whatsoever relating to carrying out reorganization proceedings) and

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, after the appointment of the Business Trustee, the Sponsor acknowledges that the Business Trustee has a duty to consult with the Trustee within a reasonable period before executing any such matter with respect to decisions in relation to the operation of business of Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies provided for in Item (2) of the preceding paragraph to the extent such decisions are reasonably expected to have a material and adverse impact on the execution of Both Companies' Reorganization Plans.

Notwithstanding Paragraph 2, after the Business Trustee has been appointed, the Trustee shall make the decisions for Both Reorganization Companies provided for in Paragraph 2(1) upon consultation with the Sponsor and the Business Trustee within a reasonable period before executing any such matter; provided that in preparing and submitting proposals for amendments to Both Companies' Reorganization Plans, the Trustee shall do so only after prior agreement with the Sponsor on their details if such amendment would have a significant effect on Both Reorganization Companies or the Sponsor.
 
5
                              
The Sponsor acknowledges that the Business Trustee has a duty:
 
(1)
                      
to sufficiently understand this Agreement and that the Business Trustee is bound to this Agreement and cannot engage in any act that would be contrary to the spirit of this Agreement; and
 
(2)
                      
except as provided in Article 17.8 below, with respect to (i) matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies, taken as a whole, and (ii) transfer to a third party of material assets of Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies, to the extent such matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of Both Companies' Reorganization Plans, to obtain the consent of the Trustee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before carrying out any such matter or transfer.
 
6
                              
The Sponsor shall make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to carry out comprehensive supervision so that the Business Trustee shall not perform its duties in violation of Law or the spirit of this Agreement (including, without limitation, act in a manner that infringes the powers of the Trustee (which includes both Reorganization Companies) under Law or this Agreement, act in a manner that exceeds or abuses the
Business Trustee's powers under Law or this Agreement, and act without the consent from the Trustee provided for in the preceding paragraph) and shall not perform its duties in a significantly unreasonable way.
 
7
                             
The Business Trustee is not to receive any remuneration from Both Reorganization Companies for services in his or her capacity as the Business Trustee.
 
8
                              
The Sponsor and the Trustees acknowledge that the transition of each of the Both Reorganization Companies' businesses to the cost plus model will involve the implementation of a number of reasonable acts, including those summarized on Attachment 7-2 hereto, which reasonable acts are hereby approved by the Trustees.
 
In addition, the Sponsor and the Trustees acknowledge that in the operation of the businesses of Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies, the Business Trustee will need to cause Both Reorganization Companies and their Related Companies to implement a wide variety of acts, including in the areas set forth on Attachment 17.8A hereto, and that it is the intent of the Sponsor and the Trustees to provide the greatest flexibility possible in the exercise of business judgment by the Business Trustee with respect to such matters consistent with the need of the Trustee and Both Reorganization Courts to exercise appropriate controls and oversight to ensure execution of Both Companies' Reorganization Plans.  In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Trustees agree to seek and make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent to obtain an amendment to Section 7 of the orders of commencement of the Both Companies' Corporate Reorganization Cases by Both Companies' Courts entered on March 23, 2012 in the form attached hereto as Attachment 17.8B as such Attachment may be modified from time to time at the direction of Both Companies' Courts following consultation among the Trustees, Both Companies' Courts and the Sponsor (which consultations shall continue following the Closing Date with a view towards providing appropriate flexibility for the operation of Both Reorganization Companies' businesses) (and with corresponding amendments to, and consultation with respect to, the order of commencement of the Akita Reorganization Company's Reorganization Case).
 
The Trustees agree that the categories of actions that are the subject of Section 7 of the orders of commencement of the Both Companies' Corporate Reorganization Cases by Both Companies' Courts entered on March 23, 2012, as the same may be amended from time to time, which do not require Both Reorganization Courts' approval (due to an exclusion or other exception contained in such orders) shall not require consent from the Trustee.
 
Following the Closing, it is expected that the businesses of Both Reorganization Companies will require ongoing substantial levels of capital expenditures and that such expenditures will require the use of a substantial portion of Both Reorganization Companies' available cash including existing cash balances, the proceeds from borrowings available under the Sponsor CapEx Financing or Third Party CapEx Financing and cash flow from operations.  These ongoing investments are essential to preserve the viability and cost-competitiveness of the businesses and to insure the ability of the businesses to generate cash flows under the cost plus model sufficient to provide for the later scheduled Installment Payments.  At the same time, Both Reorganization Companies' businesses must be managed to provide for Installment Payments.  In making determinations as to the appropriate levels of capital
expenditures for the businesses in light of these competing considerations, the Sponsor and the Trustee acknowledge that it will be necessary and appropriate to monitor such items as cash balances, capital expenditure commitments, available funding (third-party or otherwise) and projected cash flows, relative to requirements for upcoming scheduled Installment Payments, and that in circumstances creating uncertainty regarding Both Reorganization Companies' ability to fund the upcoming Installment Payment, the Trustee or Both Companies' Courts may request appropriate limitations on such capital expenditures.
 
9 The Trustees acknowledge that the Business Trustee and Both Reorganization Companies shall make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent in achieving the goals of: (x) having minimum consolidated cash and cash equivalents (excluding Rexchip) of 700 oku Yen, and (y) [*].

Confidential Draft of 22 June 2012 For Discussion Purposes Only
 
Important General Notes:
 
1.
             
This Term Sheet was originally prepared to summarize the terms on which Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron") would commit that Micron or a direct or indirect subsidiary of Micron would provide financing for eligible capital expenditures to Elpida Memory, Inc. ("Elpida") and to support eligible capital expenditures of Rexchip Electronics Corporation (the "Sponsor CapEx Financing"), which financing may be in the various forms contemplated by this Term Sheet.
 
2.
             
As described in the Sponsor Agreement, the parties have agreed that instead of Micron providing such financing, the Trustees shall cause Elpida to make efforts as much as possible to obtain third party financing arrangements, including secured or unsecured loans, capital leases, operating leases, sale-leasebacks, vendor financing or any combination thereof, on terms and conditions similar to those set forth in or contemplated by this Term Sheet (including the Cash Condition defined below in the Term Sheet), as such terms and conditions may be reasonably modified to reflect terms customary for financings of that type and to obtain financing under then-prevailing applicable financing market conditions
,
or on terms and conditions otherwise reasonably acceptable to Micron (any such financing arrangements, "Third Party CapEx Financings").  Micron has agreed in the Sponsor Agreement that it shall make efforts as much as possible to a reasonable extent
to assist Elpida in obtaining Third Party CapEx Financings in lieu of the Sponsor CapEx Financing.
 
3.
             
The parties have also agreed that with respect to any such Third Party CapEx Financings, Micron will reimburse Elpida for (i) any difference between (x) the amount of interest that would have accrued and been payable for the applicable period pursuant to the terms and conditions provided for in this Term Sheet and (y) the actual interest (or its equivalent) accrued and payable for the applicable period pursuant to any such Third Party CapEx Financings, provided that Micron shall not be required to reimburse Elpida for any such interest to the extent it accrues at a rate in excess of [*]% per annum, and (ii) the difference between any arrangement fees that would have been incurred and

payable upon the effectiveness of the Sponsor CapEx Financings and the actual fees incurred and payable upon the effectiveness of any such Third Party CapEx Financing.
 
In addition, with respect to Third Party CapEx Financings, Micron shall make efforts as much as possible to a commercially reasonable extent to arrange for maturities and amortization schedules matching as nearly as practicable the remaining useful lives and corresponding depreciation schedules of financed equipment, subject to a maximum of [*] months amortization.
 
4.
             
At Micron's election or in the event such payment guarantee is necessary in order to secure such Third Party CapEx Financings, any such
Third Party CapEx Financings will be supported by a payment guarantee from Micron or one of its subsidiaries, provided such payment guarantee is on reasonable terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Sponsor, which will include (i) complete subrogation to the rights of the lender/lessor in the event the payment guarantee is called upon, (ii) a reimbursement agreement by Elpida and/or Rexchip in favor of Micron or its subsidiaries with respect to amounts paid under the payment guarantee, (iii) the grant of a perfected first priority security interest in Rexchip's shares and other unencumbered collateral owned by Elpida or its subsidiaries, to secure the reimbursement obligations under the reimbursement agreement, (iv) a limited period of time following the termination of the Sponsor Agreement to demand payment upon such payment guarantee, after which time the payment guarantee shall terminate (excluding any subrogation rights), and (v) other provisions as necessary or appropriate to put Micron as nearly as practicable in the same position as it would have been had it provided Sponsor CapEx Financing as contemplated on the terms and conditions set forth in this Term Sheet (including, without limitation, (A) remedies if guarantee is called upon, (B) early maturity upon termination of the Sponsor Agreement, or circumstances that give rise to the right of Micron to terminate the Sponsor Agreement, without the Closing having occurred, (C) payment of contingent interest and fees in the event of any such early maturity, (D) suspension of the availability of any new borrowings (or the equivalent) during certain challenges by creditors to the plans of reorganization, and (E) rights to repossess and dispose the related capital equipment and other collateral).  The governing law and language of the documentation for any Third Party CapEx Financing (including any Micron payment guarantee) will be Japanese, except to the extent a different law or language is required by the lender(s), lessor(s) or other source(s) of financing (other than Micron or any of its subsidiaries).
 
5.
             
This Term Sheet is included as an attachment to the Sponsor Agreement solely for the purpose of applying the provisions of the foregoing Notes.  However, if Third Party

CapEx Financing is not available within a reasonable period of time, taking into account the amount of the requested financing and then prevailing financing market conditions, prior to when the Borrower is scheduled to make any capital expenditures after Elpida and Micron using their efforts to obtain such financing as contemplated by the Sponsor Agreement, Micron shall provide Sponsor CapEx Financing to Elpida as contemplated by the Sponsor Agreement, however, the form of any such Sponsor CapEx Financing ( secured loan, capital lease, operating lease, sale-leaseback or any combination thereof) shall be at the election of Micron and shall be subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documents therefor in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Micron.

Applicable margins will be set within the approximate 5-10% range (with some potential for a higher margin) based on applicable tax consideration.  Exact margins can only be fixed after final determination of cost basis of the property, plant and equipment as well as the remaining useful life of the assets, and taking into consideration required cash flows to support anticipated capital expenditures and Installment Payments.
                             
To the extent consistent with applicable tax Laws and regulations, the Sponsor will review with the Trustee applicable margins periodically to confirm that the margins are appropriate for the businesses, and evaluate the need to reset such margins (within the approximate 5-10% range).
                             
References herein to the term "margin" or "margins" in this Attachment 7-1 mean "mark-up".
 
Illustrative Example of Determining Cost Plus for the Reorganization Company
 
A three step process is used to aggregate the legal entity spending and to charge out the cost to the appropriate Sponsor legal entities:
 
                 
Step 1:  Aggregate costs by category for (i) manufacturing costs and other cost of sales, (ii) general and administrative expenses and (iii) non-operating expenses or income and extraordinary loss or gain, and (iv) aggregate research and development costs.
 
                 
Step 2:  Set margin applicable to each category of costs per the intercompany transfer price cost structure.  Exact margin can only be fixed after final determination of cost basis of the property, plant and equipment as well as the remaining useful life of the assets.  Once the cost basis is determined, the margin will be fixed at a level taking into consideration required cash flows to support anticipated capital expenditures and Installment Payments.
 
                 
Step 3:  Charge Sponsor (Singapore subsidiary) for the costs of goods manufactured for sale ((i), (ii) and (iii) as provided above) by taking the total and dividing it by the number of wafers shipped.  Research and development costs are aggregated and charged directly to Sponsor on a monthly basis.
 
The three step process is illustrated below, assuming a total base cost of 100 for purposes of illustration only:
