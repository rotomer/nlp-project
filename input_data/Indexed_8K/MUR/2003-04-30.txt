Exhibit 99.1
 
 
EL DORADO, Arkansas, April 30, 2003  Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) announced today that income before a required accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 was $94.1 million, $1.02 per diluted share, compared to income of $2.3 million, $.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2002. The current period includes a $20.1 million gain related to resolution of prior years' income tax matters, which increased the Company's income by $.22 per share. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this new standard, the Company recorded a cumulative, one-time, non-cash reduction of net income of $7 million, $.08 per share. The Company's income excluding the tax gain and the accounting change was $74 million, $.80 per share.
 
Murphy's income from exploration and production operations was $86.9 million in the first quarter of 2003 compared to $20.5 million in the same quarter of 2002. Higher sales prices for crude oil and natural gas and lower exploration expenses in Canada and Malaysia were the primary reasons for improved earnings. The Company's worldwide crude oil and condensate sales prices averaged $26.87 per barrel for the current quarter compared to $19.76 per barrel in the first quarter of 2002. Total crude oil and gas liquids production was 74,984 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2003 compared to 74,292 barrels per day in the 2002 quarter. North American natural gas sales prices averaged $5.60 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the most recent quarter compared to $2.28 per MCF in the same quarter of 2002. Natural gas sales volumes declined from 309 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2002 to 228 million cubic feet per day in the just completed quarter, primarily due to lower production from the Ladyfern field in western Canada and mature fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company's 2003 hedging program reduced the average worldwide crude oil sales price and North American natural gas sales price by $3.54 per barrel and $.36 per MCF, respectively.
 
The Company's refining and marketing operations incurred a loss of $3.5 million in the most recent quarter compared to a loss of $13.7 million in the 2002 quarter. The loss in the Company's North American operations was approximately one-half of the loss in the first quarter of 2002, with the primary improvement coming from stronger retail marketing margins. Refining and marketing operations in the U.K. were profitable in the first quarter of 2003 after posting a loss in the same quarter of 2002.
 
Corporate functions, excluding the aforementioned resolution of income tax matters totaling $20.1 million, reflected a loss of $9.4 million in the 2003 quarter compared to a loss of $4.5 million in the first quarter 2002. The larger loss was primarily caused by higher retirement and medical expenses and lower income tax benefits in the current period.
 
Claiborne P. Deming, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Despite weak downstream margins during much of the quarter, Murphy Oil's consolidated earnings were the best since the second quarter of 2001. High oil prices experienced in the just completed quarter have softened and with the wind-down of the war in Iraq, I do not expect to see any significant crude oil price spikes in the near-term. Natural gas prices should hold up well in the medium term, because low storage levels will make it difficult to achieve storage needs by the start of the gas-burning season in the fall. Production is expected to average 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. New production is set to come on at the West Patricia field in Malaysia in early May and Medusa should start up early in the third quarter. We are currently drilling the Cool Papa prospect in Green Canyon Block 380 (37.5%) and exploratory drilling in deepwater Malaysia could begin as early as May. We currently expect earnings in the second quarter
to be between $.50 and $.80 per share, with the wide range due to results of deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia later in the quarter. Results could vary based on commodity prices, drilling results and timing of oil sales."
