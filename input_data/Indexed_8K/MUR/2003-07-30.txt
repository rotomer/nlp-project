Exhibit 99.1
 
 
EL DORADO, Arkansas, July 30, 2003  Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) announced today that net income in the second quarter of 2003 was $79.7 million, $.86 per diluted share, compared to income of $14 million, $.15 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2002. The current period includes a $34 million after-tax gain related to sale of certain oil properties in the U.K. North Sea, partially offset by after-tax costs of $12.3 million related to a fire at the Company's Meraux, Louisiana refinery on June 10, 2003. The pretax refinery charges included $4.2 million related to deductibles and self insurance, $8.2 million for losses on crude oil that will be sold rather than processed, and $6.6 million for operating costs incurred at the refinery between June 10 and June 30. The Company's income excluding the two special items was $58 million, $.63 per share.
 
Reviewing quarterly results by type of business, the Company's income contribution from exploration and production operations was $87.7 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $28.6 million in the same quarter of 2002. Excluding the gain on sale of North Sea properties, current quarterly earnings were $53.7 million. The $25.1 million improvement in the just completed quarter was primarily due to lower exploration expense in Malaysia. Higher North American natural gas sales prices were mostly offset by lower natural gas production and lower oil sales volumes caused by the timing of shipments. The Company's worldwide crude oil and condensate sales prices averaged $23.63 per barrel for the current quarter compared to $23.86 per barrel in the second quarter of 2002. Total crude oil and gas liquids production was 82,488 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2003 compared to 78,050 barrels per day in the 2002 quarter, with the net increase primarily attributable to new production at the 85%-owned West Patricia field in shallow-water Malaysia. The first sale from West Patricia occurred in early July. North American natural gas sales prices averaged $4.67 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the most recent quarter compared to $3.03 per MCF in the same quarter of 2002. Natural gas sales volumes declined from 336 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2002 to 231 million cubic feet per day in the just completed quarter, primarily due to lower production from the Ladyfern field in western Canada and mature fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company's 2003 hedging program reduced the average second quarter worldwide crude oil sales price and North American natural gas sales price by $1.81 per barrel and $.18 per MCF, respectively.
 
The Company's refining and marketing results were a profit of $.3 million in the most recent quarter compared to a loss of $8 million in the 2002 quarter. Excluding the costs associated with the Meraux refinery, these worldwide operations earned $12.6 million in the second quarter 2003, with the improvement due to significantly better North American refining and marketing margins in the current quarter.
 
The after-tax costs of corporate functions were $8.3 million in the 2003 quarter compared to $7.6 million in the 2002 quarter. Lower income tax benefits and higher retirement plan costs were partially offset by a larger portion of interest costs being capitalized.
 
For the first six months of 2003, net income totaled $166.8 million, $1.80 per share, compared to $16.5 million, $.18 per share, for the 2002 period. Excluding special items, the Company earned $132 million, $1.43 per share. Both exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses showed a marked improvement in results in the first half of 2003. The Company's exploration and production operations earned $140.6 million, excluding special items, in the first half of 2003 compared to $49.1 million in the same
period of 2002. Higher oil and natural gas sales prices in 2003 and lower exploration expenses in Malaysia were the primary reason for better earnings in this area. Crude oil and gas liquids production for the first six months of 2003 averaged 78,740 barrels per day compared to 76,181 barrels per day in 2002. Natural gas sales were down from 323 million cubic feet per day in 2002 to 230 million cubic feet per day in 2003. Crude oil and condensate prices averaged $25.28 per barrel in the 2003 period compared to $21.87 per barrel in 2002. North American natural gas was sold for $5.12 per MCF in 2003, up from $2.68 in 2002. The Company's refining and marketing operations generated a profit of $9.1 million in 2003, excluding special items, but incurred a loss of $21.7 million in 2002. The improved current year result was based on stronger margins in both the North American and U.K. businesses. Corporate after-tax costs, excluding special items, increased from $12.1 million in 2002 to $17.7 million in 2003, primarily due to lower income tax benefits in the latter period.
 
Claiborne P. Deming, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our West Patricia field in Block SK 309, Malaysia, commenced production in May and should average about 12,500 barrels of oil per day for the remainder of the year. Based on a delay in the start-up of the Medusa field and slower than expected ramp-up of our heavy oil program in Western Canada, our current estimate of third quarter 2003 production is flat with the second quarter on a barrel equivalent basis. We have three deepwater wells drilling offshore Sabah, Malaysia, including an appraisal well in Block K (80%) and wildcats in both Blocks K and H (80%). In addition, we are drilling the Stonemaker prospect (85%) in Mississippi Canyon Block 493 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We currently expect earnings in the third quarter to be in the range of $.30 to $.80 per share, depending on the results of exploration drilling, which includes an unusually high amount of dry hole exposure of $38 million for deepwater wells in Malaysia."
