Exhibit 99.1
 
 
EL DORADO, Arkansas, October 26, 2004  Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) announced today that net income in the third quarter of 2004 was $118.7 million, $1.27 per share, compared to net income of $68.7 million, $.74 per share, in the third quarter of 2003. Net income in the current period included income from discontinued operations of $2.9 million, $.03 per share, associated with the sale of most conventional oil and gas assets in Western Canada in the second quarter 2004. Income from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2003 was $1.9 million, $.02 per share. Income from continuing operations in the 2004 third quarter was $115.8 million, $1.24 per share, compared to $66.8 million, $.72 per share, in the same period of 2003. The 2004 income from continuing operations includes a $24.6 million gain on sale of the "T" Block field in the U.K. North Sea and a dry hole on the Todak #1 exploration well in Block K, Malaysia.
 
For the nine months of 2004, net income totaled $566.8 million, $6.07 per share, compared to $235.5 million, $2.54 per share, for the 2003 period. Continuing operations earned $364.6 million, $3.90 per share, in 2004 and $222 million, $2.40 per share, in 2003. Income from discontinued operations was $202.2 million, $2.17 per share, in the nine months of 2004, while the same period in 2003 totaled $20.5 million, $.22 per share. Income from discontinued operations in 2004 includes a gain on asset sale of $169.2 million.
 
Third Quarter 2004 vs. Third Quarter 2003
 
Reviewing quarterly results by type of business, the Company's income contribution from continuing exploration and production operations was $118.6 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared to $65.6 million in the same quarter of 2003. The earnings improvement in 2004 was primarily caused by higher oil and natural gas sales prices and a $24.6 million after-tax gain on sale of the "T" Block field in the U.K. North Sea. These favorable variances were partially offset by lower natural gas sales volumes, higher exploration expenses and uninsured expenses of $2.6 million to repair damages from Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico. The 2003 third quarter included an $11.4 million income tax benefit in Malaysia and a $2.3 million after-tax charge for impairment of assets in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company's worldwide crude oil and condensate sales prices averaged $40.12 per barrel for the current quarter compared to $25.53 per barrel in the third quarter of 2003. Total crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations was 88,445 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2004 compared to 78,436 barrels per day in the 2003 quarter, with the net increase primarily attributable to production at the Medusa and Habanero fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, both of which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2003. Hurricane Ivan and other tropical storms reduced U.S. production by about 3,600 barrels of oil per day and eight million cubic feet of natural gas per day in the third quarter 2004. Crude oil sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 81,927 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2004 compared to 81,299 barrels per day in the 2003 period. Virtually no sales occurred in Ecuador in the 2004 third quarter while the Company realigns its transportation and marketing arrangements to resolve a dispute with the operator. The Company expects to make up this underlift position in Ecuador over the next several months. North American natural gas sales prices averaged $6.00 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the most recent quarter compared to $4.93 per MCF in the same quarter of 2003. Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations were 99 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter 2004 compared to 106 million cubic feet per
day in the third quarter of 2003. The decline in natural gas sales was primarily due to sale of natural gas properties in Western Canada in the second quarter 2004 and downtime for tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter 2004. Exploration expenses were $70.2 million in the 2004 quarter compared to $44.6 million in the same period of 2003, with the increase primarily due to higher dry hole costs offshore Eastern Canada and higher dry hole and seismic costs in Malaysia.
 
The Company's refining and marketing results generated a profit of $18.7 million in the most recent quarter compared to $4.9 million in the 2003 quarter. The improvement was due to significantly better margins in North America and the United Kingdom in the current quarter, and higher crude runs in the 2004 period. The Company's Meraux refinery was off-line most of the third quarter 2003 for repair of fire damages and a turnaround.
 
The after-tax costs of the corporate functions were $21.5 million in the 2004 quarter compared to $3.7 million in the 2003 quarter. Losses on foreign exchange increased net after-tax costs in the 2004 period by $8.2 million, while the 2003 period included foreign currency gains of $5.4 million, net of taxes. Higher administrative expenses were the other primary reasons for increased costs in 2004.
 
Nine Months 2004 vs. Nine Months 2003
 
Income from both the exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses improved significantly in the nine months of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. The Company's exploration and production continuing operations earned $359.6 million in the nine months of 2004 and $221.6 million in the same period of 2003. Higher oil and natural gas sales prices and sales volumes in 2004 were the primary reasons for better earnings in this business. Exploration expenses were $142.5 million in 2004 compared to $88.1 million in 2003, with the increase mostly due to higher costs for dry holes offshore Eastern Canada and Malaysia. Crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations for the nine months of 2004 averaged 93,632 barrels per day compared to 74,244 barrels per day in 2003. The higher production in 2004 was primarily attributable to start-up of the Medusa and Habanero fields in late 2003 and a full nine months of production at the West Patricia field in Malaysia. Natural gas sales from continuing operations were up from 111 million cubic feet per day in 2003 to 115 million cubic feet per day in 2004. Crude oil and condensate sales prices averaged $34.84 per barrel in the 2004 period compared to $26.00 per barrel in 2003. North American natural gas was sold for $6.04 per MCF in 2004, up from $5.37 in 2003.
 
The Company's refining and marketing operations generated a profit of $51.8 million in 2004 compared to a profit of $1.7 million in 2003. The improved current year result was based on better margins in both the North American and U.K. businesses in 2004. The 2003 U.S. results were unfavorably affected by a fire and planned turnaround at the Meraux refinery.
 
Corporate after-tax costs were $46.8 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared to $1.3 million in the 2003 period. The 2004 period included after-tax foreign exchange charges of $7.8 million, while 2003 included net foreign exchange benefits of $5.4 million. The 2003 period included a benefit on U.S. tax settlements of $20.1 million. Higher net interest and administrative expenses were also components of the increased costs in the 2004 period. The Company sold most of its conventional oil and gas assets in Western Canada in the second quarter of 2004 for cash proceeds of $582.7 million, which generated an after-tax gain in discontinued operations of $169.2 million. The operating results of these sold assets have also been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Claiborne P. Deming, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The Company continued its successful drilling activities in Malaysia in the third quarter of 2004
as an oil discovery was made at the Senangin #1 well in Block K, 8.5 miles outboard of the Kikeh field, and a natural gas discovery occurred at Pertang #1 in Block PM 311. The Todak #1 exploratory well, drilled in Block K in 5,765 feet of water, found noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbon in multiple thinly developed reservoirs and was plugged and abandoned. As the Todak structure extends over 30 miles, additional technical review is being undertaken prior to any future exploration on the structure. Drilling costs for Todak through September have been expensed in the third quarter 2004, while the drilling costs remaining to finish the well will be charged off in the fourth quarter. We purchased Canadian heavy oil properties at Seal in Northern Alberta during the third quarter of 2004. Current production from the acquired properties is about 2,750 barrels per day, and we will undertake a development drilling program in the fourth quarter. We anticipate total worldwide production in the fourth quarter of 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This production is reduced by about 10,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day while storm repairs are completed in the Gulf of Mexico. We currently expect earnings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.70 per share. Results could vary based on commodity prices, drilling results and timing of oil sales."
