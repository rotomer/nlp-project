To the extent the proposed action by consent involves the election of directors, the notice shall set forth as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to elect, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy or information statement as a potential director and to serving as a director if elected). During the 10 day period following the date of receipt of the notice required under this Section 9, the Company may require the stockholder and/or beneficial owner requesting a record date for proposed stockholder action by consent to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the validity of the request for a record date.
The board of directors shall be entitled to adopt promptly a resolution fixing the record date; provided that if the board of directors determines to so fix a record date it must adopt such resolution within 10 days after the date on which the request is received. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of the Company. Delivery made to the Company's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
 
been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(b) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Section (a), to the Company of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Company may engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. If independent inspectors are so engaged, then for the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with Section (a) represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
(c) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent delivered in accordance with Section (a), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed in Section (a).
Section 10. . The order of business at each meeting of stockholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to presenting proposals or to questions or comments on the affairs of the Company, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.
Conduct of Stockholder Meetings
Section 11. . Nothing in these bylaws shall be deemed to prohibit a stockholder from including any proposals in the Company's proxy statement to the extent such inclusion shall be required under the Exchange Act or to lessen any obligation of any stockholder to comply with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act in connection with the matters referred to in Sections 7 and 8 of this Article II; that neither the fact that business is properly brought before a meeting by a stockholder under Section 7 of this Article II nor the fact that a stockholder's nominee qualifies for nomination or election to the board of directors under Section 8 of this Article II shall obligate the Company to endorse that candidate or proposal or, except to the extent required by the Exchange Act, to provide a means to vote on that proposal or nominee on proxy cards solicited by the Company or to include information about that proposal or nominee in the Company's proxy statement.
