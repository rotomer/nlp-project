The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 5.07, "Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders."
On May 11, 2011, Murphy Oil Corporation held its 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Regarding an advisory vote by stockholders on the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation, 126,832,016 shares were voted in favor of an annual vote, 3,150,655 shares were voted in favor of a vote once each two years, and 23,210,348 shares were voted in favor of a vote once each three years.
In view of the fact that the frequency receiving the highest number of votes at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders was for an annual advisory vote on executive pay (the "say-on-pay" advisory vote), the Board of Directors of Murphy Oil Corporation determined to hold the say-on-pay advisory vote every year. A "say-on-pay" advisory vote proposal is therefore included in Murphy's proxy statement for its 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to be held on May 9, 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
