(a) if the number or principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the number or aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 8 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
 
SECTION 9. (a) The Company covenants with the Underwriters as follows:
Agreements.
(i) Prior to the filing by the Company of any amendment to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or of any prospectus supplement that shall name the Underwriters or the filing or use of any free writing prospectus, the Company will afford the Underwriters or their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the same; , , that the foregoing requirement will not apply to any of the Company's filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will promptly cause each applicable prospectus supplement and free writing prospectus to be filed with or transmitted for filing with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) or 424(c) under the Securities Act or Rule 433 under the Securities Act, respectively, or pursuant to such other rule or regulation of the Commission as then deemed appropriate by the Company. The Company will promptly advise the Underwriters of (A) the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement other than by virtue of the Company's filing any report required to be filed under the Exchange Act, (B) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement, for any amendment or supplement to the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or for any information from the Company, (C) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, and (D) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Underwritten Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as reasonably possible the withdrawal thereof.
provided
however
(ii) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Underwritten Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
 
(iii) If, at any time when a Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) relating to any Underwritten Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs or condition exists as a result of which the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, or any other applicable law, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters, by telephone or by facsimile (in either case with written confirmation from the Company by mail), to cease use and distribution of the Prospectus (and all then existing supplements thereto) and to suspend all efforts to resell the Underwritten Securities in its capacity as underwriter or dealer, as the case may be, and the Underwriters will promptly comply with the terms of such notice. The Company will forthwith prepare and cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, satisfactory in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and the Company will supply the Underwriters with one signed copy of such amended Registration Statement and as many copies of such amended or supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
(iv) The Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, as many copies of the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, each preliminary prospectus, any documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements and amendments thereto and any free writing prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
(v) The Company will, with such assistance from the Underwriters as the Company may reasonably request, endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the Blue Sky laws or other securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters shall reasonably request and will maintain such qualifications for as long as required with respect to the offer, sale, and distribution of the Securities.
(vi) From the date of the applicable Terms Agreement until the Closing Date set forth in such Terms Agreement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the
 
filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Underwritten Securities to be sold pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction.
(vii) The Company will make generally available to its security holders earnings statements that satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, covenants with the Company as follows:
(i) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) (each such communication by the Company or its agents or representatives (excluding any Underwriter) an "") other than (A) a free writing prospectus that contains no "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) that was not included (including through incorporation by reference) in the preliminary prospectus or a previously filed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (B) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule I to the applicable Terms Agreement or (C) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing, including the final pricing term sheet identified on Schedule 1 to the Terms Agreement (each such free writing prospectus referred to in clauses (A) or (C), an "").
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus
(ii) It has not and will not distribute any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus referred to in Section 9(b)(i)(A) above in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination.
(iii) It has not and will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use any free writing prospectus that contains the final terms of the Underwritten Securities unless such terms have previously been included in a free writing prospectus filed with the Commission.
(iv) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the "", which means such period of time beginning on the first date of the public offering of the Underwritten Securities and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters a prospectus relating to the Underwritten Securities is required by law to be delivered (or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Securities Act) in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities by any Underwriter or dealer).
Prospectus Delivery Period
 
(v) Notwithstanding any of the above, each of the Underwriters may use one or more term sheets relating to the Underwritten Securities containing customary information, including Bloomberg email announcement, price talk guidance, comparable bond pricing and final pricing terms, not inconsistent with the form of the final term sheet set forth in the Terms Agreement, without the prior consent of the Company, so long as such term sheet is not required to be filed as a "free writing prospectus" with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act.
SECTION 10. The Company will pay all costs, fees, and expenses arising in connection with the sale of any Underwritten Securities through the Underwriters and in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and under any Terms Agreement, including the following: (i) expenses incident to the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company, and all amendments and supplements thereto, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses incident to the registration of the Securities under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, (ii) expenses incident to the issuance and delivery of such Underwritten Securities, (iii) the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, (iv) expenses incident to the qualification of such Underwritten Securities under Blue Sky laws and other applicable state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a)(v) hereof, including related filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any survey of Blue Sky laws, (v) expenses incident to the printing and delivery to the Underwriters, in the quantities hereinabove stated, of copies of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and of the Prospectus, each preliminary prospectus, and all amendments and supplements thereto, (vi) the fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any applicable filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (vii) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of any Underwritten Securities on the NYSE, (viii) the fees and expenses associated with obtaining ratings for the Securities from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and (ix) if applicable, the fees and expenses of the trustee under the applicable Indenture.

Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the Company, against delivery to the Underwriters for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by them. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representatives, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Underwritten Securities which it has severally agreed to purchase. The Representatives, individually and not as representatives of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 12. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which such Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act becomes subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Company agrees to reimburse each such
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
indemnified party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; , , that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission of a material fact or allegedly untrue statement or omission of a material fact included in or omitted from (i) any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus used by such Underwriter or (ii) the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, in each case in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, in the judgment of the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm will be designated in writing by the Underwriters (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
Section 12) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 12), as the case may be. The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 12 to the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12(d) are several in proportion to the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
 
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Any other provisions of this Section 12 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Underwriters will not be required to contribute to the Company any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (other than in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto), and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and will not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
SECTION 13. The applicable Terms Agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the offering to which the Prospectus relates. The applicable Terms Agreement may not be terminated by the Underwriters prior to delivery of and payment for such Securities except upon the failure of any of the conditions precedent described in Section 6 hereof.
Termination.
SECTION 14. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained herein or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant hereto or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of a Terms Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

Exhibit A-1
1. The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the Company has corporate power and authority to issue the Underwritten Securities, to enter into the Terms Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder.
2. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability.
3. The Underwritten Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Terms Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Underwritten Securities are to be issued.
4. The Terms Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
5. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
6. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Indenture, the Underwritten Securities and the Terms Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") will not contravene (i) any provision of the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provided that counsel need not express an opinion as to federal or state securities laws, (ii) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, or (iii) any agreement that is specified in an annex to the opinion.
7. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Documents, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which counsel need not express an opinion.
 
Counsel has considered the statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the notes" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Underwritten Securities. In counsel's opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects. The statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations for Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, in counsel's opinion fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (2) through (4) above, counsel may assume that each party to the Documents (other than the Company) has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, counsel may assume that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, provided that counsel will not make such assumption to the extent that counsel has specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Terms Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
Counsel need not express an opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
 
Exhibit A-2
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters, financial, accounting or quantitative information or oil and gas reserve data. Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of the notes" and "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations for Non-U.S. Holders"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
(i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
(ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Underwritten Securities:

The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal (or, if the Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of the Securities of any series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Issuer shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of such series and the principal of any and all Securities of such series which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest, at the same rate as the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified in the Securities of such series to the date of such payment or deposit) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith, and if any and all Events of Default under the Indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities which shall have become due by acceleration, shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided hereinthen and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of such series, each series voting as a separate class, then Outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults with respect to such series and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences, but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
 
For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.

Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities.

Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.

Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any

Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series , of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.

sinking fund payment date
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series or (d) which have been converted into Common Stock or otherwise acquired by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of such Securities. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 10.05) signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking
 
fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Issuer shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 11.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 11.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 11.03) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
On or prior to each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date.
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series
provided
 
at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 4 and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 4.10 or the default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
Section 12.01The Issuer may at its option, by Board Resolution, at any time, elect to defease the Issuer's obligations under the Outstanding Securities of any series and this Indenture in accordance with either Section 12.02 or Section 12.03 upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 12. Notwithstanding any such election, the terms of the Securities of such series shall remain in full force and effect.

For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under the Securities of such series and this Indenture insofar as the Securities of such series are concerned (and the Trustee, upon an Issuer Order and at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of holders of Outstanding Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 12.04 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and interest on the Securities of such series when such payments are due, (b) the Issuer's obligations with respect to such Securities of such series under Sections 2.08, 2.09 and 3.02, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, including but not limited to Article 5, (d) the Issuer's right of optional redemption, if any, (e) the rights of Holders to receive mandatory sinking fund payments, if any, and (f) this Article 12.

(b) No Event of Default or event which after notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit.

(d) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be permitted by, and shall not result in breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which it is bound.
 
(e) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not cause any Securities of such series then listed on any registered national securities exchange under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to be delisted.
(f) In the case of an election under Section 12.02, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, (i) the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred, and (ii) that after the passage of 90 days (or such other period of time as then required by the non-insider preference provisions of any applicable federal bankruptcy laws) following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and (iii) that there would not occur any violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, on the part of the Issuer, the trust funds representing such deposit or the Trustee as a result of such deposit and the related exercise of the Issuer's election under this Article 12.

Such Opinion shall also cover the matters referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 12.04(f).
(h) The Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable Issuer Order to apply the monies so deposited towards payment of all indebtedness on the Securities of such series at their stated maturity or earlier date of redemption, and an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the defeasance under Section 12.02 or the covenant defeasance under Section 12.03 (as the case may be) have been complied with.

Section 13.01Securities of any series which are convertible into Common Stock shall be convertible in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
. Applicability; Conversion Privilege and Conversion Price.
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 13, at the option of the Holder thereof, any Security or any portion of the principal amount thereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 may be converted at the principal amount thereof, (or, with respect to Original Issue Discount Securities, at the amount determined pursuant to Section 2.03), or of such portion thereof, into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest one-hundredth of a share) of Common Stock, at the Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. Such conversion right shall expire at the close of business on the date specified for Securities of such series. In case a Security or portion thereof is called for redemption, such conversion right in respect of the Security or portion so called shall expire at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption, unless the Issuer defaults in making the payment due upon redemption.
The price at which shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon conversion (herein called the "") shall be the price specified in
Conversion Price
 
relation to Securities of such series pursuant to Section 2.03. The Conversion Price shall be adjusted in certain instances as provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) of Section 13.04.
Section 13.02In order to exercise the conversion privilege, the Holder of any Security to be converted shall surrender such Security, together with the conversion notice duly executed, at any office or agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.02, accompanied by written notice to the Issuer at such office or agency that the Holder elects to convert such Security or, if less than the entire principal amount thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted. Securities or portions thereof surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any regular record date next preceding any interest payment date to the opening of business on such interest payment date shall (unless such Securities or portions thereof have been called for redemption on a redemption date within such period) be accompanied by payment to the Issuer or its order, in New York Clearing House funds or other funds acceptable to the Issuer, of an amount equal to the interest payable on such interest payment date on the principal amount of Securities or portions thereof being surrendered for conversion. No payment or adjustment shall be made upon any conversion on account of any interest accrued on the Securities surrendered for conversion or, except as provided in Section 13.04, on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon conversion.
. Exercise of Conversion Privilege.
Securities shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such Securities for conversion in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the Holders of such Securities as Holders shall cease, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock at such time. As promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date, the Issuer shall issue and shall deliver at such office or agency a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 13.03.
In the case of any Security which is converted in part only, upon such conversion the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the principal amount of such Security.
Section 13.03No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Securities. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which
. Fractions of Shares.
 
would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any Security or Securities (or specified portions thereof), the Issuer shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the market price (determined as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (f) of Section 13.04) at the close of business on the day of conversion.
Section 13.04. (a) In case the Issuer shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on any class of Capital Stock of the Issuer in Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (a), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Issuer but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Issuer will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Issuer.
Adjustment of Conversion Price.
(b) In case the Issuer shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the market price (determined as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such market price and the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Issuer but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Issuer will not issue any rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Issuer.
 
(c) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(d) In case the Issuer shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section, any dividend or distribution paid in cash out of the retained earnings of the Issuer and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination, reduced by the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Trustee) of the portion of the assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be such market price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.
(e) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to which Section 13.11 applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination") within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this Section, and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this Section).
 
(f) For the purpose of any computation under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this Section, the market price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily market prices for the ten consecutive Business Days selected by the Issuer commencing not less than ten nor more than 80 Business Days before the day in question. The closing price for each day shall be the last reported sales price regular way on the composite tape or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Issuer for that purpose.
(g) The Issuer may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order that any event treated for Federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights shall not be taxable to the recipients.
Section 13.05Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided:
. Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Price.
(a) the Issuer shall compute the adjusted Conversion Price in accordance with Section 13.04 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, the Controller or an Assistant Controller of the Issuer setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall forthwith be filed with the Trustee and at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of Securities pursuant to Section 3.02; and
(b) a notice stating that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price shall forthwith be required, and as soon as practicable after it is required, such notice shall be prepared by the Issuer, filed with the Trustee and mailed by the Issuer to all Holders at their last addresses as they shall appear in the security register.

The failure to give notice required by this Section or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any dividend, distribution, rights, warrants, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote on any such action.
Section 13.07The Issuer shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Securities, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding Securities.

The Issuer shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Issuer the amount of any such tax, or has established to the satisfaction of the Issuer that such tax has been paid.
. Taxes on Conversions.
Section 13.09The Issuer covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities will upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable.
. Covenant as to Common Stock.
 
Section 13.10All Securities delivered for conversion shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation and the Trustee shall dispose of the same as provided in Section 2.10.
. Cancellation of Converted Securities.
Section 13.11In case of any consolidation of the Issuer with, or merger of the Issuer into, any other corporation, any merger of another corporation into the Issuer (other than a merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer) or any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, the corporation formed by such consolidation or resulting from such merger or which acquires such assets, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of each Security then outstanding shall have the right thereafter, during the period such Security shall be convertible as specified in Section 13.01, to convert such Security only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer into which such Security might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, assuming such holder of Common Stock of the Issuer (a) is not a corporation with which the Issuer consolidated or into which the Issuer merged or which merged into the Issuer or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (""), or an affiliate of a constituent corporation and (b) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer is not the same for each share of Common Stock of the Issuer held immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by others than a constituent corporation or an affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (""), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental indenture, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or transfers.
