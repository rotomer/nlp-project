(iii) If, at any time when a Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) relating to any Underwritten Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs or condition exists as a result of which the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, or any other applicable law, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters, by telephone or by facsimile (in either case with written confirmation from the Company by mail), to cease use and distribution of the Prospectus (and all then existing supplements thereto) and to suspend all efforts to resell the Underwritten Securities in its capacity as underwriter or dealer, as the case may be, and the Underwriters will promptly comply with the terms of such notice. The Company will forthwith prepare and cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, satisfactory in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and the Company will supply the Underwriters with one signed copy of such amended Registration Statement and as many copies of such amended or supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request.

SECTION 12. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which such Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act becomes subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Company agrees to reimburse each such

however
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission of a material fact or allegedly untrue statement or omission of a material fact included in or omitted from (i) any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus used by such Underwriter or (ii) the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, in each case in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, in the judgment of the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm will be designated in writing by the Underwriters (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
indemnified
party
indemnifying party
 
Section 12) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 12), as the case may be. The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 12 to the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12(d) are several in proportion to the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Any other provisions of this Section 12 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Underwriters will not be required to contribute to the Company any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (other than in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto), and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and will not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
SECTION 13. The applicable Terms Agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the offering to which the Prospectus relates. The applicable Terms Agreement may not be terminated by the Underwriters prior to delivery of and payment for such Securities except upon the failure of any of the conditions precedent described in Section 6 hereof.
Termination.
SECTION 14. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained herein or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant hereto or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of a Terms Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Indenture, the Underwritten Securities and the Terms Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") will not contravene (i) any provision of the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provided that counsel need not express an opinion as to federal or state securities laws, (ii) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, or (iii) any agreement that is specified in an annex to the opinion.
 
7. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Documents, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which counsel need not express an opinion.
Counsel has considered the statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the notes" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Underwritten Securities. In counsel's opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects. The statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations for Non-U.S. Holders," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, in counsel's opinion fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (2) through (4) above, counsel may assume that each party to the Documents (other than the Company) has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, counsel may assume that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, provided that counsel will not make such assumption to the extent that counsel has specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Terms Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
Counsel need not express an opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
 
Exhibit A-2
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters, financial, accounting or quantitative information or oil and gas reserve data. Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of the notes" and "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations for Non-U.S. Holders"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
(i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
(ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Underwritten Securities:
(a) on the date of the Terms Agreement, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
 
(b) at the Time of Sale, the Time of Sale Prospectus contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Prospectus as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data, or any oil and gas reserve data, included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1. In addition, we express no view as to the conveyance of the Time of Sale Prospectus or the information contained therein to investors.
 
Exhibit A-3
1. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the Underwritten Securities will not contravene any provision of the Restated Charter or By-Laws of the Company, or of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to counsel's knowledge, of any judgment, order, or decree of any governmental body, agency, or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing cases except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
2. The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business in the states of Arkansas and Texas and is in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company is not required to be qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business in any other jurisdiction.
3. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except for directors' qualifying shares and except as otherwise set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims.
4. To counsel's knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the properties of the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries is bound, which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and to counsel's knowledge, there is no agreement or other document that is required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus, or that is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, that is not so described or filed.
In rendering such opinion, counsel may rely, as to matters of fact, to the extent counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion will be limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Insofar as such opinion involves matters governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, counsel may rely, without independent investigation, on the opinion of Delaware counsel for the Company.

Notes
Section 2.01. . There is hereby created and authorized three series of Notes designated as the "2.500% Notes due 2017", which shall be a series initially limited to $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount and which shall be initially due on December 1, 2017, the "3.700% Notes due 2022", which shall be a series initially limited to $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount and which shall be initially due on December 1, 2022, and the "5.125% Notes due 2042", which shall be a series initially limited to $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount and which shall be initially due on December 1, 2042 (except, in respect of the aggregate principal amount of each such series, the Notes of such series authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes of such series pursuant to Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.11 or 11.03 of the Base Indenture).
Designation and Principal Amount
Section 2.02(a) The interest rate payable on the Notes of each series will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P or, if either Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes of such series or fails to make a rating of the Notes of such series publicly available for reasons outside of the Issuer's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act appointed by the Issuer with respect to the Notes of such series (a ""), downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Notes of such series, in the manner described below in this Section 2.02.
. Interest Rate Adjustment.
Substitute Ratings Agency
(b) If the rating from Moody's (or any Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) of the Notes of a series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will increase such that it will equal the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
(c) If the rating from S&P (or any Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) of the Notes of a series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes of that series will increase such that it will equal the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
(d) If at any time the interest rate on the Notes of a series has been increased and either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor), as the case may be, subsequently upgrades its rating of the Notes of such series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes of such series equals the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables in clauses (b) or (c) above in effect immediately following the upgrade in rating. If Moody's (or any Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) subsequently upgrades its rating of the Notes of a series to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Ratings Agency) or higher, and S&P (or any Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) upgrades its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Ratings Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance (and if one such upgrade occurs and the other does not, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will be decreased so that it does not reflect any increase attributable to the upgrading ratings agency). In addition, the interest rates on the Notes of each series will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent downgrade in the ratings by either or both of Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor)) if the Notes of such series become rated Baa1 and BBB+ (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute Ratings Agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor), respectively (or one of such ratings if the Notes are only rated by one of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor), respectively).
 
(e) Each adjustment required by any downgrade or upgrade in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Notes of a series be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes of a series exceed 2.00% (percentage points) above the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance.
(f) No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes of a series shall be made solely as a result of Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating of such series of Notes. If at any time Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of such series of Notes from a Substitute Ratings Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Ratings Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes of a series pursuant to the tables above (i) such Substitute Ratings Agency will be substituted for the last of Moody's or S&P to provide a rating of such series of Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (ii) the relative rating scale used by such Substitute Ratings Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Issuer and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute Ratings Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (iii) the interest rate on the Notes of such series will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Ratings Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (ii) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other ratings agency (Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor))).
(g) For so long as only one of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) provides a rating of the Notes of a series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of such series of Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the ratings agency (Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor)) providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as none of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) provides a rating of the Notes of a series, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% (percentage points) above the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance.
(h) Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first interest payment date following the date on which a rating change occurs that requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Ratings Agency therefor) changes its rating of the Notes of a series more than once prior to any particular interest payment date, the last change by such ratings agency prior to such interest payment date will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the Notes of such
 
series described above relating to such ratings agency's action.
