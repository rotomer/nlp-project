EXHIBIT 99.1 MeadWestvaco Announces Sale of 95,500 Acres of Forestland STAMFORD, CONN., December 13, 2002 -- MeadWestvaco Corporation (NYSE: MWV) yesterday completed the sale of 95,500 acres of forestland in West Virginia. The property was purchased through The Forestland Group LLC for Heartwood Forestland Fund IV Limited Partnership. The purchase price for the property was $50 million in cash, which represents a gain of approximately $38 million pretax on the sale for MeadWestvaco. While these tracts are valuable for a variety of purposes, they do not fit into MeadWestvaco's strategy of focusing resources and technology on the land base that will most efficiently support company mills. This sale is part of the company's previously announced plans to divest 950,000 non-strategic acres of the land it currently owns. MeadWestvaco Corporation, headquartered in Stamford, Conn., with annual sales of approximately $8 billion, is a leading global producer of packaging, coated and specialty papers, consumer and office products and specialty chemicals. The company operates in 33 countries, serves customers in approximately 100 nations and employs approximately 30,000 people worldwide. Using sustainable forestry practices, MeadWestvaco owns and manages more than 3 million acres of forests. For more information about MeadWestvaco, visit the company's website at www.meadwestvaco.com. The Forestland Group LLC (TFG) was formed in 1995 to pursue investments primarily in the naturally regenerating hardwood and pine forests for institutional investors, families and individuals. The firm invests capital in forestland through a limited partnership structure. TFG has raised and closed four funds totaling $681 million. With capital from university endowment funds, foundations, insurance companies, pension funds and individuals, TFG's limited partnerships have acquired, including acreage under contract, over 1.1 million acres in nine states in the U.S.: West Virginia, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and Texas.
