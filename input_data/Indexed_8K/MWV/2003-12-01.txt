Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
MeadWestvaco Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell up to $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its debt securities (the "Securities") in one or more fixed price offerings on terms determined at the time of sale. The Securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of April 2, 2002 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. Each issue of Securities may vary as to aggregate principal amount, maturity date, interest rate or rates and timing of payments thereof, redemption provisions and sinking fund requirements, if any, and any other variable terms which the Indenture contemplates may be set forth in the Securities as issued from time to time.
 
Each underwritten offering of Securities will be made through you or through an underwriting syndicate managed by you. Whenever the Company determines to make such an offering of Securities, it will enter into an agreement (the "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, you and such other underwriters, if any, selected by you as have authorized you to enter into such
Terms Agreement on their behalf (the "Underwriters", which term shall include you whether acting alone in the sale of Securities or as members of an underwriting syndicate). The Terms Agreement relating to each offering of Securities shall specify the principal amount of Securities to be issued and their terms not otherwise specified in the Indenture, the names of the Underwriters participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the principal amount of Securities which each severally agrees to purchase, the names of such other Underwriters, if any, acting as co-managers with you in connection with such offering, the price at which the Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, any delayed delivery arrangements and the time and place of delivery and payment. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between you and the Company. Each offering of Securities will be governed by this Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement, and this Agreement and such Terms Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each Underwriter participating in the offering of such Securities.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-103918) relating to the Securities and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required to the date hereof. Such registration statement as amended has been declared effective by the Commission, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement as amended and the prospectus relating to the sale of Securities by the Company constituting a part thereof, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively; provided, however, that a supplement to the Prospectus prepared pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof (a "Prospectus Supplement") shall be deemed to have supplemented, and become part of, the Prospectus only with respect to the offering of Securities to which it relates.
 
Section 1. . The Company represents and warrants to you as of the date hereof, and to each Underwriter named in a Terms Agreement as of the date thereof (in each case a "Representation Date"), as follows:
Representations and Warranties
 
(a) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement became effective and as of the applicable Representation Date, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Regulations") and the 1939 Act. The Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective and as of the applicable
 
Representation Date, did not, and will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement became effective and as of the applicable Representation Date, did not, and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the representations and warranties in this subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification under the 1939 Act (Form T-1), of the Trustee under the Indenture.
 
(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and, when read together with the other information in the Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto become effective, will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
 
(c) The accountants who certified the financial statements included in the Registration Statement are independent public accountants as required by the 1933 Act and the Regulations.
 
(d) The financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus present fairly the financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the results of their operations for the periods specified; said financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis, except as otherwise stated therein, during the periods involved.
 
(e) Since the date of the latest audited financial statements incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, except as otherwise stated in the Prospectus or contemplated thereby, (A) there has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business and (B) there have been no material transactions entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than those in the ordinary course of business.
 
(f) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its certificate of incorporation or in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which it or any of them is a party or by which it or any of them or their properties may be bound; and the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Indenture and each Terms Agreement, the incurrence of the obligations herein and therein set forth and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement or lease to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it may be bound, by any law, administrative regulation or court decree.
 
(g) The Indenture has been duly authorized and executed by the Company, has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights.
 
(h) The Securities have been duly authorized for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement (or will have been so authorized prior to each issuance of Securities) and, when issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and of the Indenture against payment of the consideration therefor in accordance with this Agreement, the Securities will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights and will be entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, which will be substantially in the form heretofore delivered to you.
 
(i) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency is necessary or required for the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, in connection with the offering, issuance or sale by the Company of the Securities hereunder or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be performed by it or for the performance of the Indenture by the Company, except such as have been already obtained or as may be required under the 1933 Act, the 1939 Act, the 1934 Act or the Regulations or state securities laws.
 
(j) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and authority
 
(corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; and the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified, be in good standing or to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business.
 
(k) The Indenture conforms, in all material respects, to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus and the Securities, when they are delivered and paid for pursuant to the Terms Agreement at the Closing Time (as hereinafter defined) or, if applicable, pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (as hereinafter defined) and have been duly executed and authenticated, will conform, in all material respects, to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus.
 
Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to you or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with an offering of Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to the matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter participating in such offering.
 
Section 2. . The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase Securities pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.
Purchase and Sale
 
Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, any Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be made at the offices of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, 80 Pine Street, New York, New York 10005, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by you and the Company, at 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the third (fourth, if the pricing occurs after 4:30 P.M. (Eastern Time) on any given day) business day or at such other time as shall be agreed upon by you and the Company (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10) following the date of the applicable Terms Agreement or such other time as shall be agreed upon by you and the Company (each such time and date being referred to as a "Closing Time"). Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds against delivery to you for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Securities to be purchased by them. Such Securities shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as you may request in writing at least two business days prior to the applicable Closing Time. Such Securities, which may be in temporary form, will be made available for examination and packaging by you on or before the first business day prior to Closing Time.
 
If authorized by the applicable Terms Agreement, the Underwriters named therein may solicit offers to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto with such changes therein as the Company may approve. As compensation for arranging Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company will pay to you at Closing Time, for the accounts of the Underwriters, a fee equal to that percentage of the principal amount of Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made at Closing Time as is specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. Any Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types set forth in the Prospectus. At Closing Time the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts (for not less than the minimum principal amount of Securities per Delayed Delivery Contract specified in the applicable Terms Agreement) with all purchasers proposed by the Underwriters and previously approved by the Company as provided below, but not for an aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of that specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility for the validity of performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts.
 
You are to submit to the Company, at least three business days prior to Closing Time, the names of any institutional investors with which it is proposed that the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts and the principal amount of Securities to be purchased by each of them, and the Company will advise you, at least two business days prior to Closing Time, of the names of the institutions with which the making of Delayed Delivery Contracts is approved by the Company and the principal amount of Securities to be covered by each such Delayed Delivery Contract.
 
The principal amount of Securities agreed to be purchased by the respective Underwriters pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be reduced by the principal amount of Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts as to each Underwriter as set forth in a written notice delivered by you to the Company; provided, however, that the total principal amount of Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the total amount of Securities covered by the applicable Terms Agreement, less the principal amount of Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts.
 
Section 3. . The Company covenants with you, and with each Underwriter participating in the applicable offering of Securities, as follows:
Covenants of the Company
 
(a) Immediately following the execution of each Terms Agreement, the Company will prepare a Prospectus Supplement setting forth the principal amount of Securities covered thereby and their terms not otherwise specified in the Indenture, the names of the Underwriters participating in the offering and the principal amount of Securities which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of any Underwriters acting as co-managers with you in connection with the offering, the price at which the
 
Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, the selling concession and reallowance, if any, any delayed delivery arrangements, and such other information as you and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Securities. The Company will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of the Regulations and will use its best efforts to furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus and such Prospectus Supplement as the Underwriters shall reasonably request, prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the business day next succeeding the date of the applicable Terms Agreement. Thereafter, the Company will furnish to the Underwriters as many copies of the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement as the Underwriters may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(b) If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of your counsel or counsel for the Company, to further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement comply with such requirements. The Company will provide the Underwriters and their counsel with copies of any such documents for their review and comment a reasonable amount of time prior to any proposed filing and will not file any such amendment or supplement to which the Underwriters may reasonably object in writing.
 
(c) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, in each case as soon as practicable, earnings statements (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act), covering (i) a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement and (ii) a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the date of each Terms Agreement and each filing under the 1934 Act of an annual report of the Company on Form 10-K.
 
(d) The Company will give you notice of its intention to file any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act, or otherwise, will furnish you with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of filing, and will not file any such amendment or supplement or other documents in a form in which you or your counsel shall reasonably object.
 
(e) The Company will notify each of you immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) of the mailing or the delivery to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act, (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, and (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
 
(f) The Company will deliver to you as many signed and conformed copies of the registration statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) as you may reasonably request and will also deliver to you a conformed copy of the Registration Statement and each amendment thereto for each of the Underwriters.
 
(g) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with you, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as you may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer of securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. In each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified as above provided, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction.
 
(h) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act.
 
(i) Between the date of any Terms Agreement and termination of any trading restrictions as notified by you to the Company or Closing Time, whichever is later, with respect to the Securities covered thereby, the Company will not, without your prior consent, offer or sell, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company with a maturity of more than one year, including additional Securities.
 
(j) The Company will for a period of five years from the effective date of the Registration Statement furnish direct to you and to each Underwriter participating in the applicable offering of Securities, upon request, as soon as the same shall be sent to stockholders, copies of any annual or interim reports of the Company to its stockholders, and it will also furnish you, upon request, the following:
 
(1) as soon as available, copies of any report which the Company shall file with the Commission or mail to stockholders; and
 
(2) such other information as you may reasonably request which affects the holders of the applicable Securities.
 
Section 4. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Securities pursuant to any Terms Agreement are subject to the accuracy of and compliance with the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company's officers made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following conditions:
Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations

(b) At the applicable Closing Time you shall have received:
 
(i) The favorable opinion, dated as of the applicable Closing Time of Wendell L. Willkie, II, Esq., Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to such of you as may be named in the applicable Terms Agreement, to the effect that:
 
(A) The Company has been incorporated in accordance with, and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under, the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(B) The Company has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement.
 
(C) The Company is qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification; and each wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company has been organized in accordance with, and is validly existing and in good standing under, the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
 
(D) This Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement, and the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, have been authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
(E) The Indenture has been authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights.
 
(F) The Securities covered by the applicable Terms Agreement are in the form contemplated by the Indenture, have been authorized by all necessary corporate action and, when executed and authenticated as specified in the Indenture and delivered against payment pursuant to this Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
(G) The Indenture and the Securities covered by the applicable Terms Agreement conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus and the applicable Prospectus Supplement.
 
(H) The Indenture is qualified under the 1939 Act.
 
(I) The Registration Statement is effective under the 1933 Act and, to the best of the knowledge and information of such counsel, no proceedings for a stop order have been instituted or threatened under Section 8(d) of the 1933 Act.
 
(J) The Registration Statement (other than the financial statements included therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1939 Act, and the Regulations, and nothing has come to the attention of such counsel that would lead such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, or if an amendment to the Registration Statement or an annual report on Form 10-K has been filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, then at the time of the most recent such filing, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of its date or as amended or supplemented at Closing Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
(K) Each document, if any, filed pursuant to the 1934 Act (other than the financial statements included therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive when so filed in all material respects with the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1934 Act Regulations").
 
(L) To the best of the knowledge and information of such counsel, there are no contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, leases or other documents of a character required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement other than those filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Registration Statement.
 
(M) To the best of the knowledge and information of such counsel, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened in writing against the Company or any of its subsidiaries which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, other than those discussed therein, and the information set forth therein to the extent that it constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by such counsel and is correct; and
 
(N) The issuance of the Securities by the Company will not conflict with or result in a breach of (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii) to such counsel's knowledge, any law, statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement or instrument actually known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument.
 
(ii) The favorable opinion or opinions, dated as of the applicable Closing Time, of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, with respect to the matters set forth in (A) and (D) to (J), inclusive, of subsection (b)(i) of this Section.
 
(c) At the applicable Closing Time (i) there shall not have been, since the date of the applicable Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and other than as contemplated therein, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business; (ii) there shall not have been subsequent to the date of the applicable Terms Agreement any transactions entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than transactions in the ordinary course of business or transactions referred to in the
 
Registration Statement or transactions which are not material in relation to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; (iii) since the date of the applicable Terms Agreement neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained a loss of, or damage to, its properties (whether or not insured) which would materially adversely affect the business, operations, financial condition or income of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; (iv) except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, no action, suit or proceeding, at law or in equity, shall be pending or to the knowledge of any of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President, an Executive Vice President, or a Senior Vice President (each a "Senior Officer") of the Company, threatened in writing against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no proceedings shall be pending or to the knowledge of any Senior Officer of the Company threatened in writing against the Company or any of its subsidiaries before or by any governmental commission, board or other administrative agency, wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the business, operations, financial condition or income of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; and (v) each of the representations and warranties contained in Section 1 hereof shall be true and correct with the same effect as though the Closing Time were a Representation Date. Compliance with the provisions of (i) to (v), inclusive, of this subsection shall be evidenced by a certificate of a Senior Officer of the Company delivered to you at such Closing Time.
 
(d) You shall have received from the Company's independent public accountants a letter, dated as of the applicable Closing Time and delivered at such time, in form heretofore agreed to (based upon the draft letter heretofore delivered).
 
(e) At the applicable Closing Time counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to you and counsel for the Underwriters.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and directors and each person if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act as follows:
 
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission
 
therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or was made in reliance upon the Form T-1 of the Trustee under the Indenture;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever contemplated by this Section, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever which, in any such case, is based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (other than any fees and expenses of counsel described in the fourth and fifth sentences of subsection (c) of this Section 6) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each of its directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company, but only with respect to statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or a preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
 
(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with such action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, unless (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party; in such cases the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel.
 
Section 7. . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unavailable to the Underwriters other than in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters of each offering of Securities shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of such Underwriters in respect of such offering in such proportions as will reflect the relative benefits from the offering of such Securities received by the Company on the one hand and by such Underwriters on the other hand; , that, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the relevant offering of Securities on the other hand. If the Securities are offered by Underwriters at an initial public offering price set forth in a Prospectus Supplement, the relative benefits shall be deemed to be such that the
Contribution
provided
 
Underwriters shall be responsible for that portion of the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing in such Prospectus Supplement bears to the initial public offering price appearing therein and the Company shall be responsible for the balance. The relative fault, if applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
 
Section 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of any Securities to the Underwriters.

Termination

In the event of any such termination, (x) the covenants set forth in Section 3 with respect to any offering of Securities shall remain in effect so long as any Underwriter owns any such Securities purchased from the Company pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and (y) the covenant set forth in Section 3(c), the provisions of Section 5, the indemnity agreement set forth in Section 6, the contribution provisions set forth in Section 7, and the provisions of Sections 8 and 13 shall remain in effect.

(b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement shall terminate, without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement.
 
In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters as set forth in this Section, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order that any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

Exhibit 4(b)
 
 
 
CUSIP: 583334 AD 9
 
MEADWESTVACO CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to , or registered assigns, the principal sum of $125,000,000 Dollars on December 1, 2005, and to pay interest thereon from December 1, 2003, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 in each year commencing March 1, 2004, at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR (as defined below) plus 0.58%, as determined by the Calculation Agent, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by adding the daily interest amount for each day in the Interest Period. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the 15

th
calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities
of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the offices or agencies of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check drawn upon any Paying Agent and mailed on or prior to an Interest Payment Date to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.
provided, however
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof, directly or through an authenticating agent, by the manual signature of an authorized officer, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
Dated: December 1, 2003
 
 
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated: December 1, 2003
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2002 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof initially limited in aggregated principal amount to $125,000,000.
 
Upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Company may redeem this Security, in whole or in part, on any Interest Payment Date on or after December 1, 2004, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount hereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest hereon, if any, to the Redemption Date. Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in the Indenture.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the
Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series (voting together as a single class) to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series (voting together as single class) at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. However, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Security or the Indenture, the interest rate on this Security will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law or general application.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
Interest on this Security will accrue from, and including, December 1, 2003, to, and excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity, as the case may be (each, an "Interest Period"). The amount of accrued interest for any Interest Period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from December 1, 2003, or from the last date the Company paid interest, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360.
 
If the Stated Maturity of this Security falls on day that is not a Business Day, the Company shall pay principal and interest on the next succeeding Business Day, but will deem that payment was made on the date that the payment was due. No interest will accrue for the period beginning on the Stated Maturity to the payment date on such next Business Day.
 
The interest rate on this Security will be reset quarterly, will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be equal to LIBOR plus 0.58%, except that the interest rate will not exceed the rate permitted by applicable law. The Interest Determination Date for an Interest Period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such Interest Period. Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee of the interest rate for the next Interest Period. Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holder thereof.

If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
