In January 2004, the Compensation Committee established the following performance objectives and assigned the weightings set forth below under the Long-Term Incentive portion of the Plan.
 
 
The Compensation Committee reviewed performance against the established goals under both the Annual and Long-Term Incentive portions of the Plan, and awards were made in accordance with such established metrics. The minimum payout under each portion of the Plan for the 2004 year was determined by Plan formula and could be less than 100% of the participant's target payout. The maximum award possible is 200% of the participant's target payout, however, the actual amount of any single annual award or long-term award paid to any participant may not exceed $2,000,000. The individual target amounts for our senior executive officers who participate in the Plan range from 50-116% of salary for the Annual Incentive portion of the Plan payable in a lump sum and from 117-306% of salary payable over a three-year period for the Long-Term Incentive portion of the Plan.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
