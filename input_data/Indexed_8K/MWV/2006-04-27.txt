TAX REPORTING PROCESS TO THE IRS
Many relocation expenses are taxable income to the transferee according to IRS regulations. Therefore corporations are required to report relocation costs and the associated taxes withheld to the IRS on a regular basis. After those calculations have been completed by GMAC GRS, the taxable amounts of the relocation expenses are provided to MeadWestvaco for updates to the employee payroll record. These updates are applied to the employee payroll records in a special run with a check date different from the normal salaried pay date. Employees can review these updates via Employee essentials using the paycheck review function. In most cases, your take home pay will not be impacted by the additional data included in your payroll records.
All relocation expenses should be submitted by October 31
st
if possible, as this is the year-end cut-off for relocation expenses. Subsequent expenses will be included in the next year's income. The assistance provided by MeadWestvaco is based only on income earned by the employee at MeadWestvaco. Spouse/Partner or other employee income will not be used in the calculation.
Employees should seek the advice of a tax accountant or financial advisor for assistance or advice on tax returns or the impact of the relocation on their financial position. This assistance is not reimbursable, however the employee may use funds from their Miscellaneous Relocation Expense Allowance for this expense.
Should you have any further questions on this process, please contact your Consultant for more details.

HOME FINDING & TEMPORARY LIVING LUMP SUM ALLOWANCE
MeadWestvaco will provide a lump sum payment intended to cover most expenses incurred in locating both temporary and permanent housing at the new work location. This one time allowance is in place of submitting individual expense reports for typically receipted house hunting and temporary living expenses. The purpose of this lump sum allowance is for you to tailor this allowance and its monies around your personal plans and needs in the house hunting and temporary living areas.
It is important to note that if your overall relocation costs in these two areas are less than your allowance from MeadWestvaco, the savings are yours. Conversely, if your total relocation costs in these areas exceed your allowance those additional expenses must be borne by you.
GMAC GRS will be coordinating the payment of this lump sum allowance and they should also be used in the planning and scheduling of your house hunting trip, the selection of the best real estate agent or agents in the new work location, and to identify the preferred facilities to be utilized for temporary living. Should you have any questions on the lump sum calculation / formula found below, please direct that inquiry to your Consultant.
This allowance will be paid according to the following table:
For Existing Homeowner With Family // Policy A
 
For Single Homeowner // Policy A
 
To receive this lump sum allowance, you must sign and submit / fax the Home Finding & Temporary Living Lump Sum Allowance Form found at the back of this guide to your GMAC GRS Consultant who will review and approve it for payment.
This non-receipted lump sum payment is intended to cover but not be limited to the following expenses:

Please contact your GMAC GRS Consultant for a list of the company approved temporary living facilities. Should you need additional time in temporary housing and have already paid for 60 days lodging out of your lump sum, an additional 60 days of lodging expense may be approved and direct-billed to GMAC GRS. To be eligible for this extension, you must be staying in an approved facility and must provide documentation of the length of your stay to your Consultant.
Tax Treatment:
Home Finding & Temporary Living Lump Sum Allowance will be grossed up.
Note: We would strongly encourage you not to purchase a home in the new location which may be considered ineligible under a future move. In particular, homes with Synthetic Stucco or similar issues may experience buyer resistance to this product as well as potentially high costs associated with either litigation, repairs and or both. Please consult with your Consultant for further information.
A referral fee will be collected from the home finding real estate agent by GMAC GRS as this helps offset the overall relocation costs to MeadWestvaco.

How the Marketing Process Works
The following is a step-by-step process of marketing assistance services provided by your Consultant.
Agent Selection and Referrals
Your Consultant will arrange for two experienced local real estate agents to advise you about selling and pricing strategies that work best in your location. If you have personal preferences about an agent, your Consultant should make the initial contact and referral with the agent. As a requirement of the MeadWestvaco program, it is not permissible to select and use a listing agent who is an employee of MeadWestvaco, a spouse/partner of a MeadWestvaco employee, or a relative of a MeadWestvaco employee. .
A referral fee is charged to the listing agent and is designed to help offset the costs of the entire program for MeadWestvaco
Market Analysis
The two selected real estate agents will be asked by your Consultant to complete a market analysis on your home that will be used to prepare a marketing strategy. The market analysis will describe the current marketplace along with the agent's opinion of the most probable sales price for your home. The analysis also contains a suggested sales action plan with recommendations for preparing your home for optimum market exposure.
Inspections
Inspections as called for by suppliers, local custom and or GMAC GRS may be ordered on your property at the same time you are going through the agent selection process. The inspections that can be ordered by your Consultant may include but are not limited to the following: pest, general home, radon, well, septic, synthetic stucco, structural, asbestos, mold, roof, pool, etc. The inspectors will call to set up appointments.
Please be sure to schedule these inspections as soon as possible in order to eliminate any possible delays in receiving your appraised value offer.
Listing Your Home
Your Consultant will ask you to select one real estate agent from the two you have interviewed. He or she will then work with you and your selected agent to develop a marketing strategy and establish a list price that is both attractive and realistic in the local market. During the first 90-day marketing period, it is a requirement of this program that your list price be no higher than 10% above the listing broker's sales price analysis. By marketing your home at the suggested list price, your home is more likely to sell quickly. The best offers are usually received within the first 30 days of listing your home.
Disclosure Statement
You will be provided with a property disclosure statement or statements by GMAC GRS and or the listing agent. These statements must be accurately completed and returned to GMAC GRS before your appraisal value / home sale offer can be officially released to you.

Listing Exclusion Clause
When you first speak with your Consultant, he or she will discuss the necessity of including the following language in the listing agreement with your agent. The reason for this clause is to allow for cancellation of the listing agreement if you decide to accept the "Appraised Value" offer from the relocation company. This clause is considered "standard operating procedure" among agents who work with Consultants and those who list homes for corporate transferees.
The following Exclusion Clause should be signed by you and your real estate agent and attached as an addendum to the Listing Agreement.
"In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Addendum and the Listing Agreement, the terms of this Addendum shall control.

Monitoring the Marketing Process
Your Consultant will work with you and your real estate agent throughout the marketing process to ensure maximum exposure for your home, provide feedback on the marketing process, and recommend strategy modifications, if needed.
Home Marketing Incentive Bonus

The bonus is being offered because securing a buyer is advantageous both for you and for MeadWestvacoYou receive the best possible market price, and MeadWestvaco avoids the significant expense of purchasing, maintaining, and reselling your home through the relocation company.

The Incentive Bonus will be considered taxable income to you and is not grossed up for tax impact.
Buyer Incentive
To give your home an edge over the competition and to help it sell faster, MeadWestvaco will give an allowance of up to 2% of the negotiated sale price capped at $3,000 to be used as a credit to the buyer at closing. The incentive may be given as a credit in the form of closing costs, mortgage buy-down, repairs, homeowner's warranty or decorating allowance. The credit must always appear on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Please consult with your Consultant for more details.
Please make sure you communicate this very attractive resale incentive to your listing agent. The agent should actively promote this unique selling feature through a flyer in your home to the real estate community and most importantly to potential buyers.

Home Sale Program Timeline
Appraised Value Offer
Your decision to relocate should not be hampered by concerns about selling your home. GMAC GRS will assist you by making an offer to purchase your home at a value established by independent fee appraisers
.
Appraisal Process
When your Consultant introduces you to the home sale services, he or she will fully explain the appraisal process. You will be given a list of independent appraisers in your area and asked to select two (2) appraisers from this list. You may not select or request appraisers be used that are not on GMAC GRS' initial appraiser list or that are family members. You are encouraged to interview the appraisers to assist in making your decision. If you do not feel qualified to make the selection, ask your real estate agent for guidance or your Consultant can help you make the selection.
Once you have selected two appraisers, notify your Consultant. He or she will call the appraisers and ask them to contact you directly to arrange a convenient time for an inspection of the property. The appraisers' appointments should be scheduled at least two to three hours apart.
When the appraisers arrive to inspect your property, you should be prepared to discuss any facts that may be important in determining the value of your property such as:
 
 
The appraisers may ask for a copy of the land survey and a copy of the title policy that you received when you closed on the property. They will need these items to obtain the correct legal description.
We also encourage you to provide the appraisers with any information on similar homes that have recently sold in your area on the Pre-Appraisal Worksheet.

MeadWestvaco

HOME SALE ASSISTANCE
Appraised Value Offer - continued
The Appraisal
An appraisal is an estimate or opinion of value. Appraisers estimate value primarily by comparing your home to the sales of similar properties, making detailed adjustments for the differences between those properties and yours. Along with other factors, the appraisers consider location, size, condition and marketability. Other considerations include financing and supply and demand for your neighborhood.
Your home will be appraised in "as is" condition. Therefore, it is important that your home shows favorably to maximize the appraised value and resale efforts.
Title Search
In addition to arranging for the appraisals and inspections, a title search will be initiated in order to prepare for closing. Please inform your real estate agent that GMAC GRS is bringing the title up-to-date. This can avoid a duplicate title search. Often an agent will arrange for a title search upon notification from a lender of a buyer's loan approval.
Determining the Appraised Value Offer
Your offer will equal the average of the two independent appraisals. However, if the variance between the two appraisals is greater than 5% of the higher amount, a third appraisal will be ordered. In this case, your offer will be determined by averaging the two closest appraisals.
Example:
 
Your Consultant will calculate your offer only after the appraisers' reports and all required inspection reports have been received and reviewed.

HOME SALE ASSISTANCE
Appraised Value Offer - continued
The Offer Period
Your Consultant will call you with the Appraised Value Offer approximately 14 to 21 days from the time the last appraiser and inspector visited your home. Your 120-day acceptance period begins when your Consultant contacts you with the offer. Up to two 30-day extensions may be granted for a total of 180-day offer period. After a total of 90 days on the market, it is required that you amend your list price to be no higher than 110% of the Appraised Value Offer in order to maximize your opportunities for a sale.
The Appraised Value Offer should be considered a "safety net" offer in the event you are unable to sell your home.
Accepting the Appraised Value Offer
If you are unable to sell your home during the 120-day offer period and accept the Appraised Value Offer, you and your spouse/partner (all title holders) will need to sign GMAC GRS' Contract of Sale and return both copies to your Consultant along with the other supporting documents. Your execution of the Contract of Sale is a legal transaction.
The signed Contract of Sale and related documents must be received by your Consultant on or prior to the expiration date of your offer. The contract will be dated on the day all necessary documents are complete and signed by your Consultant.
After you and GMAC GRS has signed the Contract of Sale, you will continue to be responsible for the costs including but not limited to maintenance of your home, payments for utilities, mortgage, taxes, premiums for insurance, and any necessary homeowner association dues until you actually vacate. Prior to vacating, you will be expected to cooperate fully with all attempts by GMAC GRS to market the home by allowing prospective purchasers to view the premises by appointment during reasonable hours.
Amended Value Sale
Achieving an Amended Sale is of benefit to you and MeadWestvaco. The Company avoids the significant expense of purchasing, maintaining and reselling the home; and you receive the highest possible price for your home.
If at any time during your initial marketing period or 120-day acceptance period you receive an offer through the efforts of your Realtor, regardless of the offer amount, you must submit the offer to your Consultant for review.
Your Consultant will be able to assist you in negotiating the offer for the highest possible price as well as reviewing the offer with you to determine items that may not be covered under the relocation plan. Once the final offer has been approved, your Consultant will amend your Contract of Sale to reflect the buyer's offer.

There are many advantages in participating in the Amended Value Sale program
 
 
 
 
 
Example:
MeadWestvaco allows you to accept an offer from a buyer down to 97% of the Appraised Value. You will receive the Appraised Value Offer plus the Incentive Bonus.
 
You will receive your equity based on the $150,000 Appraised Offer plus an Incentive Bonus of $2,960 based on the sales price of $148,000.
Receiving Offers and Negotiating the Sale
When you receive a written offer for your home, you must immediately call your Consultant accepting it  even verbally. DO NOT SIGN a contract (or any other document) with the buyers or take any money as a deposit from the Realtor or prospective buyer. Remember, your Consultant is available to assist you in the negotiation process and to objectively review the offer with you once a buyer is found.
before
If the offer is "Bona Fide", GMAC GRS will sign the documents and close the transaction with your buyers.
Determining a "Bona Fide" Offer
Once you give your Consultant the details of the outside offer, he or she will determine if it is "bona fide". A bona fide offer is not subject to the sale of the buyer's property, does not contain any unusual or unreasonable terms and is not subject to interim financing, or other contingencies.

Vacating the Home
You have 60 days from the date GMAC GRS signs the Contract of Sale in which to vacate the property.

LOSS ON SALE
Overview
During periods of downturn in the real estate market, you may find that the appraised value for your home is less than what you have invested in your home. To minimize your concern about a substantial loss on your home, MeadWestvaco will guarantee the original purchase price and the cost of qualified capital improvements against loss on sale if you sell your home under the Marketing Assistance / Amended Value program. The loss and qualified capital improvements would be covered up to 115% of the appraised value established for your home by the appraisal process or the sales price, whichever is greater to a maximum of $25,000 (provided an Amended Value Sale is achieved). If your home is not sold and you accept GMAC GRS' appraised value offer then your loss and qualified capital improvements will be covered up to 105% of GMAC GRS' appraised value offer or $ 25,000 whichever is less (see examples found on page 23).
This guideline is intended to provide reasonable protection to you as a transferring homeowner employee. It is not a guarantee, however, that you will be kept whole for all that has been invested in improving and fixing up the property; nor does it protect costs determined to be associated with excess land, extremes of design, complexity, or elaborateness in which you have invested.
Eligibility
This guarantee is subject to the following provisions and must be approved by the Head of Human Resources for your business unit or corporate department.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Qualified Capital Improvements
Qualified capital improvements are those major improvements which are fixed additions to the property, prolong its useful life, or adapt it to new uses. Qualified capital improvements do not include repairs or upkeep to maintain the home in good condition nor do they include changes, such as interior decorating, done to reflect the owner's taste. Only capital improvements which cost $500 or more will be taken into account. Some examples of qualified capital improvements are:

Procedure
It is your responsibility to notify your Consultant when the appraised value offer is less than the original purchase price and cost of qualified capital improvements. Notification must be made in the form of a memorandum and include the following details:
 
 
 
Attached to this memorandum, in a legible and chronological list, must be all receipts and other records to satisfactorily document the expenditures listed. Also, attached must be a copy of the closing statement. Your Consultant will obtain approval from your Division Manager or Corporate Department Head to reimburse you the loss on original purchase price and qualified capital improvements consistent with the policy.
The amount guaranteed by MeadWestvaco will not change the appraised value offer to you. However, the Company will pay you the difference between the price at which GMAC GRS acquires the home and the amount guaranteed. MeadWestvaco will pay this difference when you have signed and returned the Contract of Sale to GMAC GRS. The original purchase price is considered the recorded amount which you paid for the home. It does not include settlement fees or closing costs which you may have paid.
This benefit can be altered or rescinded at any time subject to changes in real estate market conditions.

Destination Services
Selecting a house can be an exciting process. It can also be time-consuming and stressful, particularly when you and your family are relocating to a new area. GMAC GRS provides home finding counseling at no cost to you. It is intended to assist you in locating the right home quickly and easily.
Please make note that GMAC GRS must make the initial contact with all real estate agents both in the listing of your current residence and in the purchasing of a new home.
Your Consultant will contact you to discuss your family's specific needs, preferences, and lifestyle. After review of your family's requirements, your Consultant will work with the real estate community in the new area to select and assign a real estate professional who is experienced in the areas of importance to you. By planning in advance, the realtor will be prepared to take you on an area tour and discuss items of interest to you and your family.
Your Consultant and real estate agent will work together so that your visits are convenient and productive. Throughout the home finding period your Consultant will continue to work with you and your agent to ensure your satisfaction.
As a requirement of the MeadWestvaco program, it is not permissible to select and use a home finding agent who is an employee of MeadWestvaco, a spouse/partner of a MeadWestvaco employee, or a relative of a MeadWestvaco employee. .
A referral fee is charged to the home finding agent and is designed to help offset the costs of the entire program for MeadWestvaco
Note: We would strongly encourage you not to purchase a home in the new location with Synthetic Stucco due to growing buyer resistance to this product as well as potential high costs associated with either litigation, repairs and or both. Please consult with your Consultant for further information.

Home Purchase Assistance
Equity Advance
If you are a current homeowner who will be closing through GMAC GRS and need a partial advance of your equity to purchase a new home, your Consultant will provide you with an interest-free equity advance of up to 95% of the substantiated equity in your home. Equity is calculated based on the Appraised Value Offer amount. The loan amount required will be determined based upon receipt of a fully executed contract of purchase for the new home and execution of a promissory note. Obtaining an equity advance obligates you to either sell your property directly to GMAC GRS through the Appraised Value Offer or obtain a sale, using the Amended Value Sale Program. Your equity advance will be deducted from your final equity payment once you contract with GMAC GRS.
Please remember the following when requesting an equity advance:
 
 
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Due to the recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act, MeadWestvaco and GMAC GRS are forbidden by law to advance an equity advance to any officer of MeadWestvaco.
If you are in this category within MeadWestvaco and are ineligible for an equity advance and need funds prior to the full execution by both parties of the Contract of Sale, you may be eligible to obtain a "swing loan" through an external lender. The company will provide monthly payments or a lump sum payment to you equivalent to the interest charged by the external lender. The "swing loan" may not exceed 95% of the equity in your home and the payments from the company as noted above will be made to you as long as the relocation benefits apply (up to one year by policy, unless an exception is granted). Please contact your consultant for further information.
Closing Costs
As a current homeowner, if you purchase a primary residence in the new location within one year from your effective date of transfer you will be reimbursed for certain reasonable and customary closing costs incurred on the purchase of your home. (In order to qualify for reimbursement of new home closing costs, you must have owned a home in the former work location.)
Reasonable and customary home purchase expenses include:

You must submit a relocation expense report noting all allowable closing expenses to be reimbursed along with a copy of your closing statement (HUD-1 Form) to your Consultant.
Reasonable and customary closing costs which are excludable from your income taxes will be grossed-up. Mortgage origination fees, for example, are deductible and are therefore not grossed-up for tax impact.

If you decide to build a home
If you choose to build a home rather than buy an existing one, separate closings may be required to obtain a construction loan and then convert the construction loan to a permanent mortgage. The Company will not reimburse you for duplicate closing costs that may result from two closings.
In addition, since building a residence often takes longer, you should be aware that temporary living and storage of household goods are not extended for those choosing to build.

Mortgage Assistance
MeadWestvaco has established agreements with Bank of America, GMAC Mortgage and Wells Fargo to assist you if you are purchasing a home in your new location. Your use of these lenders is optional, but as a relocating employee there are several benefits that you may want to consider:
 
 
 
 
 
 
You can contact these three mortgage companies by calling them directly at the number below or you can look up their information on MyGMACRelocation.com. If you call, please identify yourself as a MeadWestvaco transferee and let them know which Consultant at GMAC GRS that you are working with.
Bank of America 800-809-0228
GMAC Mortgage 800-462-2684
Wells Fargo 800-525-3902
The decision of which mortgage lender to use is your ownHowever, if you choose a lender other than one of these three, please be aware that the direct bill service will not be available.
.
Mortgage Interest Differential
You should make every effort to obtain the lowest mortgage interest rate possible on your new residence. If your new interest rate is 1% or higher than your old mortgage interest rate, then the Company will pay, based upon further criteria, the allowed difference above a 1% threshold / differential over a three year period. The differential formula is the interest rate differential between the old and new interest rates less one percent, times the new first mortgage balance.
To qualify for this benefit, you must reinvest at least 90% of the equity in your former home as a down payment and utilize an identical mortgage product as you had in old residence. In addition, your new first mortgage interest rate must be in excess of 7%.

YOUR NEW LOCATION
Home Purchase Assistance - continued
The payout will be for a three-year period on a graduated scale. The first annual amount is 100%. It will be paid shortly after you have closed on your new home. The second payment will be at 66% of the initial differential amount and third year will be set at 33%. These annual payments will be made by GMAC GRS after you have submitted the necessary documentation. An adjustable rate mortgage, a refinance or another transfer during this three year time frame may cancel or amend your payment amount. The purpose of this provision is not to cover the total difference in interest rates but to help you adjust to higher mortgage interest payments.

Duplicate Housing Expenses
If you close on your new home before you complete the sale of your former home, you may be faced with the expense of temporarily maintaining two homes. You will be reimbursed for qualified duplicate housing expenses on your former home for a period not to exceed 180 days.
You must fully participate in the Home Sale Program in order to be eligible for reimbursement of qualified duplicate housing expenses. Reimbursements will apply to your former home only.
Qualified expenses include:
 
 
 
 
Tax gross-up will be provided for non-deductible duplicate housing expenses.
The Company will not provide tax assistance for property taxes and mortgage interest, as these expenses are tax deductible.
Cost of Living Differential Assistance
MeadWestvaco recognizes that the cost of living may vary significantly among different company locations. To assist with the transition to a company location that has substantially higher cost of living than your present area, MeadWestvaco will provide a cost of living subsidy. The subsidy is offered to you as two options: (1) you may elect to receive a mortgage subsidy paid by MeadWestvaco directly to a company-arranged national lender or (2) you may elect to receive your subsidy as monthly payments through payroll. The subsidy is subject to required income tax withholding. Depending on the cost differential, you may be eligible for a 2, 3, 4, or 5 year subsidy.
The benefit to you of a mortgage subsidy is the ability to qualify for a greater mortgage amount than your income might otherwise permit. The mortgage subsidy allows you to qualify for a higher mortgage by reducing the initial interest rate. The result is more purchasing power to assist with the affordability of the new destination area.
For example if the current mortgage interest rate is 7.25% and the first year subsidy results in a 3% reduction in rate, you are qualified by the lender as though the market interest rate were 4.25%. A further benefit is that, at tax time, you may be able to deduct mortgage interest at the note rate of 7.25%. The mortgage interest you pay will increase each year as the subsidy paid to the lender is reduced each year by 1% until you are paying the full note rate in the year that the subsidy ceases.

Subsidy Calculation
GMAC GRS will use an overall cost-of-living index developed by a mobility consulting firm. This index will be calculated on your present and final permanent housing locations. A Cost of Living Differential will be provided when the index is at least 5.1% higher in the new location than in the old location. The subsidy calculation will be based upon a fully amortized loan, including principal and interest payments, regardless of the specific loan product you select. For instance, if you selected an interest only loan, your subsidy calculation will be based as if your mortgage loan is fully amortized having both principal and interest payments versus an interest only payment."
Index
 
 
 
 
 
Examples
A 2-year subsidy reduces the interest rate on the mortgage 2% the first year and 1% the second year. The payment and interest rate during the third and all succeeding years will be at the note rate. If the note rate is 7.25%, the subsidy will reduce the rate to 5.25% for the first year and 6.25% the second year. In the third year, the note rate of 7.25% would apply.
A 3-year subsidy reduces the interest rate on your mortgage 3% the first year, 2% the second year, and 1% the third year. The payment and interest rate during the fourth and all succeeding years will be at the note rate. If the note rate is 7.25%, the subsidy will reduce the rate to 4.25% for the first year, 5.25% the second year and 6.25% the third year. In the fourth year, the note rate of 7.25% would apply.
A 4-year subsidy reduces the interest rate on your mortgage 4% the first year, 3% the second year, 2% the third year, and 1% in the fourth year. The payment and interest rate during the fifth and all succeeding years will be at the note rate. If the note rate is 7.25%, the subsidy will reduce the rate to 3.25% for the first year, 4.25% the second year, 5.25% the third year, and 6.25% the fifth year. In the fifth year, the note rate of 7.25% would apply.

A 5-year subsidy reduces the interest rate on your mortgage 5% the first year, 4% the second year, 3% the third year, and 2% in the fourth year, and 1% in the fifth year. The payment and interest rate during the sixth and all succeeding years will be at the note rate. If the note rate is 7.25%, the subsidy will reduce the rate to 2.25% for the first year, 3.25% the second year, 4.25% the third year, and 5.25% the fourth year, and 6.25% in the fifth year. In the sixth year, the note rate of 7.25% would apply.
Monthly Payment
If you are eligible, you will receive a monthly mortgage subsidy payment through payroll. Required income taxes will be withheld each month.
To determine your eligibility and how the cost of living differential assistance will apply to your specific situation, please contact your Consultant.
Termination and Subsequent Transfer
Subsidy payments will cease upon termination of employment, except in cases of involuntary termination, (not for cause), in which case the mortgage subsidy would continue for the period of benefits continuation, as outlined in the Severance Pay Plan.
If you are transferred while receiving a subsidy, the subsidy will continue while you are responsible for your current home until it is sold or acquired under the company's Employee Relocation Policy as part of your transfer. If you should elect to keep your home at the old location, the subsidy will cease upon the effective date of your transfer to the new location. If you purchase a home at the new location, a new cost of living index will be calculated.

TAX ASSISTANCE
Certain payments that you receive under this policy as reimbursements for relocation expenses may be subject to Federal and State income tax and also social security taxes. In general, these amounts will be the ones that are not deductible for Federal income tax purposes; and when the Company prepares your Form W-2 at year end, these payments will be included in your gross income.
In order to prevent the relocation from creating additional tax burdens for you, the Company calculates an approximation of what the Federal, State and FICA taxes caused by these non-deductible reimbursements will be, including the additional taxes on these amounts. This calculation is often called a "tax gross-up". Then the Company deposits the calculated taxes with the respective governments on your behalf as part of the withholding taxes that you are credited with on your Form W-2.
Because of the complexity involved in the calculations, certain procedures are applied. For example, the tax gross-up is based on the state to which you are transferring; not on the taxes in the state in which you currently reside. Also, the income tax adjustment is calculated as if your MeadWestvaco salary is your family's only income that year. It does not take into account investment income or spousal income that may subject you to a higher tax bracket.
As you know, all employees are responsible for paying FICA taxes based on their MeadWestvaco compensation until the FICA limit is reached in any one year. If as a result of relocation expenses and gross-up, you reach your FICA limit earlier in the year than you would have without these reimbursements, the policy provides that you are still responsible for all the FICA taxes that you would have paid. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that you increase your federal withholding during the period of time you receive any MeadWestvaco compensation that is no longer subject to the FICA liability, but would have been. This is because the Payroll Department cannot withhold the additional amounts on its own initiative.
By January 31 of the year following your relocation, MeadWestvaco and GMAC GRS will forward to you the necessary tax information and instructions for reporting relocation reimbursements on income tax returns. It is your responsibility to notify your Consultant of your new home address. .
If you fail to notify GMAC GRS of your new home address, an unnecessary delay in receiving your tax forms and information may result
