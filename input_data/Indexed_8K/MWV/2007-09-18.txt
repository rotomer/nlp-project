Exhibit 99.1
 
RICHMOND, VA., September 18, 2007  MeadWestvaco (NYSE: MWV) announced today at the UBS Global Paper and Forest Products Conference that it is considering alternative ownership structures for its Community Development & Land Management Group.
MeadWestvaco created the Community Development & Land Management Group earlier this year to maximize the value of the company's forestland holdings for shareholders. This business has now completed the first phase of the company's land management strategy, which included segmentation of the U.S. land holdings and the sale of 290,000 acres of owned forestland and 95,000 acres of leased forestland for $493.1 million. MeadWestvaco intends to return the value obtained to shareholders. The company is pursuing significant value creation opportunities, such as uses for recreation, conservation and development, on its remaining 800,000 acres of forestland across the southeastern U.S.
"As we continue to execute our land management strategy and build this business, we will explore alternate ownership structures that best support our business objectives and provide the greatest value to our shareholders," said John A. Luke, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Our Board of Directors strongly supports our strategy, and believes that any alternative structure must recognize that successful implementation of the business plan will require continuity of vision and leadership, as well as community engagement and support."
MeadWestvaco's study of alternate ownership structures is expected to be completed by the second half of 2008, and will include analysis of valuation, tax implications, legal and regulatory requirements, and market conditions. The company expects to be in a position to implement any decision within two to three years.
