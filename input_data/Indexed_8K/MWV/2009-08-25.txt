This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: August 24, 2009
     
Indenture.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2002 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, ini tially limited in aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series, issue additional Securities having the same ranking, interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Securities of this series. Any additional Securities so issued, together with the Securities of this series, will constitute a single series of Securities under the Indenture.
     
Optional Redemption
. Upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Company may redeem this Security, in whole or in part (in integral multiples of $1,000), at any time at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount hereof plus the Make-Whole Premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest hereon, if any, to the Redemption Date. Notice of redemption will be given as provided in the Indenture.
     
For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a redemption at the option of the Company, the following definitions are applicable:
     
"Make-Whole Premium" means, with respect to any Security at any Redemption Date, the excess, if any, of (a) the present value of the sum of the principal amount and premium, if any, that would be payable on such Security on its Stated Maturity and all remaining interest payments (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) to and including such Stated Maturity, discounted on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis from such Stated Maturity to the Redemption Date at a per annum interest rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Yield (determined on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date), plus 60 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of the Security being redeemed.
     
"Treasury Yield" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled by and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) which has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the date fixed for redemption (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar data)) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life of the Securities of this series, provided that if the average life of the Securities of this series is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury yield shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yield i s given, except that if the average life of the Securities of this series is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
     
Events of Default.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     
Change of Control Offer
. If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, then the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase all, or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof), of each Holder's Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"), subject to the rights of Holders of Securities on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date.
     
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Company will be required to mail a notice to Holders of Securities by first class mail describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required herein and described in such notice. If the notice is mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, the notice will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
     
The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable, in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions herein, the Company will be required to comply with those applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions herein by virtue of such conflicts.
     
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will be required, to the extent lawful, to:
     
(a) accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered, and not validly withdrawn, pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
     
(b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered and not validly withdrawn; and
     
(c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being purchased by the Company.
     
The Paying Agent will promptly mail (but in any case not later than five Business Days after the Change of Control Payment Date) to each Holder of Securities properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Securities surrendered, if any. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
     
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect the Securities (i) upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer or (ii) if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture.

     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
     
(a) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Company's Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries;
     
(b) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's then outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares;
     
(c) the first day on which a majority of the Company's members of its board of directors are not Continuing Directors; or
     (d) the adoption of a plan relating to the Company's liquidation or dissolution.
