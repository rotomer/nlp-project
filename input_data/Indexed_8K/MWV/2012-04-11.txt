Use of Non-GAAP Measures
The presentation of income from continuing operations before income taxes shown on page four of this document, adjusted to exclude the effects of the items listed below and labeled as "Adjusted EBIT" and "Adjusted EBIT Margin", is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes and its related margin determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

The effects of these items on income from continuing operations before income taxes determined in accordance with GAAP and presented as Adjusted EBIT on page four of this document are as follows:
 
In addition, the presentation of "EBITDA" and "EBITDA Margin" included in the segment discussions is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for segment EBIT and segment EBIT margin determined in accordance with GAAP.
