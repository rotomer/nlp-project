PITTSBURGH, PA - May 8, 2003 - Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) announced today financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended March 31, 2003, which included record results for both periods. Net revenues for the fiscal year increased 15% to a record $1.27 billion from $1.10 billion in the prior year. Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 25% to a record $353.7 million from $282.6 million for the same prior year period.
Net earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, increased 5% to $272.4 million from $260.3 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2003 were $1.45 per share compared to $1.36 in fiscal 2002, an increase of 7%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $73.8 million compared to $67.3 million for the same prior year period, an increase of 10%. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $.40 per share in the current quarter from $.35 per share.
"2003 was a milestone year in terms of revenue and earnings for Mylan," commented Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our generic business continued its strong growth, exceeding one billion in sales for the first time ever. At the same time, Bertek Pharmaceuticals, our branded business, successfully launched a significant new product and continued to grow its existing core products."
Net revenues for Mylan's Generic Segment were $1.01 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $971.1 million in fiscal 2002, an increase of $41.5 million or 4%. The increase in net revenues was achieved despite the expiration of exclusivity on buspirone in March 2002, which contributed net revenues of $167.7 million in fiscal 2002. Excluding sales of buspirone in both periods, net revenues in fiscal 2003 would have increased 24% over the prior fiscal year.
The Brand Segment reported record net revenues of $256.6 million compared to $133.0 million in fiscal 2002, an increase of $123.6 million or 93%. The increase in net revenues is attributable to the launch of Amnesteem(R) and the growth of existing products including Digitek(R), phenytoin and Avita(R). Amnesteem was launched late in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, and contributed net revenues of $61.2 million for the fiscal year.
The fourth quarter and fiscal 2003 results included the resolution of three legal matters which in the aggregate did not significantly impact Mylan's financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, Mylan announced that it had reached an agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb to resolve all outstanding disputes between the companies involving buspirone and paclitaxel. As part of the settlement, Mylan received a one-time payment of $35.0 million. In March 2003, Mylan reached a tentative settlement of a class action lawsuit concerning Mylan's 1998 lorazepam and clorazepate anti-trust litigation and received an arbitration decision in a dispute involving verapamil. The anti-trust settlement was for $35.0 million, of which Mylan is responsible for up to $27.9 million, with the remainder to be paid by the other co-defendants. The $27.9 million, along with $4.2 million plus interest to be paid as a result of the verapamil arbitration, was included in expense in the current quarter. The net effect of the resolution of these three legal matters was a gain of $2.4 million during the quarter.
"We are pleased to have resolved these outstanding legal matters as we begin our next fiscal year," stated Mr. Coury. "In addition, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2003, we reached a tentative agreement to receive an additional $10.0 million from the other co-defendants, further reducing our $27.9 million liability under the lorazepam and clorazepate litigation."
 
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, increased 4% or $41.5 million to $1.01 billion from $971.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2003 was realized despite the loss of exclusivity on buspirone. During the prior year, the Company had market exclusivity with respect to buspirone 15mg and 30mg. Following the expiration of such exclusivity, which occurred in March 2002, buspirone experienced price and volume erosion which is considered normal in the generic industry. Excluding revenue from buspirone, net revenues for fiscal 2003 increased $188.9 million or 24%, due to new products launched during the fiscal year, as well as increased volume and favorable pricing on existing products. New products accounted for $79.5 million, or approximately 42% of the increase in net revenues excluding buspirone, with the remaining increase attributable to growth from the Company's existing product portfolio.
Gross profit for fiscal 2003 decreased $21.6 million to $531.1 million from $552.7 million, primarily attributable to the lower gross profit related to buspirone. Earnings from operations for fiscal 2003 were $454.0 million compared to $483.1 million for the prior year, a decrease of 6% or $29.0 million. The decrease in earnings from operations was driven primarily by the lower gross profit and an increase in research and development expenses. The increase in research and development expense was the result of an increase in clinical studies being performed to expand the development platform.
 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $248.8 million from $247.1 million for the same prior year period. Excluding revenue from buspirone, net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 increased $43.9 million or 22%. The increase was primarily attributable to new products launched in fiscal 2003, which contributed revenues of $30.3 million.
Gross profit for the quarter decreased $7.6 million to $135.0 million from $142.6 million which was primarily attributable to lower gross profit related to buspirone. Earnings from operations were $114.3 million for the quarter compared to $126.6 million for the prior year quarter, a decrease of 10% or $12.3 million. The lower earnings from operations were primarily a result of the lower gross profit along with an increase in research and development expenses.
Brand Segment
For fiscal 2003, the Brand Segment reported net revenues of $256.6 million, an increase of 93% or $123.6 million from $133.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in net revenues was the result of the launch of Amnesteem and growth in the Company's existing portfolio of products including Digitek, phenytoin and Avita. Gross profit for fiscal 2003 increased $69.1 million or 97% to $140.3 million from $71.2 million. Earnings from operations were $32.7 million compared to a loss from operations of $16.2 million in the prior year.
Brand Segment operating expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 23% or $20.2 million to $107.6 million from $87.4 million. The increase was attributable to higher research and development expenses due to ongoing clinical studies related to nebivolol, and increased selling and marketing expenses related to the launch of Amnesteem. These increases were partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.
The Brand Segment realized record net revenues for the current quarter of $104.9 million, an increase of $69.4 million. The launch of Amnesteem accounted for approximately 67% of the increase in net revenues, while existing products continued to grow. As a result of the increase in net revenues, gross profit for the fourth quarter increased $34.2 million to $52.5 million.
Earnings from operations for the fourth quarter were $21.2 million compared to $0.3 million for the same prior year period. The increase was the result of higher gross profit, partially offset by increased operating expenses, primarily research and development. Research and development expenses increased $11.1 million as a result of clinical studies related primarily to nebivolol.
Corporate/Other Segment
General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003 were $75.1 million, an increase of $3.4 million from the prior year. Other income for fiscal 2003 was $12.5 million compared to $13.1 million in the prior year. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 increased $11.0 million to $26.3 million, primarily due to increased legal costs associated with the litigation settlements previously discussed. Other income increased $11.5 million to $5.2 million for the current quarter versus $6.3 million of expense in the prior year. This increase was due to the performance of investments accounted for under the equity method, as well as realized gains from the sale of certain marketable securities.
