EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR: Mylan Laboratories Inc. For Further Information 1500 Corporate Dr., Suite 400 CONTACT: Kris King Canonsburg, PA 15317 (724) 514-1800 MYLAN UPDATES LITIGATION STATUS Pittsburgh, PA - October 10, 2003 - Earlier this week, Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE:MYL) reported it had been dismissed with prejudice from the consolidated, multi-district "Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation" in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The dismissal was granted after presentation of Mylan's unopposed motion to dismiss. Today Mylan learned the judge in the case vacated the order, "in light of the scheduling order entered on September 2, 2003." Copies of the orders have been filed by the Company in a Form 8-K and are available through EDGAR. Vice Chairman and CEO Robert J. Coury stated: "It appears as if this action was taken by the judge on her own initiative because she became aware of a scheduling inconsistency relating to one of her previous orders. So far as we know, in the approximately two weeks since the entry of the order, no party objected to the entry of the original order dismissing Mylan or asked the court to reconsider the dismissal. We are hopeful that we will be in the same place when the scheduling issue is resolved." Mylan Laboratories Inc. is a leading pharmaceutical company with four subsidiaries, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan Technologies Inc., UDL Laboratories Inc. and Bertek Pharmaceuticals Inc., that develop, manufacture and market an extensive line of generic and proprietary products.
