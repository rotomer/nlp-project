Quarterly Financial Highlights
PITTSBURGH, PA  October 29, 2003  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended September 30, 2003, which included record diluted earnings per share, net revenues and net earnings. The quarter was driven by a strong performance from the Generic Segment which contributed net revenues of $299.5 million, a record quarter for that segment, as well as improved results from the Brand Segment. Overall, revenues for the second quarter increased 13% to $360.1 million from $319.5 million a year ago.
Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.33 compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of fiscal 2003, an increase of 38%. For the six months ended September 30, 2003, diluted earnings per share were $0.63 compared to $0.46 in the same prior year period, an increase of 37%. Included in the results for the six months ended September 30, 2003 are gains on legal settlements which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.05 per diluted share. All share and per share amounts in this press release have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split which was effected on October 8, 2003.
Net earnings for the quarter increased 34% to $91.3 million from $68.2 million in the same prior year period. For the six months, net earnings increased 35% to $175.1 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $130.1 million in fiscal 2003.
"We achieved the best quarter in the Company's history," commented Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Clearly the strength of the quarter was driven by our Generic business and the recent launch of omeprazole. While omeprazole has been a focus of recent attention, it is just one of a number of opportunities that we see contributing to our current and future success, and is a continuation of our commitment to bring to the market quality and affordable products."
 
Second quarter net revenues for the Generic Segment increased 9% or $25.2 million, which included $68.6 million from products launched subsequent to September 30, 2002, largely due to omeprazole. Brand Segment net revenues for the second quarter were $60.6 million, an increase of 34% or $15.3 million from the same prior year period.
For the six months ended September 30, 2003, net revenues increased 16% or $96.5 million to $691.5 million from $595.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2002. Generic Segment revenues were $554.7 million, an increase of 9% over the same prior year period, while Brand Segment revenues increased 61% to $136.8 million.
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the quarter increased 9% or $25.2 million to $299.5 million from $274.3 million for the same prior year period. This increase is the result of $68.6 million from products launched subsequent to September 30, 2002, largely due to omeprazole, offset in part by changes in the portfolio mix.
Gross profit for the quarter increased $29.3 million to $169.2 million from $139.9 million, while earnings from operations increased $26.4 million to $147.1 million from $120.7 million in the same prior year period. The increase in earnings from operations was driven primarily by the higher gross profit, partially offset by increased research and development expense from the continued expansion of the development platform.
For the six months ended September 30, 2003, net revenues increased $44.8 million or 9% to $554.7 million from $509.9 million. New products launched subsequent to September 30, 2002 contributed net revenues of $74.4 million.
Gross profit for the year-to-date period was $307.7 million compared to $264.4 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $43.3 million. Operating income for the six month period increased by 17% or $37.6 million to $264.7 million from $227.1 million. The increase in operating income was driven by the increased gross profit partially offset by higher research and development expenses.
Brand Segment
For the second quarter, the Brand Segment reported net revenues of $60.6 million, an increase of 34% or $15.3 million from $45.3 million in the same prior year period. Over 50% of the increase in Brand Segment net revenues resulted from Amnesteem, which
 
was launched in late fiscal 2003, with the remainder attributable to growth in the existing portfolio of products. Gross profit for the second quarter increased $11.6 million or 43% to $38.5 million from $26.9 million.
Earnings from operations were $11.7 million compared to $1.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit.
For the six months ended September 30, 2003, net revenues increased 61% or $51.7 million to $136.8 million from $85.1 million. Amnesteem accounted for approximately 70% of this increase. The remainder of the increase was the result of continued growth in the existing product portfolio.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was $77.5 million, an increase of $27.5 million or 55% from $50.0 million in fiscal 2003. Earnings from operations were $21.5 million compared to $0.7 million. The improvement in earnings from operations was the result of increased gross profit partially offset by higher research and development expenses, primarily due to on-going studies related to nebivolol.
Corporate/Other
General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $24.7 million, an increase of $7.8 million from the same prior year period. For the six months ended September 30, 2003, general and administrative expenses were $46.7 million, an increase of $18.6 million from the same prior year period. The increases for both the three and six month periods were primarily due to increased legal costs and other costs related to the Company's continued investment in its infrastructure.
Other income for the second quarter was $7.4 million which included a gain of $5.0 million on the sale of an office building. For the year-to-date period, other income was $10.5 million compared to $3.6 million in fiscal 2003.
