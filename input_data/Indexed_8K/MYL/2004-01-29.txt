Quarterly Financial Highlights
PITTSBURGH, PA  January 29, 2004  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced its fiscal 2005 earnings guidance of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share. "We are pleased to once again deliver guidance which projects continued earnings growth as we continue to invest heavily in our business for our future," stated Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and CEO. "Our guidance demonstrates our continued commitment to effectively manage our business while delivering growth to our shareholders."
Mylan today also announced its financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2003, which included third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.31, net revenues of $349.8 million and net earnings of $84.6 million, all third quarter records.
For the three months ended December 31, 2003, net revenues increased 9% to a third quarter record $349.8 million, with increases realized by both the Generic Segment and the Brand Segment. Net revenues for the Generic Segment increased 9% or $23.6 million to $277.4 million, while Brand Segment net revenues were $72.3 million, an increase of 9% or $5.7 million from the same prior year period. For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, net revenues increased 14% or $125.7 million to $1.04 billion from $915.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. Generic Segment net revenues were $832.2 million, an increase of 9% over the same prior year period, while Brand Segment net revenues increased 38% to $209.1 million.
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.31 compared to $0.24 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003, an increase of 29%. For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, diluted earnings per share were $0.94 compared to $0.70 in the same prior
 
year period, an increase of 34%. Net earnings increased 24% to a third quarter record $84.6 million from $68.4 million in the same prior year period. For the nine months, net earnings increased 31% to $259.8 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $198.5 million in fiscal 2003.
Mylan's fiscal 2005 earnings guidance reflects a continuation of the success achieved to date in fiscal 2004. Financial performance in the pharmaceutical industry is difficult to predict given its regulatory environment, competition within the industry at market formation and throughout a product's life cycle, the increasingly litigious nature of the research and development and product approval process, and other risks associated with Mylan's business. Therefore, when developing Mylan's fiscal 2005 financial guidance, management probability weighs factors which it believes could influence results of operations. For risk factors associated with the Company's business, including future financial performance, please read carefully the Company's most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other periodic SEC filings.
Based upon this approach and analysis, the Company projects its fiscal 2005 earnings per diluted share to be $1.30 to $1.40, with the following expectations of its key business drivers:
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the quarter increased 9% or $23.6 million to $277.4 million from $253.9 million for the same prior year period. This increase is the result of $29.5 million from products launched subsequent to December 31, 2002, largely due to omeprazole, partially offset in part by changes in the portfolio mix.
 
Gross profit for the quarter increased 17% or $21.9 million to $153.6 million, and gross margins increased from 52% to 55% of net revenues. Earnings from operations increased 16% or $17.8 million to $130.4 million from the same prior year period. The increase in earnings from operations was driven primarily by higher gross profit which was partially offset by increased research and development expense from the continued expansion of the development platform.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, net revenues increased $68.3 million or 9% to $832.2 million from $763.8 million. New products launched subsequent to December 31, 2002, contributed net revenues of $102.5 million, largely due to omeprazole.
Gross profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2003, increased 16% or $65.2 million to $461.2 million from fiscal 2003, and gross margins increased from 52% to 55% of net revenues. Operating income for the nine-month period increased by 16% or $55.4 million to $395.1 million from $339.7 million. The increase in operating income was driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher research and development expenses.
Brand Segment
For the third quarter, the Brand Segment reported net revenues of $72.3 million, an increase of 9% or $5.7 million from $66.6 million in the same prior year period. Included in third quarter net revenue is $13.2 million related to the sale of the U.S. and Canadian rights to sertaconazole nitrate 2% cream. Gross profit for the third quarter increased $7.8 million or 20% to $45.6 million, which included this sale.
Earnings from operations were $17.1 million compared to $10.7 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gross profit, partially offset by increased selling and marketing costs due to pre-marketing activities related to apomorphine.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, net revenues increased 38% or $57.4 million to $209.1 million from $151.7 million. This increase was primarily the result of sales of Amnesteem which was launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, as well as the sertaconazole sale.
Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was $123.1 million, an increase of $35.2 million or 40% from $87.8 million in fiscal 2003. Earnings from operations were $38.5 million compared to $11.5 million. The improvement in earnings from operations was the result of increased gross profit partially offset by higher research and development expenses related to nebivolol, and increased selling and marketing costs related to apomorphine pre-marketing activities.
Corporate/Other
General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $24.7 million, an increase of $4.0 million from the same prior year period. For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, general and administrative expenses were $71.4 million, an increase of $22.5 million from the same prior year period. The increases for both the three and nine month periods were due primarily to increased legal costs.
 
Other income for the third quarter and nine-month period was $4.2 million and $14.7 million, respectively. Included in other income for the nine months are interest income and a gain of $5.0 million on the sale of an office building, partially offset by losses realized by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company in which Mylan maintains an equity investment.
Fiscal 2004 Earnings Guidance
Mylan reaffirms its fiscal 2004 earnings guidance of $1.11 to $1.18 per diluted share.
