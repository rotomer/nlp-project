Exhibit 99.1
Annual Financial Highlights
:
PITTSBURGH, PA  May 11, 2004  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, which included record diluted earnings per share of $1.21 for fiscal 2004, record annual revenues of $1.37 billion and record fiscal year earnings of $334.6 million.
Net revenues increased $105.4 million or 8% to $1.37 billion from $1.27 billion in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 increased $0.25 or 26% to $1.21 from fiscal 2003 diluted earnings per share of $0.96, while net earnings for fiscal 2004 increased $62.3 million or 23% to $334.6 million from $272.4 million in the prior year.
Net earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2004 increased 1% to $74.9 million from the same prior year period. Diluted earnings per share were $0.27 for both periods. The current quarter results included net gains on legal settlements which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.02 per diluted share. For the three months ended March 31, 2004, net revenues decreased 6% to $333.4 million. This change reflects a strong fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, which benefited from the launch of Amnesteem late in the third quarter of that year.
"Our financial results were the strongest in our history, and reflect our commitment to achieve average long-term earnings growth of at least 15%," commented Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and CEO of Mylan. "Additionally, we believe that the recently filed NDA for nebivolol, when approved, will provide a strong foundation for our branded business."
Generic Segment net revenues increased 6% or $15.2 million to a fourth quarter record $264.0 million. New products, primarily omeprazole, contributed net revenues of $41.4 million. Generic Segment net revenues for the fiscal year increased 8% to $1.10 billion, also a record for that segment, with new products, primarily omeprazole, contributing net revenues of $134.6 million.
The Brand Segment reported net revenues of $69.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, a decrease of $35.5 million from the same prior year period. Since its launch in late fiscal 2003, Amnesteem revenues have decreased as a result of the entry into the market of additional competition. However, such competition was not significant until after March of 2003. For the fiscal year, Brand Segment net revenues increased 9% or $21.9 million to a record $278.5 million.
 
The fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included net gains of $10.4 million from the settlement of certain litigation. In March 2004, Mylan agreed to settle its claims with respect to mirtazapine in exchange for $15.0 million. Of this amount, approximately $4.8 million represented reimbursement of legal expenses, the majority of which were incurred in the current quarter.
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the quarter increased 6% or $15.2 million to $264.0 million from $248.8 million for the same prior year period. This increase is the result of $41.4 million from products launched subsequent to March 31, 2003, largely due to omeprazole, offset in part by changes in the portfolio mix and lower revenue from certain products as a result of increased competition.
Gross profit for the quarter increased 3% to $139.0 million, resulting in a gross margin of 53%. Earnings from operations increased 1% to $115.7 million, as a result of the increase in gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by higher research and development expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. The increase in research and development expenses is the result of continued investment in our development platform.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, net revenues increased $83.5 million or 8% to $1.10 billion from $1.01 billion in the prior fiscal year. New products launched in fiscal 2004 contributed net revenues of $134.6 million, largely due to omeprazole.
Gross profit for fiscal 2004 increased 13% or $69.2 million to $600.3 million, compared to $531.1 million in fiscal 2003, and gross margins increased from 52% to 55% of net revenues, primarily due to higher margins contributed by new products. Operating income for fiscal 2004 increased 13% or $56.8 million to $510.8 million from $454.0 million. The increase in operating income was driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher research and development expenses as we continue to selectively invest in targeted opportunities for our pipeline.
 
Brand Segment
Brand Segment net revenues for the fourth quarter were $69.4 million, a decrease of $35.5 million from $104.9 million in the same prior year period. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 included approximately $22.6 million more revenue from Amnesteem, which was launched late in the third quarter of the prior year and benefited from limited competition in the prior year fourth quarter. Additionally, Acticin and Maxzide experienced competition in the current quarter, primarily accounting for the remainder of the decrease.
Gross profit for the Brand Segment decreased $13.4 million to $39.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $52.5 million in the same prior year period. Despite this decrease, gross margins increased to 56% from 50% of net revenues. This increase is a result of favorable product mix, including a lower concentration of sales from Amnesteem, which contributes lower gross margins as a result of royalties paid under a supply and distribution agreement. Earnings from operations were $8.0 million compared to $21.2 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease is the result of the lower gross profit, as operating expenses for the quarter were relatively unchanged, with higher selling and marketing costs offset by a decrease in research and development expenses. The increase in selling and marketing relates primarily to pre-marketing activities for the upcoming launch of Apokyn, which has been approved for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, "off" episodes associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. The decrease in research and development expenses is the result of the completion of clinical studies related to nebivolol, for which a NDA was filed on April 30, 2004.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, net revenues increased 9% or $21.9 million to $278.5 million from $256.6 million. Fiscal 2004 benefited from a full year of Amnesteem sales, which amounted to $75.9 million, compared to $61.2 million in fiscal 2003, the year of launch.
Gross profit for fiscal 2004 increased $21.9 million or 16% to $162.2 million from $140.3 million, and gross margins increased to 58% from 55% of net revenues. Earnings from operations were $46.5 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $32.7 million in fiscal 2003. The improvement in earnings from operations was the result of increased gross profit partially offset by higher selling and marketing costs related primarily to Apokyn pre-marketing activities.
Corporate/Other
General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $25.9 million compared to $26.3 million in the same prior year period. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, general and administrative expenses were $97.3 million, an increase of $22.2 million from the same prior year period. The increase is primarily the result of increased legal costs.
Other income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year was $3.1 million and $17.8 million, respectively. Included in other income for fiscal 2004 are interest income, gains on the sale of marketable securities and a gain of $5.0 million on the sale of an office building. These income items were partially offset by losses realized by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company in which Mylan maintains an equity investment.
 
Fiscal 2005 Earnings Guidance
Mylan reaffirms its fiscal 2005 earnings guidance of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share, which anticipates a July 24, 2004 launch of fentanyl.
