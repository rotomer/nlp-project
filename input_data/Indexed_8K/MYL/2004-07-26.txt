Financial Highlights
:
PITTSBURGH, PA  July 26, 2004  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended June 30, 2004, which included record first quarter net revenues of $339.0 million. This represents an increase of $7.6 million over net revenues from the same prior year period.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $0.30 per share, which is the same as was reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Net earnings for the three months decreased slightly to $82.0 million from $83.9 million in the same prior year period.
Included in net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were net gains on legal settlements which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.06 per diluted share. Net gains on legal settlements of approximately $0.05 per diluted share were included in net earnings in the first quarter of the prior year.
"We are pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005," commented Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and CEO of Mylan. "Our branded franchise, which will be augmented by our acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, will complement our generics business which has been, and continues to be, under increasing pressure due to uncertainties caused by recent decisions from the FDA, current brand tactics and other factors that are beyond our control."
Earlier today, Mylan announced in a separate press release that it has entered into an agreement to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
From a segment perspective, Generic Segment net revenues increased 5% or $12.5 million to $267.7 million, a first quarter record. The Brand Segment reported net revenues of $71.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, a decrease of $4.9 million or 6% from the same prior year period. The Brand Segment reported first quarter increases in both gross profit and gross margins despite the decrease in net revenues.
 
The first quarter of fiscal 2005 included net gains of $26.0 million from litigation settlements. In June 2004, Mylan received $37.5 million in settlement of certain patent litigation claims involving omeprazole. A portion of this settlement represented reimbursement of legal fees and expenses related to the litigation. Partially offsetting this gain, Mylan agreed, also in June 2004, to a $9.0 million settlement resolving all pending litigation with respect to paclitaxel.
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the quarter increased 5% or $12.5 million to $267.7 million from $255.2 million for the same prior year period. Contributing to this increase is net revenue from products launched subsequent to June 30, 2003 of $41.8 million. Included in this amount are sales of omeprazole, which was launched in August 2003, and levothyroxine sodium tablets, which were approved as the generic version of Abbott Laboratories' Synthroid in late June 2004. Mylan had previously marketed levothyroxine sodium tablets as the generic equivalent of Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals' Unithroid.
Gross profit for the quarter was relatively constant at $138.8 million, while gross margins decreased from 54.2% in fiscal 2004 to 51.9% in fiscal 2005. Earnings from operations decreased 3% to $113.7 million, as a result of increased research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. R&D expenses increased by 21% to $16.3 million as a result of continued investment in our development platform. G&A expenses increased to $5.9 million.
Brand Segment
Brand Segment net revenues for the first quarter were $71.3 million, a decrease of $4.9 million or 6% from $76.2 million in the same prior year period. The majority of the decrease in net revenues was due to lower sales of Amnesteem and Digitek, partially offset by increased sales of phenytoin.
Gross profit for the Brand Segment increased 5% or $2.0 million to $40.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, while gross margins increased to 57.4% from 51.2%. The increase was a result of a favorable product mix, primarily a lower concentration of sales from Amnesteem, which contributed lower gross margins as a result of royalties paid under a supply and distribution agreement.
Earnings from operations were $16.3 million compared to $9.7 million in the same
 
quarter of the prior year, an increase of $6.5 million or 67%. This increase was the result of the higher gross profit and lower operating expenses. R&D expenses decreased by $6.0 million or 54% from the same prior year period, partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $1.5 million or 10%. The decrease in R&D expenses was the result of the completion of clinical studies related to nebivolol, for which an NDA was filed on April 30, 2004.
Corporate/Other
G&A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $29.4 million compared to $22.0 million in the same prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of increased legal costs.
Other income for the first quarter was $0.7 million compared to $3.1 million in the same prior year period.
