Exhibit 99.1
PITTSBURGH, PA  October 28, 2004  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended September 30, 2004. Mylan also reported that it is currently assessing certain disclosures in King Pharmaceuticals' earnings release relating to returns reserves, which King indicated could lead to a restatement of its financial statements. Although a restatement would result in a failure to satisfy a condition to close the pending Mylan-King transaction, the Company has made no decisions and intends to evaluate the issue as additional information becomes available.
In light of King's disclosures, however, Mylan has postponed its previously announced investor presentation and webcast scheduled for November 1st, and will update investors when appropriate.
Second Quarter 2005 Results; Fiscal Year 2005 Guidance
Net revenues for the quarter were $307.0 million, a decrease of $53.1 million from the same prior year period. Net earnings were $48.7 million, a decrease of $42.6 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2004, while earnings per diluted share were $0.18 compared to $0.33 in the same prior year period.
"As we pre-announced on October 21, 2004, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by numerous factors, including additional entrants into the omeprazole market since the time of our launch, the emergence of competition in the carbidopa/levodopa market, the launch of an authorized generic' for nitrofurantoin during our 180-day exclusivity period, the delay in the launch of our fentanyl product and regulatory action surrounding levothyroxine sodium," commented Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "The quarter was also negatively impacted by a lack of new significant product launches. However, we are continuing to invest heavily in R&D as evidenced by the growing number of ANDA filings that we have or will have before the FDA."
Mylan also today issued revised earnings guidance for fiscal 2005 of $0.80 to $0.90 per diluted share, including net gains on legal settlements in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.06 per diluted share. This guidance assumes a January 24, 2005 launch of fentanyl with at least one competitor in the market. Mylan had previously suspended its earnings guidance in June 2004 in response to certain FDA rulings, including its fentanyl decision, and issues facing the generic pharmaceutical industry, such as the practice of "authorized generics".
Generic Segment net revenues for the second quarter decreased $52.0 million to $247.5 million, while Brand Segment net revenues of $59.4 million declined $1.1 million from the same prior year period.
For the first six months of fiscal 2005, Mylan reported net revenues of $646.0 million, a decrease of $45.5 million from the same prior year period. Net earnings and earnings per diluted share decreased to $130.7 million and $0.48 per share, respectively, from $175.1 million and $0.63 per share, respectively, in the prior year. The first six months of fiscal 2005 included net gains on legal settlements which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.06 per diluted share. This compares to $0.05 per diluted share attributed to gains on legal settlements in the first six months of fiscal 2004.
 
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the quarter decreased $52.0 million to $247.5 million from $299.5 million for the same prior year period. This decrease is primarily the result of lower sales of omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa, both of which decreased as a result of additional generic competition. The prior year results included net revenues of $68.6 million from the launch of new products, largely due to omeprazole, which was launched in August 2003. New products contributed net revenues of $9.9 million in the current quarter.
Gross profit for the quarter decreased $48.1 million to $121.1 million, while gross margins decreased to 48.9% from 56.5%. The impact of competition on the pricing of omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa was primarily responsible for the decrease in margins. Earnings from operations decreased $51.6 million to $95.5 million primarily as a result of the decrease in gross profit. Additionally, the Generic Segment's operating expenses increased $3.5 million, primarily as a result of additional research and development (R&D) expenses.
For the six-month period, net revenues decreased by $39.5 million to $515.2 million from $554.7 million in the same prior year period. The decreases discussed above with respect to omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa were primarily responsible for the year-to-date decline in sales. New products in the current fiscal year contributed net revenues of $26.1 million compared to $74.4 million in fiscal 2004.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2005 was $259.9 million, a decrease of $47.8 million from the first six months of fiscal 2004. Gross margins decreased to 50.4% in the current year compared to 55.5% in the prior year. Unfavorable pricing on several products, including omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa as a result of the competition discussed above, contributed to the lower margins.
Operating income decreased $55.4 million to $209.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2004. This decrease was the result of lower gross profit as well as higher R&D and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. R&D expenses increased as a result of the continued investment in our generic development platform.
 
Brand Segment
Brand Segment net revenues for the second quarter were $59.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from $60.6 million in the same prior year period. Brand Segment gross profit decreased $4.3 million to $34.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, while gross margins decreased to 57.5% from 63.5% in the same prior year period. The decrease in margin is primarily the result of increased competition on certain brand products, primarily Digitek and Acticin.
Earnings from operations were $8.4 million compared to $11.7 million in the same quarter of the prior year, a decrease of $3.4 million. This decrease was the result of the lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
For the six months ended September 30, 2004, Brand Segment net revenues decreased $6.0 million to $130.8 million from $136.8 million in the prior year. Increased generic competition on certain branded products, such as Amnesteem, Digitek and Acticin, contributed to the decline in sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues from phenytoin and Phenytek.
Gross profit for the Brand Segment decreased $2.4 million to $75.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2005. Despite the decrease in net revenues and gross profit, gross margins actually increased to 57.5% in the current period from 56.6% in the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of favorable product mix, with phenytoin comprising a higher percentage of sales, and Amnesteem, which contributes lower gross margins as a result of royalties paid under a supply and distribution agreement, comprising a smaller percentage.
Operating income for the six months ended September 30, 2004 was $24.6 million, an increase of $3.2 million from the same prior year period. This increase was the result of lower overall operating expenses which offset the impact of the decrease in gross profit.
Corporate/Other
G&A expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $30.4 million compared to $24.7 million in the same prior year period. The increase was primarily the result of certain costs associated with the planned acquisition and integration of King and the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Other income for the second quarter was $1.9 million compared to $7.4 million in the same prior year period. Included in the prior year was a gain of $5.0 million on the sale of an office building.
For the six months ended September 30, 2004, G&A expenses increased $13.1 million to $59.8 million. This increase was the result of higher payroll and payroll related costs, as well as increased legal and professional fees. Other income for the period was $2.6 million compared to $10.5 million in the same prior year period.
