EXHIBIT 99.1
PITTSBURGH, PA  February 3, 2005  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) announced its financial results for the third quarter ended December 31, 2004. Net revenues for the quarter were $291.0 million, a decrease of $58.8 million from the same prior year period. Net earnings were $34.8 million, a decrease of $49.8 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2004, while earnings per diluted share were $0.13 compared to $0.31 in the same prior year period.
"As I have previously stated, the generic industry continues to be under significant pressure," commented Robert J. Coury, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have experienced increased pressure on pricing due to overall market conditions and additional competition on certain products, most notably omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa. This, coupled with the impact of authorized generics, the delay in the launch of our fentanyl transdermal system and limited new significant product launches, has continued to negatively affect our financial results."
Mylan also today issued revised earnings guidance for fiscal 2005 of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share, including net gains on legal settlements in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.06 per diluted share. The Company's revised guidance primarily reflects what we believe to be irrational pricing of fentanyl at market formation.
Mr. Coury further stated, "Mylan continues to demonstrate its leadership ability in bringing to market products that are difficult to both manufacture and develop and will continue to focus on and select future opportunities that meet these criteria. Once again we've achieved another Mylan first by becoming the first company to bring to market a class II AB-rated transdermal fentanyl product. Mylan and the generic industry, throughout their history, have weathered a number of cyclical downturns and we believe, as in the past, that Mylan will once again emerge from the current environment even stronger than before."
For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, Mylan reported net revenues of $936.9 million, a decrease of $104.3 million from the same prior year period. Net earnings and earnings per diluted share decreased to $165.5 million and $0.60 per diluted share, respectively, from $259.8 million and $0.94 per diluted share, respectively, in the prior year. The results for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 included net gains on legal settlements which amounted, net of tax, to approximately $0.06 per diluted share.
 
Generic Segment
Net revenues for the quarter decreased $39.1 million to $238.4 million from $277.4 million for the same prior year period. Overall unfavorable pricing, including price erosion as a result of increased competition, negatively impacted the Company's product portfolio, with carbidopa/levodopa being the product most affected. Omeprazole, which was launched in August 2003, has also experienced decreased pricing as a result of competition. However, increased volume on omeprazole nearly offset the impact of the unfavorable pricing.
New products contributed net revenues of $11.8 million in the current quarter. The prior year results included net revenues of $29.5 million from the launch of new products, largely due to omeprazole.
Gross profit for the quarter decreased $46.3 million to $107.2 million, while gross margins decreased to 45.0% from 55.4%. The impact of competition on the pricing of omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa, as well as other products in the Company's portfolio, was primarily responsible for the decrease in margins. Earnings from operations decreased $50.5 million to $80.0 million primarily as a result of the decrease in gross profit. Additionally, the Generic Segment's operating expenses increased $4.2 million, primarily as a result of additional research and development (R&D) expenses. R&D expenses increased as a result of the continued investment in our generic development platform.
For the nine-month period, net revenues decreased $78.6 million to $753.6 million from $832.2 million in the same prior year period. As discussed above, overall unfavorable pricing, in particular on omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa, were also primarily responsible for the year over year decrease in sales. As was observed for the quarter, lower pricing was partially offset by increased volume. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2005, generic doses shipped were 8.7 billion, more than 5% greater than in fiscal 2004.
New products in the current fiscal year contributed net revenues of $38.0 million compared to $102.5 million in fiscal 2004.
Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 was $367.1 million, a decrease of $94.1 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2004. Gross margins decreased to 48.7% in the current year compared to 55.4% in the prior year.
 
Operating income decreased $105.9 million to $289.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was the result of lower gross profit as well as higher R&D and general and administrative (G&A) expenses.
Brand Segment
Brand Segment net revenues for the third quarter were $52.6 million, a decrease of $19.7 million from $72.3 million in the same prior year period. Included in net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was $13.2 million related to the sale of the U.S. and Canadian rights for sertaconazole 2% nitrate cream ("sertaconazole"). Unfavorable pricing, the result of increased generic competition on Amnesteem, was primarily responsible for the remainder of the decrease.
Brand Segment gross profit decreased $17.5 million to $28.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, while gross margins decreased to 53.4% from 63.0% in the same prior year period. The decrease in margin is primarily the result of the sale of sertaconazole in the prior year. Excluding the effects of this sale, the decrease in gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was not significant.
Earnings from operations were $3.4 million compared to $17.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year, a decrease of $13.7 million. This decrease was the result of the lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses. R&D expenses decreased $5.7 million primarily as a result of the completion, during fiscal 2004, of the Phase III clinical studies for nebivolol, for which an NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA on June 29, 2004. This decrease was partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses associated with the Company's launch of Apokyn and pre-marketing activities associated with nebivolol.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, Brand Segment net revenues decreased $25.7 million to $183.4 million from $209.1 million in the prior year. Excluding sertaconazole, the decrease in sales of $11.8 million was primarily driven by increased competition on certain branded products, such as Amnesteem, Digitek and Acticin, partially offset by higher revenues from phenytoin.
Gross profit for the Brand Segment decreased $19.9 million to $103.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Gross margins during this period decreased to 56.3% from 58.9% in the prior year. However, excluding sertaconazole, Brand Segment gross margins for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, increased slightly. This is primarily the result of favorable product mix, with higher margin products such as phenytoin comprising a higher percentage of sales, and Amnesteem, which contributes lower gross margins as a result of royalties paid under a supply and distribution agreement, comprising a smaller percentage.
Operating income for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 was $28.0 million, a decrease of $10.5 million from the same prior year period. This decrease was the result of lower gross profit, partially offset by lower overall operating expenses. As was observed for the quarter, R&D expenses were primarily responsible for the decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by higher selling and marketing.
 
Corporate/Other
G&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $34.4 million compared to $24.7 million in the same prior year period. The increase was the result of certain costs associated with the announced (but not completed) acquisition and integration of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("King") and the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, as well as increased payroll and payroll related costs. Other income for the third quarter was $3.7 million compared to $4.1 million in the same prior year period.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, G&A expenses increased $22.8 million to $94.2 million. This increase was the result of costs associated with the announced (but not completed) acquisition and integration of King and the implementation of ERP, increased legal and professional fees, and higher payroll and payroll related costs. Other income for the period was $6.3 million compared to $14.7 million in the same prior year period. Included in the prior year was a gain of $5.0 million on the sale of an office building in California.
