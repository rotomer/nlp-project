EXHIBIT INDEX

SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA The following tables present our summary historical and pro forma financial data. We derived annual historical information from our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 through 2005. The information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, as well as other information that has been filed with the SEC. The historical results included below may not be indicative of our future performance. Our unaudited pro forma statement of earnings and other pro forma financial information for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 gives effect to the financing for the tender offer as if it had occurred on April 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet data as of March 31, 2005 gives effect to the financing for the tender offer as if it had occurred on March 31, 2005. The unaudited pro forma data does not give effect to our expected repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of our common stock. The unaudited pro forma financial data does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would actually have been had the financing for the tender offer in fact occurred as of such dates and may not be indicative of our future performance.
- ------------ (1) In fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, we settled various outstanding legal matters for a net gain of $25,990, $34,758 and $2,370, respectively. (2) Pro forma interest expense has been computed using an average interest rate of 6.3%. (3) Following the completion of the Transactions, we expect to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock using existing cash reserves. The unaudited pro forma data does not give effect to this follow-on repurchase program. (4) Adjusted EBITDA has been reported as it is commonly used by investors to evaluate performance of companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents net earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income, net, costs related to the terminated acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and income taxes. Other income, net, includes interest income, income or loss from equity method investees, other non-operating income and expense items. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of operating income from operations as determined under GAAP. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Additionally, our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate it in the same fashion. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, as presented above, to net earnings:
