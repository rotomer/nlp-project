Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Credit Agreement
     On July 21, 2005, Mylan Laboratories Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), effective July 21, 2005, with a syndicate of bank lenders (the "Lenders"), including Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), as sole lead arranger, sole bookrunner and syndication agent, Keybank National Association, PNC Bank, National Association, SunTrust Bank and The Bank of New York, as co-documentation agents, and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, as administrative agent, for a $500 million senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility consists of a $225 million five-year revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which the Company intends to use for working capital and general corporate purposes, and a $275 million five-year term loan (the "Term Loan"), the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the purchase, through a self-tender offer which expired on July 15, 2005 (the "Tender Offer"), of 51,282,051 shares of the Company's common stock and to pay related fees and expenses.
     The Revolving Credit Facility contains provisions for the issuance of letters of credit. At the Company's option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at either a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, initially or at a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25%, initially and loans under the Term Loan bear interest at either a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.50%, initially or at a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50%, initially. The Company is required to pay a fee on the daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility which initially will be 0.50% per annum on the daily unused amount. The Term Loan will amortize quarterly commencing at the end of the first full fiscal quarter with 1% of the aggregate initial principal amount payable each year, up to and including the fourth year from the date of execution, with the balance payable in quarterly amounts during the fifth year from the date of execution.
     Subject to exceptions, the Credit Facility has mandatory prepayments with respect to certain proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances, equity issuances and with respect to the Company's excess cash flows.
     The Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the Company's direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, except a captive insurance company. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on, and pledge of, 100% of the equity interests of certain of the Company's wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and domestic subsidiaries owned by the guarantors and 65% of the equity interests of each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries and the foreign subsidiaries owned by the guarantors.
     The Credit Facility includes covenants that (a) require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio, (b) place limitations on the Company's ability and the Company's subsidiaries' ability to incur debt,
 
grant liens, carry out mergers, acquisitions and asset sales and make investments and (c) place limitations on the Company's ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants and bankruptcy.
     From time to time, some of the Lenders and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking and commercial banking services and general financing and other services to the Company for which they have in the past received, and may in the future receive, customary fees (some of such relationships are disclosed elsewhere in this report). In particular, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates have acted as the Company's financial advisor in connection with the terminated King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition, as an initial purchaser in the notes offering described below and as the dealer manager and financial advisor for the Tender Offer and in connection with the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. Additionally, affiliates of each of the Lenders are initial purchasers in the Company's notes offering.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and which is incorporated herein by reference.
Indenture and Registration Rights Agreement
     On July 21, 2005, the Company completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the "Notes"), consisting of $150 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior notes due 2010 (the "2010 Notes") and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015 (the ("2015 Notes") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A, and outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Notes Offering"). In connection with the Notes Offering, the Company entered into an indenture and a registration rights agreement, as described in the following paragraphs.
     The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of July 21, 2005, with The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Indenture"). The 2010 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.750% per year (payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2006), and mature on August 15, 2010. The 2015 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per year (payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2006), and mature on August 15, 2015. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes of each series prior to August 15, 2010 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a "make-whole premium.'' On or after August 15, 2010, the Company may redeem the 2015 Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture and form of note, which is attached as an exhibit to the Indenture. In addition, prior to August 15, 2008, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a price equal to (i) 105.750% of the principal amount of the 2010 Notes to be redeemed in the case of the 2010 Notes and (ii) 106.375% of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes to be redeemed in the case of the 2015 Notes (plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
 
redemption), provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of either the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes issued under the Indenture, as applicable, remains outstanding after the redemption. Upon a change of control of the Company, each holder of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes at 101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
     The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things and subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur secured indebtedness, make investments or other restricted payments, pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase the Company's capital stock, engage in sale-leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets. If the Notes are, in the future, rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc., certain of these covenants will, thereafter, no longer apply to the Notes, irrespective of whether the Notes continue to be rated investment grade.
     The Notes and the Indenture include, as events of default with respect to Notes of either series, (i) failure to pay principal on the Notes of such series, when due; (ii) failure to pay interest on the Notes of such series for 30 days after becoming due; (iii) failure in the performance of obligations under the covenant regarding consolidation, merger or sale of substantially all of the Company's property and assets; (iv) failure in the performance of any other covenant contained in the terms of the Indenture applicable to the Notes of such series for a period of 60 days after written notice from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of Notes of that series then outstanding; (v) failure to pay, or acceleration of and failure to pay, other indebtedness of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in excess of $40 million; (vi) the entry of nonappealable judgments in excess of $40 million against the Company or certain of its subsidiaries and such judgment or judgments have not been satisfied, stayed, annulled or rescinded within 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and nonappealable; (vii) any guarantee by a significant subsidiary of the Company ceasing to be in full force and enforceable and (viii) certain bankruptcy events.
     The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes, equally in right of payment with the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the Company's existing and future secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. Certain of the Company's existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility guarantee the Notes on a senior unsecured basis. Each guarantee is unsecured and ranks equally with the senior indebtedness of the guarantors, senior to all of the guarantors' senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of the guarantors to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.
     There are no material relationships between The Bank of New York and the Company or any of their respective affiliates, other than as follows: (a) The Bank of New York's service as trustee, registrar and paying agent under the Indenture and (b) an affiliate of The Bank of New York's role as a lender under the Credit Facility.
 
     In connection with the completion of the Notes Offering, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), dated as of July 21, 2005, with the guarantors party to the Registration Rights Agreement and the initial purchasers of the Notes named therein (the "Initial Purchasers"). The Registration Rights Agreement requires the Company to, at its cost, use its reasonable best efforts (i) to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a registration statement covering an offer to exchange the Notes for freely tradeable notes with substantially similar terms within 120 days of the issue date of the Notes (the "Closing Date"), (ii) to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 210 days of the Closing Date, (iii) to keep such registration statement effective until the exchange offer is consummated, (iv) to consummate the exchange offer within 240 days of the Closing Date and (v) if such registration statement is not declared effective, or if the exchange offer is not consummated, on the dates specified for such effectiveness or consummation, or if certain other events occur, to file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes. If (i) the Company fails to file any of the registration statements required by the Registration Rights Agreement on or before the date specified for such filing, (ii) any of such registration statements are not declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date specified for such effectiveness, (iii) the Company fails to consummate the Exchange Offer within 240 days after the Closing Date, or (iv) the shelf registration statement is declared effective but thereafter, subject to certain limited exceptions, ceases to be effective or usable in connection with the resales of registrable securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), as the case may be, during the periods specified in the Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company will pay additional interest to the holders of registrable securities, until such registration defaults are cured as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, in an amount equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of such registrable securities. Subject to certain cures, the amount of additional interest will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of such registrable securities, as applicable, for each subsequent 90-day period (or portion thereof) while a registration default is continuing, up to a maximum amount of 1.00% over the original interest rate of the Notes.
     Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have in the past and may continue in the future to provide the Company with investment banking and advisory services. In particular, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates have acted as the Company's financial advisor in connection with the terminated King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition, as the arranger and administrative agent under the Credit Facility and as the dealer manager and financial advisor for the Tender Offer and in connection with the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. Additionally, affiliates of each of the Initial Purchasers are Lenders under the Credit Facility.

          Subject to Sections 2.16 and 2.17, when Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request from the Holder of such Notes to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations of the same series, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested. Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorneys duly authorized in writing. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall issue and execute and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes evidencing such transfer or exchange at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made to the Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange. The Company may require from the Holder payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer taxes or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation to a transfer or exchange, but this provision shall not apply to any exchange pursuant to Section 2.11, 3.06 or 8.05 (in which events the Company shall be responsible for the payment of such taxes). The Registrar shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of any Note for a period of 15 days immediately preceding the redemption of Notes, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

SECTION 2.08. .
Replacement Notes
          If a mutilated Note is surrendered to the Registrar or the Trustee, or if the Holder of a Note claims that the Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Holder of such Note furnishes to the Company and the Trustee evidence reasonably acceptable to them of the ownership and the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date of this Indenture are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity bond shall be posted, sufficient in the judgment of all to protect the Company, the Trustee or any Paying Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if such Note is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for the Company's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in replacing such Note and the Trustee may charge the Company for the Trustee's expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) in replacing such Note. Every replacement Note shall constitute a contractual obligation of the Company.
SECTION 2.09. .

not outstanding. Subject to Section 2.10, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds the Note.
          If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser in whose hands such Note is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company.
          If the Paying Agent holds, in its capacity as such, on any Maturity Date, money sufficient to pay all accrued interest and principal with respect to the Notes payable on that date and is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders thereof pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
SECTION 2.10. .
Treasury Notes
          In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any declaration of acceleration or notice of default or direction, waiver or consent or any amendment, modification or other change to this Indenture, Notes owned by the Company or any other Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded as though they were not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent or any amendment, modification or other change to this Indenture, only Notes as to which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actually received an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes are so owned shall be so disregarded. Notes so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee established to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to the Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company any other obligor on the Notes or any of their respective Affiliates.
SECTION 2.11. .
Temporary Notes
          Until definitive Notes are prepared and ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes.

Until such exchange, temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges as definitive Notes.
SECTION 2.12. .
Cancellation
          The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Notes surrendered
 
for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall deliver such canceled Notes to the Company.

SECTION 2.13. .
Defaulted Interest
          If the Company defaults on a payment of interest on the Notes, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus (to the extent permitted by law) any interest payable on the defaulted interest, in accordance with the terms hereof, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be at least five Business Days prior to the payment date. The Company shall fix such special record date and payment date in a manner satisfactory to the Trustee. At least 10 days before such special record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest, and interest payable on defaulted interest, if any, to be paid. The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements (if applicable) of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed and, upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after written notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this sentence, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
SECTION 2.14. .
CUSIP Number
          The Company in issuing the Notes may use a "CUSIP," "ISIN" or other similar number, and if so, such CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number shall be included in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number printed in the notice or on the Notes, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any such CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number used by the Company in connection with the issuance of the Notes and of any change in the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number.

The principal and interest on Global Notes shall be payable to the Depository or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of the Global
 
Notes represented thereby. The principal and interest on Physical Notes shall be payable, either in person or by mail, at the office of the Paying Agent.

Agent or any agent of any of them as the absolute owner and holder of such Notes for all purposes whatsoever.

          Subject to Section 7.01, in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity. Subject to Section 7.07,
 
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case may be then outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes.

Any Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee, however, shall be subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
SECTION 7.04. .
Trustee's Disclaimer
          The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes and it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the sale of Notes or any money paid to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Notes or this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication, except that the Trustee
 
represents that it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture, authenticate the Notes and perform its obligations hereunder and that the statements made by it in any Statement of Eligibility and Qualification on Form T-1 to be supplied to the Company will be true and accurate subject to the qualifications set forth therein.

          If a Default with respect to the Notes of any series occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall give to each Holder of such series a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs in the manner and to the extent provided in the TIA and otherwise as provided in this Indenture. Except in the case of a Default in payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (including payments pursuant to a redemption or repurchase of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
SECTION 7.06. .
Reports by Trustee to Holders
          If required by TIA  313(a), within 60 days after June 15 of any year, commencing 2006, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such date that complies with TIA  313(a) (but if no event described in TIA  313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted).

          The Company shall pay to the Trustee and Agents from time to time such compensation for their services hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) as shall be agreed upon in writing. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee and Agents upon request for all reasonable disbursements, expenses and advances incurred or made by them in connection with the Trustee's duties under this Indenture, including the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and external counsel, except any expense disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its willful misconduct or negligence.
          The Company shall fully indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee for, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claim, liability or expense, including without limitation taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the Trustee or such Agent) and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by each of them in connection with the acceptance or performance of its duties under this Indenture including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder (including,
 
without limitation, settlement costs). The Trustee or Agent shall notify the Company in writing promptly of any claim of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge asserted against the Trustee or Agent for which it may seek indemnity; that the failure by the Trustee or Agent to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.

          To secure the payment obligations of the Company in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee and such money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.
          The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.07 to compensate and indemnify the Trustee, Agents and each predecessor Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee, Agents and each predecessor Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall be the liability of the Company and the lien provided for under this Section 7.07 and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction, discharge or other termination of this Indenture, including any termination or rejection hereof under any Bankruptcy Law.
          When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(8) or (9) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
          For purposes of this Section 7.07, the term "Trustee" shall include any trustee appointed pursuant to this Article Seven.
SECTION 7.08. .

     (2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief entered with respect to the Trustee under Bankruptcy Law;
     (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
     (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
          If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
          If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may petition at the expense of the Company any court of competent jurisdiction, in the case of the Trustee, for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately following such delivery, the retiring Trustee shall, subject to the lien and its rights under Section 7.07, transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Holder. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the lien and Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
SECTION 7.09. .
Successor Trustee by Consolidation, Merger, etc
          If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust assets to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee; such entity shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article Seven.

          (a) This Indenture as it applies to a series of Notes may be amended with the consent of the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes of such series), and any past default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture relating to a series of Notes may also be waived (except a default in the payment of principal, premium or interest and under Section 8.02(b) below) with the consent of the registered Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series.
          (b) However, without the consent of each Holder of a Note of a series, no amendment may,

          (c) It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
          (d) After an amendment that requires the consent of the Holders of the affected Notes becomes effective, the Company shall mail to each registered Holder of the affected Notes at such Holder's address appearing in the security register a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders of such Notes, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

SECTION 8.04. .
Revocation and Effect of Consents
          (a) After an amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent conclusive and binding upon such Holder and every subsequent Holder of the same Note or portion thereof, and of any Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in place thereof, even if notation of the consent is not made on any such Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
          (b) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement, or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then, notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement, or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.

In such case, the Trustee shall place an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 8.06. .
Trustee To Sign Amendments, etc

          (1) all the 2010 Notes or 2015 Notes, as the case may be, that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from this trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
          (2) (a) all 2010 Notes or 2015 Notes, as the case may be, not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation otherwise (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable, or may be called for redemption, within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption, and, in any case, the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of such Notes, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness (including all principal and accrued interest) on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, (b) the Company has paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture, and (c) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the 2010 Notes or 2015 Notes, as the case may be, at maturity or on the date of redemption, as the case may be.

Legal Defeasance
          (1) rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of and interest on the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case may be, when such payments are due from the trust funds referred to in Section 9.02,

          (3) the rights, powers, trust, duties, and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company's obligation in connection therewith,
          (4) this Article Nine, and
          (5) obligations under the TIA.
          In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors released with respect to Sections 4.06 through 4.12 under this Indenture with respect to either the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes (""), and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to such Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain Events of Default (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) will no longer apply. The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.
Covenant Defeasance
        (c) If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case may be, may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto.

        (e) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.04, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.07, 9.05 and 9.06 shall survive until such time as the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case may be, have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 9.05 and 9.06 shall survive.
SECTION 9.02. .
Conditions to Defeasance
          To exercise the Legal Defeasance option or the Covenant Defeasance option in Section 9.01 with respect to the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case may be:
          (a) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the 2010 Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case may be, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the Company, to pay the principal of and interest on the 2010 Notes or 2015 Notes, as the case may be, on the stated date for payment or on the redemption date of the principal or installment of principal of or interest on such Notes;
          (b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States confirming that:
               (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling; or
               (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
          (c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
 
          (d) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default resulting from the borrowing of funds and the grant of any related liens to be applied to such deposit);
          (e) the Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a Default under this Indenture or a default under any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound (other than any such Default or default resulting solely from the borrowing of funds and the grant of any related liens to be applied to such deposit);
          (f) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by it with the intent of preferring the Holders over any other of its creditors or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other of its creditors or others; and

          If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the 2010 Notes or 2015 Notes, as the case may be, when due, then the Company's obligations and the obligations of Guarantors under this Indenture will be revived and no such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.
          All money and Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.02(a) in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent, to the Holders of such Notes, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
          The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or the principal, premium, if any, and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.
 
          Anything in this Article Nine to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon a request of the Company any money or Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 9.02(a) which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
SECTION 9.04. .
Reinstatement
          If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 9.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article Nine until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 9.01; that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or accrued interest on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

          Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor.
          (b) Each Guarantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first

          (d) Each Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes are, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Notes, whether as a "voidable preference", "fraudulent transfer" or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Notes shall, to
 
the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
          (e) To evidence its Guarantee, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a Notation of Guarantee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit G hereto will be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered to the Trustee and that this Indenture or a supplemental indenture to this Indenture will be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its Officers.

Any amounts payable under this paragraph shall also be deemed "Additional Interest" for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the earlier of (i) the Shelf Registration Statement once again becoming usable or (ii) the expiration of the time period referred to in Rule 144(k) under the 1933 Act, the interest rate borne by the Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate if no Registration Defaults exist at such time. Additional Interest shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed in each 90-day period in which the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable.
          The Company shall notify the Trustee within three business days after each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Additional Interest is required to be paid (an "").

          (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Holders and, if applicable, the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
          The relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Holders and, if applicable, the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by an Issuer, the Holders or the Initial Purchasers, as applicable, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
          The Issuers, the Holders and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser or Holder, and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls an Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Issuer.

Any payment made by the Borrower after 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been on the next following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
          (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period commencing on the Borrowing Date until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower. Nothing herein shall limit the rights of the Borrower against any such defaulting Lender.
          (g) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable credit extension set forth in Section 5 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
          (h) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and of the Revolving Lenders to fund participations in Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation.
          (i) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

     (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or
     (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition relating to funding of assets that would include Loans or the income or earnings in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes indemnified by Section 2.19, taxes excluded from indemnification under Section 2.19 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender reasonably deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
          (b) If any Lender shall have determined in good faith that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
          (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.

If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("") or any Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, then (i) the amounts so payable to such Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law; , , that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this Section or (ii) that are United States federal withholding or backup withholding taxes in effect at the time such Lender or the Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement or, with respect to an assignment, a designation of a new Lending Office, a transfer or an appointment of a successor Administrative Agent, the effective date thereof, except to the extent that such Person's predecessor or previous Lending Office (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, appointment or designation of a new Lending Office, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph (a); that this subclause (ii) shall not apply to any tax imposed on such Lender in connection with an interest or participation in any Loan or other obligation that such Lender was required to acquire pursuant to .

No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.

In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.7 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share (determined at the time such reimbursement is sought) of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.
