Exhibit 99.1
PITTSBURGH, PA  May 9, 2006  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. For the fourth quarter, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.27, compared to $0.14 in the same prior year period. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the Company reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.00 and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.79. Mylan today also reaffirmed its fiscal 2007 guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 per diluted share. This range of guidance excludes approximately $0.06 per diluted share of stock-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R) which was adopted by the Company on April 1, 2006. Had the Company been required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) on April 1, 2005, the impact on the financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, would have been approximately $0.04 per diluted share.
Robert J. Coury, Mylan's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "We are very pleased to have delivered strong results at the upper end of the guidance we provided despite the fact that the generic industry continues to be highly competitive and unpredictable. This strong performance was driven by the successful execution of each of our strategic initiatives. We are well positioned as we enter fiscal 2007 based on the continued strengthening of our core generic business and the expected addition of significant new products from our robust pipeline. We are also pleased to reaffirm our fiscal 2007 guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 per share, which represents EPS growth of at least 20%.
During fiscal 2006, Mylan began providing adjusted earnings per diluted share, which is a non-GAAP measure, in order to enhance investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the Company's financial performance. Adjusted earnings per diluted share does not include the following items: (1) certain research and development and marketing costs related to nebivolol that had been incurred until the out-licensing agreement relating to such product was signed, (2) costs, including restructuring costs, related to Mylan Bertek, the subsidiary that Mylan announced in the first quarter that it was closing, and (3) a contingent legal liability related to previously-disclosed litigation in connection with the Company's lorazepam and clorazepate products. The Company continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims in the litigation and intends to continue to vigorously defend its position, including pursuing a motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial, and if those motions are denied, pursuing an appeal. A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per
 
diluted share to GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, appears below.
Net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, were $315.0 million, the same as for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Net revenues for fiscal 2006 were $1.24 billion compared to fiscal 2005 net revenues of $1.25 billion. New products launched during the year contributed $6.7 million to net revenues in the current year, compared to $87.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to fentanyl. The Company considers a product to be a new product for four quarters beginning with the quarter it is launched. As such, beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, fentanyl is included in the Company's base business. Mylan currently has one of the most robust pipelines in the Company's history, with approximately 60 Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") pending before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), representing approximately $47.0 billion in calendar year 2005 brand sales.
Net earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2006, increased $19.5 million to $57.7 million from $38.1 million in the same prior year period. Net earnings for fiscal 2006 were $184.5 million compared to $203.6 million for fiscal 2005. Earnings per diluted share were $0.74 in the prior year, which includes net gains of approximately $0.06 from the settlement of other litigation.
Financial Summary
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were $315.0 million, the same as for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. During the quarter, price erosion on certain products within the Company's portfolio was essentially offset by favorable volume.
Additionally, the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 included other revenues of $9.6 million compared to $1.4 million in the same prior year period. The increase is primarily due to revenue recognized on the sale of Mylan's Apokyn product in the third quarter.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased by 5% or $7.6 million to $160.8 million from $153.2 million in the same prior year period, while margins increased to 50% from 48%. Operating income was $91.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006, an increase of $38.6 million from the same prior year period. The increase in gross profit and lower overall operating expenses were primarily responsible for the increase in operating income.
Research and development ("R&D") expenses decreased by $1.6 million to $19.5 million from $21.2 million in the same prior year period, while selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased by $29.4 million to $49.4 million from $78.8 million. SG&A expenses in the prior year fourth quarter included $18.3 million of costs associated with a terminated acquisition. Additionally, the decrease in SG&A expenses is a direct result of cost savings realized from the closure of Mylan Bertek in the current year.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, net revenues decreased by $7.8 million or 1% to $1.24 billion from $1.25 billion in the prior fiscal year. New products launched during the year contributed $6.7 million to net revenues in the current year, compared to $87.3
 
million in the prior year. However, fiscal 2006 net revenues did benefit from a full year of sales of fentanyl, as well as other products launched during fiscal 2005. Additionally, as in the fourth quarter, favorable volume essentially offset price erosion on certain products within the Company's portfolio.
Fiscal 2006 included other revenues of $17.2 million, compared to $5.6 million in the prior year. The majority of the increase in the current year is the result of the sale of Mylan's Apokyn product in the third quarter.
Gross profit for fiscal 2006 increased by $4.1 million to $627.6 million from $623.5 million in fiscal 2005 and gross margins remained stable at 50%. Operating income was $287.4 million for fiscal 2006, a decrease of $14.8 million from prior year operating income of $302.2 million. This decrease is the result of the negative impact of litigation in the current year compared to the prior year, and higher R&D expenses, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. In the prior year, $26.0 million of net gains on legal settlements were recorded. The current year includes a charge of $12.4 million, the majority of which was to accrue for a contingent legal liability with respect to the lorazepam and clorazepate litigation.
R&D expenses increased by $14.2 million to $102.1 million primarily as a result of an increase in ongoing studies, in particular those with respect to nebivolol, prior to the outlicensing of the product early in the fourth quarter. SG&A expenses decreased by $33.7 million to $225.8 million as a result of cost savings realized from the closure of Mylan Bertek, net of the related restructuring charges, and as a result of $22.9 million of charges incurred in the prior year with respect to a terminated acquisition.
Fiscal 2006 included restructuring charges of approximately $20.9 million of which $19.9 million is recorded in SG&A. The restructuring charges consist primarily of severance and related costs primarily associated with the Mylan Bertek sales force as well as lease termination costs and sample inventory write-offs.
Other income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was $4.1 million and $18.5 million, which consists primarily of interest income. Interest expense totaled $11.7 million and $31.3 million for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2006.
During fiscal 2006, Mylan issued $775.0 million of long-term debt which was used to partially finance a modified "Dutch Auction" self-tender and $250.0 million follow-on repurchase. In total during fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 63.9 million shares of its common stock for a total of $1.26 billion. During the year, Mylan made $87.1 million in payments on its long-term debt, including an optional pre-payment of $85.0 million in March 2006. Capital expenditures for the year ended March 31, 2006, were $103.7 million, and comparable expenditures are expected for fiscal 2007.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Prior to fiscal 2006, Mylan had not disclosed non-GAAP financial measures when providing financial results. However, due primarily to the restructuring that occurred during fiscal 2006 and the outlicensing of the Company's nebivolol product completed in the fourth quarter (both of which were announced as plans by Mylan on June 14, 2005), Mylan now believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with
 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, Mylan is disclosing non-GAAP results that exclude items such as those discussed above in order to enhance investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the Company's financial performance because the Company's ongoing, normal business operations do not include such items. Also, management uses these measures internally for forecasting and budgeting. Whenever Mylan uses such a non-GAAP measure, it will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most closely applicable GAAP measure set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
