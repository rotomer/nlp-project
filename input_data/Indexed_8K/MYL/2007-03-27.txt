Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On March 26, 2007, Mylan Laboratories Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company") was notified that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has enjoined the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from approving any additional Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for Amlodipine Besylate Tablets, 2.5 mg (base), 5 mg (base) and 10 mg (base) from April 11, 2007 until at least April 13, 2007. A copy of the Court's order is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, and a copy of the Company's press release dated March 27, 2007, relating to the order is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (c) 
Exhibits.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
     Pending before the court is the plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order ("TRO") to enjoin the defendant Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") from issuing approvals for any abbreviated new drug applications ("ANDAs") for amlodipine besylate. The plaintiffs seek this TRO claiming that they are entitled by statute to a 180-day period of exclusive marketing and sale of the drug's generic version. They argue that their statutory right to exclusivity will be infringed if the FDA grants ANDAs to other generic drug manufacturers.
     Government counsel has represented to the court that the FDA will now solicit the views of other interested parties on this matter by April 4, 2007 and will render an agency decision on April 11, 2007. Pursuant to this representation, the court need not enjoin agency action during the pendency of this matter at the agency. Government counsel has left open the possibility, however, that the FDA's April 11, 2007 decision may simply constitute agency approval of the ANDAs. Such an eventuality would frustrate the process now in place for the court to evaluate the pending TRO application.
 
     To ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to advance their positions to the court on this matter prior to the FDA taking final action on the pending drug approvals, it is this 26th day of March, 2007 hereby
     that the FDA notify the court of its decision no later than April 11, 2007, and it is
ORDERED
     that the FDA is enjoined from taking final agency action (i.e., granting any ANDAs at issue in this matter) from April 11, 2007 until April 13, 2007 at 5:00 pm to enable the court to rule formally on the plaintiffs' application for a TRO.
FURTHER ORDERED
     If the FDA decides to grant the ANDAs, the defendants' opposition to the plaintiffs' application for a TRO will be due by 9:00 am on April 12, 2007, and the plaintiffs' reply will be due by 9:00 am on April 13, 2007.
     .
SO ORDERED
