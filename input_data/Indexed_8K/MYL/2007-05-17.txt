Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Share Purchase Agreement
     On May 12, 2007, Mylan Laboratories Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Mylan" or the "Company"), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") with Merck Generics Holding GmbH, a German limited liability company, Merck S.A., a French stock corporation, and Merck Internationale Beteiligung GmbH, a German limited liability company (such entities, "Sellers"), and Merck KGaA, a German limited partnership ("Merck"), as Sellers' representative and guarantor, to acquire Merck's generic pharmaceutical business (the "Business"). Pursuant to the SPA, Mylan has agreed to pay an aggregate cash purchase price of EUR 4.9 billion (or approximately $6.7 billion) for the Business. Subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, the Company will acquire 100% of the shares of five entities, which acquisition is expected to be consummated during the second half of calendar year 2007.
     The foregoing description of the SPA and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to that agreement. A copy of the SPA is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. A copy of the press release regarding the transaction is also attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Commitment Letter
     Also on May 12, 2007, Mylan signed a letter (the "Commitment Letter") with Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. (the "Financing Sources"), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed to loan the Company and one or more of its non-U.S. subsidiaries up to $7.7 billion in connection with the acquisition of the Business (the "Debt Financing"). The Debt Financing consists of up to $2.85 billion as an unsecured senior interim loan, which will only be utilized to the extent Mylan does not complete longer term financings prior to closing (the "Closing") the acquisition of the Business, and $4.85 billion of available borrowings under new senior secured credit facilities, which include a $750 million revolving credit facility and $4.1 billion of term loan facilities. The Debt Financing will be guaranteed by various subsidiaries of Mylan and used, among other things, to pay the purchase price for the Business, refinance existing indebtedness and pay related fees and expenses. The Debt Financing is subject to the negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive documentation, which will include customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Additionally, the lenders' obligation to provide the Debt Financing is subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, including the refinancing by Mylan of certain of its existing indebtedness, which is currently expected to include its $150 million of 5.750% Senior Notes due 2010 and $350 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015, consummation of the acquisition of the Business in accordance with the terms of the SPA, the accuracy of specified representations, the absence of specified defaults, the delivery of a certificate on behalf of the Company with respect to the solvency (on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the SPA, and other customary conditions.
 
     The above description of the terms of the Debt Financing is based solely on the Commitment Letter, and therefore may be subject to material change prior to or in connection with any entry by the Company into definitive documentation in respect thereof.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Mylan Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: MYL) and Merck KGaA today announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which Mylan will acquire Merck's generics business ("Merck Generics") for EUR 4.9 billion ($6.7 billion) in an all-cash transaction. The combination of Mylan and Merck Generics will create a vertically and horizontally integrated generics and specialty pharmaceuticals leader with a diversified revenue base and a global footprint. On a pro forma basis, for calendar 2006, the combined company would have had revenues of approximately $4.2 billion, EBITDA of approximately $1.0 billion and approximately 10,000 employees, immediately making it among the top tier of global generic companies, with a significant presence in all of the top five global generics markets.
Pittsburgh, PA; May 12, 2007 
In addition to retaining Hank Klakurka, currently President and CEO of Merck Generics, Mylan has executed long-term employment agreements with members of Merck Generics' senior management team, ensuring that senior leadership remains intact. Mylan views the existing management and employees of Merck Generics as key to the success of the combined company.
Robert J. Coury, Mylan's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "Mylan's acquisition of Merck Generics would substantially complete the execution on one of its long-term visions: to create a world class global quality generics leader. The fit between our two companies is truly outstanding. Mylan is already a leader in the U.S., the world's largest market, and through Matrix Laboratories controls one of the broadest API platforms in the world. Merck Generics provides us with leading positions in many of the world's other key regions. Together, we will form a powerful, diverse, robust and vertically integrated generics platform.
 
 
The combination with Merck Generics will significantly extend our range of therapeutic categories and dosage forms, and bring us a number of new, differentiated products and successful franchises."
Merck Generics is a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, a more than 300-year old global chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. Merck Generics has sales in more than 90 countries and is the world's number three ranked generics business by 2006 calendar year revenues. It has more than 400 high quality products and 70% of its revenues are generated from countries where it is a top three player. Merck Generics' U.S. specialty pharmaceuticals business, Dey, is focused on respiratory and allergy products and had $650 million in revenues in 2006. Merck Generics reported sales of EUR 1.8 billion ($2.45 billion) and EBITDA of EUR 335 million ($450 million) in 2006. The business employs approximately 5,000 people worldwide.
Hank Klakurka, President and CEO of Merck Generics, said: "My management team and I are extremely excited to be joining the Mylan team. We believe Mylan is the best possible acquirer for our company. The two businesses are an excellent fit in terms of geography and product mix, and together we can offer extremely attractive product baskets across our combined territories. Mylan has established itself as a leader in the U.S. in terms of quality, manufacturing excellence and customer service, and has demonstrated a strong commitment to its employees and the communities in which it operates. My team and I look forward to working with Mylan to build an undisputed world leader in quality generics."
Strategic Rationale
The acquisition offers a unique, compelling opportunity to create a global generics leader with critical mass in most of the important generics markets. The transaction positions Mylan to leverage substantial growth opportunities and maximize operating efficiencies driven by global scale.
 
Transaction Details
Under terms of the transaction, which have been unanimously approved by Mylan's Board of Directors, Mylan will acquire 100% of the shares of the various businesses comprising Merck Generics for a cash consideration of EUR 4.9 billion ($6.7 billion). Mylan has secured fully committed debt financing from Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.
The transaction is anticipated to be dilutive to full-year cash EPS in year one, breakeven in year two, and significantly accretive thereafter based on management's internal projections. The company is committed to reducing its leverage in the near term through the issuance of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of equity and equity-linked securities. The combined company will generate substantial free cash flow that will further enable it to rapidly reduce acquisition-related debt. Reflecting its more leveraged capital structure and focus on growth, Mylan is suspending the dividend on its common stock.

Mylan expects to achieve synergies of approximately $250 million by the end of year three. The majority of these synergies will result from vertical integration of Merck's API supply by leveraging the Matrix platform, aligning capabilities in research and development, and driving further efficiencies in increased manufacturing volumes of key products across the globe.
 
Mylan does not anticipate significant reductions in headcount at Mylan, Matrix or Merck Generics in order to achieve these synergies.
The combined company will have a dramatically accelerated growth profile with long-term compounded net income growth expected to exceed 30% per annum and long-term revenue growth in excess of 10%. This growth will be driven by new opportunities created by the formation of a truly global platform, through promising growth at Merck Generics, and by expected de-leveraging of the balance sheet.
The transaction remains subject to regulatory review in relevant jurisdictions and certain other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the second half of 2007.
Mr. Coury concluded: "We have been very impressed by the successful business built by the management team and employees at Merck Generics and by their dedication to excellence across all areas of their operations. We look forward to working together to create greater opportunities for all employees of Mylan and Merck Generics, as well as to uniting two cultures built on excellence in regulatory, R&D, manufacturing and customer service in one of the world's largest global generic pharmaceutical companies."
Merrill Lynch acted as exclusive financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to Mylan in this transaction. The external legal counsel for Mylan was Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP.
