Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Mylan Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company") confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs") and each of the other Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to the (i) sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the numbers of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") set forth in Schedules A and B hereto and (ii) grant by the Company to the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any part of 8,025,000 additional shares of Common Stock to cover overallotments, if any. The aforesaid 53,500,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Initial Securities") to be purchased by the Underwriters and all or any part of the 8,025,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the option described in Section 2(b) hereof (the "Option Securities") are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities."
     Concurrently with the offering and sale of the Securities by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company is offering to sell up to 1,860,000 shares of 6.50% convertible preferred stock (including any shares of such preferred stock subject to the underwriters' over-allotment option) (the "Convertible Preferred Stock"), pursuant to the terms of an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of even date herewith, among the Company, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and the other underwriters named therein (the "Concurrent Convertible Preferred Stock Offering").
     The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representatives deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-140778), including the related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "1933 Act Regulations") under the Securities Act of
 
1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities under the 1933 Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B ("Rule 430B") of the 1933 Act Regulations and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto at such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by 1933 Act Regulations, is herein called the "Registration Statement."

For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
     All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

Possession of Intellectual Property

Termination of Agreement
     SECTION 6. .
Indemnification
     (a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the 1933 Act (each, an "Affiliate"), its selling agents and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters by the Company
     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any
 
claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; that (subject to Section 6(e) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company;
provided
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through any Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
     (b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) and (b) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through any Representative expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
     (c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
     SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number of Initial Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
     SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
     SECTION 9. .
Termination of Agreement
     (a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) or the General Disclosure Package, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq Global Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or with respect to Clearstream or Eurocolar Systems in Europe, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal, New York or Pennsylvania authorities.
Termination; General
     (b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
     SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at Closing Time or an Additional Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Under-
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
 
writers, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
     (a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number of Securities to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or, in the case of an Additional Closing Time that is after the Closing Time, which does not result in a termination of the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and the Company to sell the relevant Option Securities, as the case may be, or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time or the relevant Additional Closing Time, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.
     SECTION 11. .
Default by the Company
     If the Company shall fail at Closing Time or at the Date of Delivery to sell the number of Securities that it is obligated to sell hereunder, then this Agreement shall terminate without any liability on the part of any nondefaulting party; provided, however, that the provisions of Sections 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8 shall remain in full force and effect. No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve the Company from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
     SECTION 12. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, immediately upon commencement of discussions with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company (and each employee, representative or other agent of the Company) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Company relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "tax treatment" is the purported or claimed federal income tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the term "tax structure" includes any fact that may be relevant to understanding the purported or claimed federal income tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     Mylan Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company") confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs") and each of the other Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to the (i) sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the numbers of shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Company ("Preferred Stock") set forth in Schedules A and B hereto and (ii) grant by the Company to the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any part of 279,000 additional shares of Preferred Stock to cover overallotments, if any. The aforesaid 1,860,000 shares of Preferred Stock (the "Initial Securities") to be purchased by the Underwriters and all or any part of the 279,000 shares of Preferred Stock subject to the option described in Section 2(b) hereof (the "Option Securities") are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities."
     Concurrently with the offering and sale of the Securities by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company is offering to sell up to 53,500,000 shares of common stock (including any shares of such common stock subject to the underwriters' over-allotment option) (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to the terms of an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of even date herewith, among the Company, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and the other underwriters named therein (the "Concurrent Commmon Stock Offering").
     The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representatives deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-140778), including the related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "1933 Act Regulations") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities
 
under the 1933 Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B ("Rule 430B") of the 1933 Act Regulations and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto at such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by 1933 Act Regulations, is herein called the "Registration Statement."

For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
     All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

provided
however
 
     (2) In addition to and without limitation of the Company's obligation to indemnify Cowen and Company, LLC as an Underwriter, the Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Independent Underwriter, its Affiliates and selling agents and each person, if any, who controls the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, incurred as a result of the Independent Underwriter's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Conduct Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. in connection with the offering of the Securities.

Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
     (c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a)(1) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances; provided, that, if indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 6(a)(2), then, in addition to the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from its own counsel and that of the other indemnified parties for the Independent Underwriter in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of 1934 Act in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances if, in the reasonable judgment of the Independent Underwriter, there may exist a conflict of interest between the Independent Underwriter and the other indemnified parties. Any such separate counsel for the Independent Underwriter and such control persons of the Independent Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Independent Underwriter. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
     SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that Cowen and Company, LLC will not receive any additional benefits hereunder for serving as the Independent Underwriter in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number of Initial Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
     SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
     SECTION 9. .
Termination of Agreement
     (a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) or the General Disclosure Package, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq Global Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or with respect to Clearstream or Eurocolar Systems in Europe, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal, New York or Pennsylvania authorities.
Termination; General
 
     (b) .

     (b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or, in the case of an Additional Closing Time that is after the Closing Time, which does not result in a termination of the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and the Company to sell the relevant Option Securities, as the case may be, or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time or the relevant Additional Closing Time, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve the Company from liability, if any, in respect of such default.

Conversion Date
          (b) The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon any such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date. No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 14, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such applicable Conversion Date. Prior to such applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.

Section 12. Reservation of Common Stock.
          (a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury of the Company, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 12(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock reacquired and held in the treasury of the Company (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such treasury shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).

Section 13. Fractional Shares.
          (a) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or as a result of any payment of dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock.
          (b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8 hereof or a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 9 or a cash acquisition conversion pursuant to Section 10 hereof or as a result of the election of the Company to pay any dividend in shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4A hereof, the Company shall at its option either (i) issue to such Holder a whole share of Common Stock or (ii) pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of the average Daily Closing Price of the Common Stock for the applicable Dividend Reference Period.
          (c) If more than one share of the Convertible Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered. If the Company pays dividends in Common Stock on more than one share of the Convertible Preferred Stock held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock so held.
          (a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
Section 14. Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
     If the Company issues Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock to all holders of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(i) Stock Dividends and Distributions and Subdivisions, Splits and Combinations of the Common Stock.
 
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this subclause (i) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after (x) the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this subclause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     If the Company issues to all holders of the Common Stock any rights, warrants, options or other securities entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of issuance thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, or if the Company issues to all holders of Common Stock securities convertible into Common Stock for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of issuance thereof, in either case at an exercise price per share of Common Stock or a conversion price per share of Common Stock less than the Daily Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(ii) Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights.
     For purposes of this subclause (ii), in determining whether any rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase, or exercise a conversion right for, Common Stock at less than the Daily Closing Price of the Common Stock on the applicable date, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. If any right, warrant, option, other security or convertible security described in this subclause (ii) is not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such right, warrant, option, other security or convertible security had not been so issued.
 
     Any adjustment made pursuant to this subclause (ii) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.
     
(iii) Debt or Asset Distribution.
     (A) If the Company distributes capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company to all holders of the Common Stock, excluding:
     (x) dividends, distributions, rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities referred to in subclause (i) or (ii) above,
     (y) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and
     (z) Spin-Offs described in subclause (iii)(B) below,
then each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this subclause (iii)(A) shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective on the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution for such distribution.
     If any such dividend or distribution described in this subclause (iii)(A) is declared but not paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (B) If the Company distributes to all holders of the Common Stock capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the date fixed for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
     An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this subclause (iii)(B) will occur on the 10th Trading Day from and including the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following and including the date of the Spin-Off, references with respect to the Spin-Off to "10 Trading Days" shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the conversion date in determining the applicable Fixed Conversion Rate.
provided
     If any such dividend or distribution described in this subclause (iii)(B) is declared but not paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     If the Company pays or makes any dividend or distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(iv) Cash Distributions.
     An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this subclause (iv) shall become effective on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution described in this subclause (iv) is declared but not so paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     If the Company or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Daily Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(v) Self Tender Offers and Exchange Offers.
Expiration Time
 
     If the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in a Fixed Conversion Rate, no adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate will be made. Any adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this subclause (v) shall become effective on the date immediately following the determination of the average of the Daily Closing Prices of the Common Stock for purposes of SP1 above. If the Company or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchase or all such purchases are rescinded, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
     If the Company has in effect a rights plan while any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will receive, upon a conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock, in addition to Common Stock, rights under the Company's shareholder rights agreement unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock. If the rights provided for in the rights plan have separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement so that holders of Convertible Preferred Stock would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Company is required to deliver upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company had distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property pursuant to subclause (iii)(A) above, subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.
(vi) Rights Plans.
          (b) The Company may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 14, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of the Company's shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
Adjustment for Tax Reasons.
provided
          (c) 
Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price and Cash Acquisition Stock Price.
     (i) No adjustment in any Fixed Conversion Rate will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Fixed Conversion Rate. If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the Fixed Conversion Rate by at least 1%, then the adjustment that is not made will be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment. All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/10,000th of a share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all adjustments not previously made shall have effect with respect to any conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 8, 9 or 10 hereof. If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Section 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), l4(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(b), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 8(b) shall apply on the Conversion Date. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment
 
pursuant to Section 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), l4(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(b) and the denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment; that if such adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by Section 14(a)(i), l4(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(b) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
provided
     (ii) If an adjustment is made to the Minimum Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(b), a proportional adjustment shall be made to each Cash Acquisition Stock Price column heading set forth in the table included in the definition of "Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate." Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying each Cash Acquisition Stock Price included in such table by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment.
     (iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to such adjustment, so long as the distributed assets or securities the Holders would receive upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stockif such assets or securities are convertible, exchangeable, or exercisableare convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 45 days following conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. The applicable Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
     (A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in the Common Stock under any plan;
     (B) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan, employee agreement or arrangement or program of the Company;
     (C) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Issue Date;
     (D) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;
     (E) for cumulated and unpaid dividends or distributions; or
     (F) as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares of the Common Stock.
     (iv) The Company shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity and its action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall be final and conclusive unless clearly inconsistent with the intent hereof.
          (d) Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, is to be adjusted, the Company shall: (i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock of the occurrence of such event and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide, or cause to be provided, to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock a statement setting
Notice of Adjustment.
 
forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, was determined and setting forth such revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable.
          (e) In the event of:
Reorganization Events.
     (A) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another Person),
     (B) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the Company's property and assets, or
     (C) any reclassification of the Common Stock into securities including securities other than the Common Stock (any such event specified in paragraphs (A) through (C), a ""),
