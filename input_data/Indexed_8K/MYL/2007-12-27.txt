Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
      As previously announced, on October 2, 2007, Mylan Inc. ("Mylan" or the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "Original Senior Credit Agreement") among the Company, Mylan Luxembourg 5 S. r.l. (the "Euro Borrower"), certain lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent). Mylan, the Euro Borrower, certain lenders and the Administrative Agent entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Amended Senior Credit Agreement") dated as of December 20, 2007, and is expected to become effective as of December 28, 2007 that, among other things, amends certain provisions of the Original Senior Credit Agreement as set out below.
      The Amended Senior Credit Agreement (i) reduces the principal amount of the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans of the Company to an aggregate principal amount of $312,500,000.00, (ii) increases the principal amount of the U.S. Tranche B Term Loans of the Company to an aggregate principal amount of $2,556,000,000.00, (iii) creates a new tranche of Euro Tranche A Term Loans of the Euro Borrower in an aggregate principal amount of 350,414,947.37 and (iv) reduces the Euro Tranche B Term Loans of the Euro Borrower to an aggregate principal amount of 525,000,000.00.
      The new Euro Tranche A Term Loans currently bear interest at EURIBO (determined in accordance with the Amended Senior Credit Agreement) plus 3.25% per annum. Under the terms of the Amended Senior Credit Agreement, the applicable margin over EURIBO for the Euro Tranche A Term Loans can fluctuate based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
      The Euro Tranche A Term Loans mature on October 2, 2013. The Euro Tranche A Term Loans require amortization payments of 4,380,186.84 per quarter in 2008, 8,760,373.68 per quarter in 2009, 13,140,560.53 per quarter in 2010, 17,520,747.37 per quarter in 2011, 21,900,934.21 per quarter in 2012 and 21,900,934.21 per quarter in 2013. In connection with the decrease in the aggregate principal amount of the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans, the amortization payments required with respect to the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans have been revised to $3,906,250.00 per quarter in 2008, $7,812,500.00 per quarter in 2009, $11,718,750.00 per quarter in 2010, $15,625,000.00 per quarter in 2011, $19,531,250.00 per quarter in 2012 and $19,531,250.00 per quarter in 2013.
      The Amended Senior Credit Agreement adds a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the principal amount of the U.S. Tranche B Term Loans or Euro Trance B Term Loans prepaid in connection with voluntary and certain mandatory prepayments during the 12 months following the date of effectiveness of the Amended Senior Credit Agreement.
      The foregoing description of the Amended Senior Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Senior Credit Agreement. A copy of the Amended Senior Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Expiration Date
          (d) . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Amount from time to time available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason.

unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
          (e) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date the relevant Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if such Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Company, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by such Issuing Bank pursuant to such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 3:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 3:00 p.m., Local Time, on (i) the Business Day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that unless the Company elects otherwise, the Company shall be deemed, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, to have requested in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or, if such amount is less than $1,000,000, Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount of such LC Disbursement and, to the extent so financed, the Company's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the relevant Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Company's reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Company shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC
Reimbursement

Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable exchange rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.
          (f) . The Company's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the relevant Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Company's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the relevant Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the relevant Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
Obligations Absolute

A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower, or the Company on its behalf, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.

     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period and Agreed Currency to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
          (e) If the relevant Borrower or the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.11. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing borrowed by the Company may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing borrowed by the Company shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may only be continued for an Interest Period of one month.

If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the Term Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such Lender's pro rata share of such mandatory prepayment of Term Loans. Any Declined Proceeds shall be offered to the Term Lenders not so declining such prepayment on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Dollar Amounts of the Term Loans of such Lenders (with such non-declining Term Lenders having the right to decline any prepayment with Declined Proceeds at the time and in the manner specified by the Administrative Agent). To the extent such non-declining Term Lenders elect to decline their pro rata share of such Declined Proceeds, any Declined Proceeds remaining thereafter (the "") shall be retained by the Company and used for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Agreement. The Administrative Agent may make appropriate adjustments to the accounts of the Term Lenders to reflect any non pro rata payment of Term Loans of any Class as a result of this Section 2.11(b)(iv).

Alternate Rate of Interest
     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate, Adjusted EURIBO Rate or EURIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate, Adjusted EURIBO Rate or EURIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy or transmission by electronic communication in accordance with Section 9.01(b) as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing, (iii) all Euro Tranche A Term Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith to reflect the Euro Tranche A Term Lenders cost of maintaining the Euro Tranche A Term Loans plus the Applicable Rate and (iv) all Euro Tranche B Term Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith to reflect the Euro Tranche B Term Lenders cost of maintaining the Euro Tranche B Term Loans plus the Applicable Rate.

Increased Costs
          (a) If any Change in Law shall:
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein (excluding imposition of Taxes resulting from a Change in Law, which shall be governed by Section 2.17);
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency), in each case by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material in the context of its making of, and participation in, extensions of credit under this Agreement, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
 
of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

The Company shall pay, or cause the other Borrowers to pay, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender may be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate (as applicable) that would have been applicable to such Loan (and excluding any Applicable Rate), for the period

Taxes
          (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Loan Party hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
          (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment by any Loan Party on behalf of such Borrower) hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section), and any other Other Taxes, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is legally entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any Loan made to a Borrower that is organized in the United States of America or the Euro Borrower, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
     (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party,
     (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms),

Exhibit J
     (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
          To the extent it is legally entitled to do so: any Foreign Lender that does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (in such number of original copies as shall be requested by the recipient), on or prior to the date such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender, or on such later date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable (and from time to time thereafter, if
 
reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms), together with information, if any, such Foreign Lender is required to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code or the regulations thereunder, to establish that such Foreign Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Foreign Lender and to establish that such remaining portion may be received without deduction for, or at a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax.
          Each Foreign Lender shall, from time to time after the initial delivery by such Foreign Lender of the forms described above, whenever a lapse in time or change in such Foreign Lender's circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence so delivered obsolete or inaccurate, promptly (1) deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) renewals, amendments or additional or successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or establish such Foreign Lender's status or that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax or (2) notify Administrative Agent and the Company of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence.
          (f) If the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender determines, in its sole good faith discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall promptly pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. The Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender shall, at the Company's request, provide the Company with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority ( that the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender may delete any information therein that the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender deems confidential). This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs
          (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of
 
payments by the Company denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments by the Euro Borrower or payments denominated in a Foreign Currency, 2:00 p.m., Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to Dollars, in Dollars) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the "") no longer exists or any Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
Original Currency
          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be
 
shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency).
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and
 
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Any Lender claiming reimbursement of such costs and expenses shall deliver to the Company a certificate setting forth such costs and expenses in reasonable detail which shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or any Lender is unable to fund its portion of any Loan as a result of any applicable law or regulation prohibiting, or any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority enjoining, prohibiting or restraining, any Lender from making any Loan requested by such Borrower or any Issuing Bank or any Lender from issuing, renewing, extending or increasing the face amount of or participating in the Letter of Credit requested to be issued, renewed, extended or increased by such Borrower, or if any Lender (a "") fails to grant a consent in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 9.02 for which the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender is required but the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, to the extent required by Section 9.04, and (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including, in the case of any U.S. Tranche B Term Loans or Euro Tranche B Term Loans of a Non-Consenting Lender removed prior to the one-year anniversary of the Amendment and Restatement Effective Date, the premium that would have been payable to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(c) had such Lender's U.S. Tranche B Term Loans or Euro Tranche B Term Loans been prepaid on such date), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts).

          As a result of the CAM Exchange, on and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Designated Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages (to be redetermined as of each such date of payment or distribution to the extent required by the next paragraph below).
          In the event that, on or after the CAM Exchange Date, the aggregate amount of the Designated Obligations shall change as a result of the making of an LC Disbursement that is not reimbursed by any Borrower, then (i) each Revolving Lender shall, in accordance with Section 2.06(e), promptly pay its Applicable Percentage of such LC Disbursement to the relevant Issuing Bank in respect of such unreimbursed LC Disbursement (without giving effect to the CAM Exchange), (ii) the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the CAM Percentages after giving effect to such disbursement and the making of such payments and the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have exchanged interests in the Designated Obligations such that each Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in the Designated Obligations under each of the Tranches (and the interests in the Designated Obligations to be received in such deemed exchange shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the Dollar Amount of such amount in accordance with the first sentence of the preceding paragraph), and (iii) in the event distributions shall have previously been made with respect to the Designated Obligations in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Lenders shall make such payments to one another as shall be necessary in order that the amounts received by them shall be equal to the amounts they would have received had each such LC Disbursement been outstanding on the CAM Exchange Date. Each such redetermination shall be binding on each of the Lenders and their successors and assigns and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
          (a) Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
          (b) The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
 
          (c) To the extent required by any applicable law, the Agents may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that an Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Agent (to the extent that the Agent has not already been reimbursed by any Borrower and without limiting or expanding the obligation of any Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any interest, additions to Tax or penalties thereto, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Government Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein) or in the absence of its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
 
sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.
          (f) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
          (g) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company and (unless a Specified Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) with the consent of the Company (which consent of the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent from among the Lenders which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by any Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between such Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
          (h) Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
     (i) The Lenders irrevocably agree:
     (i) that any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (A) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations or, solely in the case of any Lien solely for the Foreign Obligations, the Foreign Obligations (in each case, other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements, (y) Cash Management Obligations and (z) contingent reimbursement and indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (B) at the time the Property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person (other than (x) in the case of a transfer by a U.S. Loan Party, any transfer to another U.S. Loan Party and (y) in the case of a transfer by a Foreign Loan Party, any transfer to another Foreign Loan Party), (C) subject to Section 9.02, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02), or (D) if the Property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement pursuant to clause (iii) below;
     (ii) (A) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(e) and (B) that the Administrative Agent is authorized (but not required) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such Property that is permitted by any other clause of Section 6.02; and
     (iii) that any Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder.
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02) will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of Property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (h). In each case as specified in this paragraph (h), the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Company's expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this paragraph (h).
          (j) None of the Persons, if any, identified in this Agreement as an Arranger, Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.
 
Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Persons in their respective capacities as an Arranger, Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.

Parallel Debt
     (ii) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges that (i) for this purpose, the Parallel Debt of the Euro Borrower constitutes undertakings, obligations and liabilities of the Euro Borrower to the Administrative Agent which are separate and independent from, and without prejudice to, the Foreign Obligations which the Euro Borrower owes to any Lender or Issuing Bank and (ii) that the Parallel Debt represents the Administrative Agent's own claim to receive payment of such Parallel Debt by the Euro Borrower; that the total amount which may become due under the Parallel Debt of the Euro Borrower under this clause (k) shall never exceed the total amount which may become due under all the Foreign Obligations of the Euro Borrower to all the Lenders and the Issuing Bank.
provided
     (iii) (A) The total amount due by the Euro Borrower as the Parallel Debt under this clause (k) shall be decreased to the extent that the Euro Borrower shall have irrevocably and unconditionally paid any amounts to the Lenders and the Issuing Bank or any of them to reduce the Euro Borrower's outstanding Foreign Obligations or any Lender or Issuing Bank otherwise receives any amount in irrevocable and unconditional payment of such Foreign Obligations (other than by virtue of paragraph (B) hereafter); and
     (B) To the extent that the Euro Borrower shall have irrevocably and unconditionally paid any amounts to the Administrative Agent under the Parallel Debt or the Administrative Agent shall have otherwise received monies in irrevocable and unconditional payment of such Parallel Debt, the total amount due under the Foreign Obligations shall be decreased.

     (A) will be the joint and several creditor (together with the relevant Lenders and the Issuing Bank) of each and every obligation of the Foreign Borrower towards each Lender and the Issuing Bank under this Agreement; and
     (B) will have its own independent right to demand performance by the Euro Borrower of those obligations.
     (ii) Discharge by the Euro Borrower of any obligation owed to the Administrative Agent or another Lender and the Issuing Bank shall, to the same extent, discharge the corresponding obligation owing to the other.
     (iii) Without limiting or affecting the Administrative Agent's rights against the Euro Borrower (whether under this Article VIII or under any other provision of the Credit Agreement), the Administrative Agent agrees with each other Lender and the Issuing Bank (on a several and divided basis) that, subject to paragraph (iv) below, it will not exercise its rights as a joint and several creditor with a Lender or an Issuing Bank except with the consent of the relevant Lender or Issuing Bank.
     (iv) Nothing in paragraph (iii) above shall in any way limit the Administrative Agent's right to act in the protection or preservation of rights under or to enforce any Collateral Document as contemplated by this Agreement and/or the relevant Collateral Document (or to do any act reasonably incidental to any of the above).

Waivers; Amendments
          (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other
 
Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
          (b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (with respect to such Loan Document), neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or the waiver of any Default or mandatory prepayment shall not constitute an increase of any Commitment of any Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest or premium thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, it being understood that any change to the definition of "Consolidated Leverage Ratio" or in the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in the rate; that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend Section 2.13(c) or to waive any obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest at the rate set forth therein, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, it being understood that the waiver of (or amendment to the terms of) any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans shall not constitute a postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of principal or interest, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) or the provisions of the CAM Exchange in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreements, without the written consent of each Lender or (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien of the Collateral Documents, without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder which does not require the consent of each affected Lender (it being understood that any Commitments or Loans held or deemed held by any

further
 
Defaulting Lender shall be excluded for a vote of the Lenders hereunder requiring any consent of less than all affected Lenders).
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans and Revolving Credit Exposures and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.
          In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Lenders providing the Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to permit the refinancing of all outstanding Term Loans of any Class ("") with a replacement term loan tranche denominated in Dollars or, in the case of the Euro Tranche A Term Loan or Euro Tranche B Term Loan, in Euros ("") hereunder; that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced Term Loans, (b) the Applicable Rate for such Replacement Term Loans shall not be higher than the Applicable Rate for such Refinanced Term Loans, (c) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such refinancing (except to the extent of nominal amortization for periods where amortization has been eliminated as a result of prepayment of the Term Loans) and (d) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the latest final maturity of the Term Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing.
