The Agreement sets forth the terms of the consultancy (including a monthly fee of $20,833.33 payable to Mr. Prasad) and also amends the Shareholders Agreement between the parties to extend by one year the term during which Mr. Prasad and his affiliates will continue to hold shares of Matrix Laboratories Limited and to vote such shares in accordance with the Company's directions (in each case subject to the exceptions set forth in the Shareholders Agreement). The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement.
