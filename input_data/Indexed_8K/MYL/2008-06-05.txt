On June 5, 2008, Mylan Inc.'s subsidiary Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. entered into a settlement and license agreement with Abbott Laboratories relating to Divalproex Extended-release (ER) Tablets, the generic version of Abbott's Depakote ER. Mylan will enjoy a 180-day exclusivity period on the 500 mg strength upon launching, which will occur no later than January 1, 2009. This agreement also provides a license for the 250 mg strength also to be launched no later than January 1, 2009. All litigation between Mylan and Abbott relating to Divalproex ER Tablets will be dismissed.
Divalproex ER Tablets had U.S. sales of approximately $825 million for the 12 months ending March 31, 2008, with $722 million on the 500 mg and $103 million on the 250 mg.
Currently, Mylan has 73 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 21 of which are potential first-to-file opportunities.
