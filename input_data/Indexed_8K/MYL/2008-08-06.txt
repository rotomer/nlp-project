Exhibit 99.1
PITTSBURGHAugust 6, 2008Mylan Inc. (NYSE: MYL) today announced its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.
Financial Highlights
"Our strong second quarter results were driven by a solid performance by each of our operating units and reflect the value we anticipated when we created our global platform," said Mylan Vice Chairman and CEO Robert J. Coury. "Based on the strength of our operations, our integration successes and the momentum of three consecutive quarters of strong results, we have increased the range of our earnings guidance."
Detailed Financial Summary
Mylan previously had two reportable segments, the Mylan Segment and the Matrix Segment. With the acquisition of Merck Generics on October 2, 2007, Mylan now has three reportable segments: Generics Segment (or Generics), Specialty Segment (or Specialty) and the Matrix Segment (or Matrix). The former Mylan Segment is included within the Generics Segment. Additionally, certain general and administrative and research and development expenses not allocated to the segments, as well as litigation settlements, purchase accounting related items and non-operating income and expenses are reported in Corporate/Other.
Total revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 increased by $656.8 million to $1.20 billion from $546.3 million in the same prior year period. Approximately $669.3 million represents amounts contributed through the acquisition of Merck Generics.
Generics Segment revenues were $992.9 million and are derived from sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa (collectively, "EMEA"), North America and Asia Pacific.
Total revenues from North America were $461.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008 compared to $455.0 million for the same prior year period, representing an increase of $6.8 million. Revenues of approximately $32.4 million were realized in North America in the current quarter as a result of the acquisition of Merck Generics. Excluding these amounts, total revenues decreased by $25.6 million from the same prior year period.
 
This decrease in revenues is driven by the timing of exclusive product launches and overall unfavorable pricing, partially offset by favorable volume and revenue from new products. In the current year, new products launched in the U.S. contributed revenues of $75.6 million, consisting primarily of paroxetine ER and felodipine ER. In the prior year, the Company received a significant contribution to revenue from amlodipine and oxybutynin, both of which had exclusivity for a portion of the quarter. Generic competition on certain products in the Company's portfolio, including amlodipine, was responsible for the unfavorable pricing realized in the current period.
Total revenues from EMEA and Asia Pacific, as well as revenues from the Specialty Segment, were all the result of the acquisition of Merck Generics. For EMEA, revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 were $389.8 million, the majority of which are derived from the three largest markets; France, the United Kingdom and Germany. Total revenues from Asia Pacific were $141.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008, and were derived from Mylan's newly acquired operations in Australia, Japan and New Zealand.
The Matrix Segment reported third-party revenues of $104.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008 compared to $91.3 million for the same prior year period, representing an increase of $13.3 million or 15%. This increase is the result of growth in the anti-retroviral franchise, with higher sales of both API and finished dosage form products, the latter of which Matrix began to produce and sell in late calendar year 2007.
For the Specialty Segment, total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2008, were $116.0 million of which $105.9 million represented sales to third-parties. The Specialty Segment consists of the Dey business that focuses on the development, manufacturing and marketing of specialty pharmaceuticals in the respiratory and severe allergy markets. On February 27, 2008 the Company announced that it was reviewing strategic alternatives for Dey, including the potential sale of the business.
Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was $414.2 million and gross margins were 34.4%. Gross margins were negatively impacted by certain purchase accounting items recorded during the quarter of approximately $112.1 million, which consisted primarily of amortization related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of Merck Generics. Excluding such items, gross margins were 43.7%. Gross margins in the same prior year period, also adjusted to exclude certain purchase accounting items, would have been 57.7%. This decrease is due to the fact that, on average, the newly acquired Merck Generics entities, particularly in countries outside of the United States, contribute margins that are lower than those realized by Mylan's domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, current quarter margins were negatively impacted by competition on certain products including amlodipine and oxybutynin during the past twelve months.
The Company reported earnings from operations of $74.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Excluding the purchase accounting items discussed above, earnings from operations would have been $186.1 million.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, Mylan reported earnings from operations of $188.1 million. Excluding the purchase accounting items discussed above, earnings from operations would have been $206.9 million. This represents a current year decrease of $20.8 million or 10.0%, which is the result of increased research and development ("R&D") expense and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses.
 
R&D expense was $80.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008, compared to $31.7 million in the same prior year period. R&D expense includes approximately $40.9 million related to newly acquired entities, all of which was incremental to the comparable prior year period. Excluding this amount, R&D expense increased by $8.1 million or 26% primarily as a result of increased ANDA submissions.
SG&A expense for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was $259.5 million compared to $76.9 million in the same prior year period. SG&A expense includes approximately $152.9 million related to newly acquired entities, all of which was incremental to the comparable prior year period. Excluding this amount, SG&A expense increased by $29.5 million or 38%. The majority of this increase was realized by Corporate and Other, and is the result of costs associated with the integration of Merck Generics, as well as higher payroll and related costs principally attributable to the build-up of additional corporate infrastructure as a direct result of the acquisition.
Interest expense for the current quarter totaled $86.5 million compared to $22.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007. The increase is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of Merck Generics.
Other income, net, was $7.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008, compared to net expense of $36.4 million in the same prior year period. The comparable quarter of 2007 included a $57.5 million non-cash mark to market unrealized loss on a deal-contingent foreign currency option contract that was entered into for the then pending acquisition of Merck Generics. Excluding this unrealized loss, the decrease in other income, net, in the current year is due primarily to lower interest and dividend income as a result of lower cash and available for sale securities.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Mylan is disclosing non-GAAP financial measures when providing financial results. Primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, Mylan is disclosing non-GAAP results that exclude items such as amortization expense and other costs directly associated with the acquisitions as well as certain other non-recurring expenses in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the Company's financial performance because the Company's management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. Whenever Mylan uses such a non-GAAP measure, it will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most closely applicable GAAP measure set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Below is a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings available to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS to GAAP net (loss) earnings available to common shareholders and diluted EPS:
