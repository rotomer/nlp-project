Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     Mylan Inc. (the "Company") entered into an indenture, dated as of May 19, 2010 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, which governs the terms of the Company's $550 million 7.625% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $700 million 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") that were issued on the same date.
     The Notes were issued in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A and to persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries.
     The 2017 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.625% per year, accruing from May 19, 2010. Interest on the 2017 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2011. The 2017 Notes will mature on July 15, 2017, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.875% per year, accruing from May 19, 2010. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2011. The 2020 Notes will mature on July 15, 2020, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
     The Company may redeem some or all of the 2017 Notes at any time prior to July 15, 2014, and some or all of the 2020 Notes at any time prior to July 15, 2015, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and an applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture. On or after July 15, 2014 in the case of the 2017 Notes, and on or after July 15, 2015 in the case of the 2020 Notes, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes of such series at redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to July 15, 2013, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of either series of Notes at a specified redemption price set forth in the Indenture with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. If the Company experiences certain change of control events, it must offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
     The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments; make certain investments; agree to payment restrictions on the Company's subsidiaries; sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of the Company's subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; create liens; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of the Company's assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications, including the fall away or revision of certain of these covenants as they relate to a series of Notes upon such series receiving investment grade credit ratings.
 
     The Company is using $1.0 billion of the net proceeds of the Notes offering to prepay a portion of the U.S. dollar-denominated Tranche B Term Loans under its senior secured credit facility, thereby reducing senior secured leverage and extending the maturity profile of its outstanding indebtedness, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The weighted average interest rate applicable to the borrowings being repaid, after giving effect to any interest rate hedging, was 5.6% as of March 31, 2010.
     The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms of the Indenture, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, and the Notes, the forms of which are contained in Exhibit 4.1, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     The information included in Item 1.01 with respect to the Notes is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

However, to the extent any provision of any Note conflicts with the express provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Indenture shall control and be binding.
     The Notes may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the Registrar.
     The Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President or any Vice President. The signature of any of these officers on the Notes may be manual or facsimile.
     If an Officer whose signature is on a Note was an Officer at the time of such execution but no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid nevertheless.
     No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

     The Notes shall be issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the ""), and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment (the "") and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Company, if any, in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served.

Registrar
Paying Agent
     The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent that is not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such Agent. If the
 
Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, or fails to give the foregoing notice, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation in accordance with Section 7.06 hereof.
     The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar, Paying Agent and Agent for service of notices and demands in connection with the Notes and this Indenture, and the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as the office or agency of the Company for such purposes, and the Company may change the Paying Agent without prior notice to the Holders. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent.
     Each Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or premium or interest on the Notes (whether such money has been paid to it by the Company or any other obligor on the Notes), and the Company and the Paying Agent shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company (or any other obligor on the Notes) in making any such payment. Money held in trust by the Paying Agent need not be segregated except as required by law and in no event shall the Paying Agent be liable for any interest on any money received by it hereunder; that if the Company or an Affiliate thereof acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold such money in a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require the Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and account for any funds disbursed, and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) hereof, upon written request to the Paying Agent, require the Paying Agent to pay forthwith all money so held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed. Upon making such payment, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
provided
     The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of the Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders; that, as long as the Trustee is the Registrar, no such list need be furnished.
provided
     Subject to Sections 2.16 and 2.17 hereof, when Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request from the Holder of such Notes to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations of the same series, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested. Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorneys duly authorized in writing. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall issue and execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate, new Notes evidencing such transfer or exchange at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made to the Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange. The Company may require from the Holder payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer taxes or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation to a transfer or exchange, but this provision shall not apply to any exchange pursuant to Section 2.11, 3.06 or 8.05 hereof (in which events the Company shall be responsible for the payment of such taxes). The Registrar shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of
 
any Note for a period of 15 days immediately preceding the redemption of Notes, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.
     Any Holder of a Global Note shall, by acceptance of such Global Note, agree that transfers of the beneficial interests in such Global Note may be effected only through a book entry system maintained by the Holder of such Global Note (or its agent), and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Global Note shall be required to be reflected in a book entry system.
     If a mutilated Note is surrendered to the Registrar or the Trustee, or if the Holder of a Note claims that the Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Holder of such Note furnishes to the Company and the Trustee evidence reasonably acceptable to them of the ownership and the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date of this Indenture are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity bond shall be posted, sufficient in the judgment of all to protect the Company, the Trustee or any Paying Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if such Note is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for the Company's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in replacing such Note and the Trustee may charge the Company for the Trustee's expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) in replacing such Note. Every replacement Note shall constitute a contractual obligation of the Company.
     The Notes outstanding at any time are all Notes that have been authenticated by the Trustee except for (a) those canceled by it, (b) those delivered to it for cancellation, (c) to the extent set forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 hereof, on or after the date on which the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 or 9.02 hereof have been satisfied, those Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered by the Trustee hereunder and (d) those described in this Section 2.09 as not outstanding. Subject to Section 2.10 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds the Note.
     If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser in whose hands such Note is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company.
     If the Paying Agent holds, in its capacity as such, on any Maturity Date, money sufficient to pay all accrued interest and principal with respect to the Notes payable on that date and is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders thereof pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
     In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any declaration of acceleration or notice of default or direction, waiver or consent or any amendment, modification or other change to this Indenture, Notes owned by the Company or any other Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded as though they were not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent or any amendment, modification or other change to this Indenture, only Notes as to which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actually received an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes are so owned shall be so disregarded. Notes so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee established to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to the
 
Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company any other obligor on the Notes or any of their respective Affiliates.
     Until definitive Notes are prepared and ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of definitive Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Until such exchange, temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges as definitive Notes.
     The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall deliver such canceled Notes to the Company. The Company may not reissue or resell, or issue new Notes to replace Notes that the Company has redeemed or paid, or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (other than in accordance with this Indenture).
     If the Company defaults on a payment of interest on the Notes, it shall pay the defaulted interest, (to the extent permitted by law) any interest payable on the defaulted interest, in accordance with the terms hereof, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be at least five Business Days prior to the payment date. The Company shall fix such special record date and payment date in a manner satisfactory to the Trustee. At least 10 days before such special record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest, and interest payable on defaulted interest, if any, to be paid. The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements (if applicable) of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed and, upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after written notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this sentence, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
plus
     The Company in issuing the Notes may use a "CUSIP," "ISIN" or other similar number, and if so, such CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number shall be included in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number printed in the notice or on the Notes, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any such CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number used by the Company in connection with the issuance of the Notes and of any change in the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar number.

     (1) any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) (A) that are assumed by the transferee of such assets and for which the Company and all of the Restricted Subsidiaries have been unconditionally released or (B) in respect of which neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary following such sale has any obligation;
     (2) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary within 180 days into cash, to the extent of cash received in that conversion;
     (3) all Temporary Cash Investments; and
     (4) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Total Assets.
     (d) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to clause (a)(3)(C) of this Section 4.10, the Company will purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (and such other Senior Indebtedness) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Indebtedness of the Company was issued with a significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Indebtedness) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of $2,000 principal amount or any greater integral multiple of $1,000. The Company shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 4.10 if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net Available Cash (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be reset at zero. Accordingly, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other Senior Indebtedness of the Company is less than the aggregate amount of unapplied Net Available Cash, the Company may use any remaining Net Available Cash for general corporate purposes of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

     Section 6.02 .
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission
     If an Event of Default with respect to the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) hereof with respect to the Company) shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, may declare to be immediately due and payable the principal amount of all such Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of acceleration. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) hereof with respect to the Company shall occur, such amount with respect to all the Notes shall become automatically due and payable immediately without any further action or notice. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained by the applicable person, the registered Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, then outstanding may cancel such acceleration if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (ii) if all
 
existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, that has become due solely because of the acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
     Subject to Section 7.01 hereof, in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity. Subject to Section 7.06 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, then outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power the Trustee holds with respect to the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be.
     Section 6.03
Other Remedies.
     If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, as the case may be, or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture and may take any necessary action requested of it as Trustee to settle, compromise, adjust or otherwise conclude any proceedings to which it is a party.
     The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. Any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee may be brought in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements of the Trustee and its counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative, to the extent permitted by law. Any costs associated with actions taken by the Trustee under this Section 6.03 shall be reimbursed to the Trustee by the Company.

     Provided the Notes are not then due and payable by reason of a declaration of acceleration, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, may on behalf of the Holders of all the affected 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, waive any past Default with respect to the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, and its consequences by providing written notice thereof to the Company and the Trustee, except a Default (1) in the payment of interest on or the principal of any Note or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under this Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Note affected. In the case of any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, will be restored to their former positions and rights under this Indenture, respectively; that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
provided
     Section 6.05
Control by Majority.
     The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect
 
to Notes of such series. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that may involve the Trustee in personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Holders of the affected Notes not joining in the giving of such direction and may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes.
     Section 6.06
Limitation on Suits.
     No Holder of 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as applicable, will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to this Indenture, or for any remedy hereunder, unless:
     (1) the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding for 60 days after the Holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Notes,
     (2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, have made a written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee; and
     (3) the Trustee has not received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, a direction that is inconsistent with such request.
     However, the Holder of any Note will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on, such Note on or after the date or dates they are to be paid as expressed in such Note and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment.
     Section 6.07
Rights of Holders To Receive Payment.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase) or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment, on or after the due date expressed in the Notes shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
     Section 6.08
Collection Suit by Trustee.
     If an Event of Default in payment of principal, premium or interest specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company (or any other obligor on the Notes) for the whole amount of unpaid principal and accrued interest remaining unpaid.
     Section 6.09
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06 hereof) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law, shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same after deduction of its charges and expenses to
 
the extent that any such charges and expenses are not paid out of the estate in any such proceedings and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06 hereof.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan or reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceedings. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
     Section 6.10
Priorities.

     SECOND: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the affected Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest as to each, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the affected Notes; and
     THIRD: to the Company.
     The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.
     Section 6.11
Undertaking for Costs.
     In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.
     Section 6.12
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Notes to exercise any right or remedy occurring upon an Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article 6
 
or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
     Section 7.01
Duties of Trustee.
     (a) If an Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
     (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
     (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

     (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     (1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of clause (b) or (d) of this Section 7.01;
     (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
     (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series, determined as provided herein, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Notes of such series.
     (d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
     (e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01.

     (h) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the

     (j) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of such Default or Event of Default from the Company or any Holder is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.
     (k) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.

     Section 7.03
Individual Rights of Trustee.
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may make loans to, accept deposits from, perform services for or otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate thereof with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.
     Any Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee is also subject to Section 7.09 hereof.

     Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a board resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.05 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture, in which case the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
     Section 8.02
With Consent of Holders.
     (a) The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may modify or amend this Indenture as it applies to a series of Notes with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series affected by the modification (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes of such series), and any past default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture relating to a series of Notes may also be waived (except a default in the payment of principal, premium or interest and a default under clause (b) of this Section 8.02) with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series.
     (b) However, no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes of a series affected thereby:
     (1) change the due date of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, the Notes of such series;
     (2) reduce the principal amount of, or any premium or interest rate on, the Notes of such series;
 
     (3) change the place or currency of payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Notes of such series;
     (4) (i) reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Note of such series or (ii) change the time at which any Note of such series may be redeemed, in each case as described under Section 3.07 hereof;
     (5) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee of such series or this Indenture otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this Indenture;
     (6) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Notes of such series, after the due date thereof; or
     (7) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series, the consent of whose Holders is required for modification or amendment of this Indenture, for waiver of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or for waiver of certain defaults.
     (c) The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of then outstanding Notes of a series may waive future compliance by the Company with certain restrictive covenants of this Indenture applicable to such series of Notes. The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes of a series may waive any past default under this Indenture, except a failure by the Company to pay the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Notes of such series or a provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holders of all outstanding Notes of such series.
     (d) In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of a series of Notes have concurred in any direction, notice, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, or by any Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary, will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in conclusively relying on any such direction, notice, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned will be so disregarded.
     (e) It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     After an amendment that requires the consent of the Holders of the affected Notes becomes effective, the Company shall mail to each registered Holder of the affected Notes at such Holder's address appearing in the security register a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders of such Notes, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.
     Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a board resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the receipt by the Trustee of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture, in which case the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
 
     Section 8.03
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
     After an amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent conclusive and binding upon such Holder and every subsequent Holder of the same Note or portion thereof, and of any Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in place thereof, even if notation of the consent is not made on any such Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
     The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement, or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then, notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement, or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless the consent of the requisite number of Holders has been obtained.
     Section 8.04
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
     If an amendment, supplement, or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee (in accordance with the specific written direction of the Company) shall request the Holder of the Note (in accordance with the specific written direction of the Company) to deliver it to the Trustee. In such case, the Trustee shall place an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
     Section 8.05
Trustee To Sign Amendments, etc.
     The Trustee shall sign any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 8 if the amendment, supplement or waiver does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee, the Trustee may, but need not, sign such amendment, supplement or waiver. In signing or refusing to sign such amendment, supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 7.01 hereof, shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating, in addition to the matters required by Section 11.02 hereof, that such amendment, supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
     Section 9.01
Satisfaction and Discharge of Liability on Notes; Defeasance.
     (a) This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes which shall survive until all Notes have been canceled) as to all outstanding 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, when:
     (1) either:
 
     (A) all the 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from this trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or
     (B) all 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation otherwise (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable, or may be called for redemption, within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption pursuant to the provisions described under Section 3.07(a) or (b), as the case may be, or Section 3.07(d) hereof and, in any case, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of such Notes, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness (including all principal and accrued interest) on the Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
     (2) in respect of clause (a)(1)(B) of this Section 9.01, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness) or the granting of Liens in connection therewith) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is bound (other than with respect to the borrowing of funds to be applied concurrently to make the deposit required to effect such satisfaction and discharge (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness) or the granting of Liens in connection therewith),
     (3) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture, and
     (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, at maturity or on the date of redemption, as the case may be.

     (b) Subject to clause (c) of this Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 hereof, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be (""). Legal Defeasance means that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Notes of such series and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, and this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding Notes of such series and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, except as to:
Legal Defeasance
     (1) the rights of Holders of such series of Notes issued under this Indenture to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to this Indenture;
 
     (2) the Company's obligations with respect to the 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, concerning issuing temporary Notes under Section 2.11 hereof, registration of Notes under Section 2.04 hereof, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes under Section 2.08 hereof, and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment under Section 2.04 hereof and money for security payments held in trust under Section 2.05 hereof;
     (3) the rights, powers, trust, duties, and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company's obligation in connection therewith; and

The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.
Covenant Defeasance
     (c) If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto.
     (d) Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.

Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.06, 9.05 and 9.06 shall survive.
     Section 9.02
Conditions to Defeasance
     In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be:
     (a) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the Company, to pay the principal of and interest on the 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, on the stated date for payment or on the Redemption Date of the principal or installment of principal of or interest on such Notes;
     (b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions:
 
     (1) the Company has received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling; or
     (2) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon this Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
     (c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
     (d) no Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to make such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness) or the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;
     (e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a Default under this Indenture or a default under any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound (other than any such Default or default resulting solely from the borrowing of funds and the grant of any related liens to be applied to such deposit);
     (f) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by it with the intent of preferring the Holders of such series over any other of its creditors or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or others; and
     (g) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel in the United States (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02, the conditions set forth in the foregoing subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) need not be satisfied so long as, at the time the Company makes the deposit described in subsection (a), (i) no Default under clauses (1), (2), (8) and (9) under Section 6.01 hereof has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit and after giving effect thereto, and (ii) either (x) a notice of redemption has been mailed providing for redemption of all the Notes of such series not more than 60 days after such mailing and the requirements for such redemption shall have been complied with or (y) the Stated Maturity of the Notes of such series will occur within 60 days. If the conditions in the preceding sentence are satisfied, the Company shall be deemed to have exercised its Covenant Defeasance option.
     If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the 2017 Notes or 2020 Notes, as the case may be, when due, then the
 
Company's obligations and the obligations of Subsidiary Guarantors under this Indenture will be revived and no such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.
     Section 9.03 .
Deposited Money and Government Obligations To Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions
     All money and Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.02(a) hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent, to the Holders of such Notes, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

Reinstatement
     If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 9.01 hereof by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 9 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 9.01 hereof; that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or accrued interest on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

provided
     Section 10.01
Guarantee.
     (a) Each Subsidiary Guarantor, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the Notes and obligations of the Company hereunder and thereunder, and guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and to the Trustee on behalf of such Holder, that (i) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise (including, without limitation, the amount that would become due but for the operation of any automatic stay provision of any Bankruptcy Law), together with interest on the overdue principal, if any, and interest on any overdue interest, to the extent lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or of any such other obligations, the same will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, subject, however, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the limitations set forth in Section 10.03 hereof.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Subsidiary Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Subsidiary Guarantor.
     (b) Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other Person, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be discharged as to either the 2017 Notes or the 2020 Notes, as the case may be, except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Note, this Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges that the Subsidiary Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest on such Note, whether at its
 
Stated Maturity, by acceleration, purchase or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Note, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Indenture, directly against each of the Subsidiary Guarantors to enforce such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders are prevented by applicable law from exercising their respective rights to accelerate the maturity of the Notes, to collect interest on the Notes, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Notes, such Subsidiary Guarantor will pay to the Trustee for the account of the Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of the Holders.
     (c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any amount paid by any of them to the Trustee or such Holder, the Subsidiary Guarantee of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between each Subsidiary Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) subject to this Article 10, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
     (d) Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes are, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Notes, whether as a "voidable preference", "fraudulent transfer" or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Notes shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
     (e) To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that a Notation of Guarantee substantially in the form attached as hereto will be endorsed by an Officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered to the Trustee and that this Indenture or a supplemental indenture to this Indenture will be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by one of its Officers. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a Notation of Guarantee. The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will be deemed to constitute due delivery of the Notation of Guarantee set forth in this Indenture by the Subsidiary Guarantors. If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Notation of Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Notation of Guarantee is endorsed, the Notation of Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and each such Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount that will not, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee or pursuant to this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
