On November 14, 2011, Mylan Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "Senior Credit Agreement") among the Company, certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), pursuant to which the Company borrowed $1,250,000,000 in U.S. Term Loans (the "Term Loans"). The proceeds of the Term Loans were used to refinance the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December 20, 2007 (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), among the Company, Mylan Luxembourg 5 S. r.l., the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and to pay the related fees, costs and expenses in respect of the foregoing and in connection with the foregoing transactions. The termination of the Existing Credit Agreement was concurrent with, and contingent upon, the effectiveness of the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement also contains a $1,250,000,000 revolving facility (the "Revolving Facility" and, together with the Term Loans, the "Senior Credit Facilities") under which the Company may obtain extensions of credit, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and consisting of a $750 million U.S. dollar-denominated tranche (the "U.S. Revolving Facility") and a $500 million alternative currency tranche (the "Alternative Currency Revolving Facility"). The U.S. Revolving Facility is available to the Company for borrowings in U.S. Dollars, and the Alternative Currency Revolving Facility is available to the Company for borrowings in U.S. Dollars, euros, Sterling, Yen and such other currencies as are acceptable to each lender under the Alternative Currency Revolving Facility and the Administrative Agent. The Revolving Facility includes a $125 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit and a $100 million subfacility for swingline borrowings. The Company may incur additional term loan commitments or increases in the amount of the commitments under the Revolving Facility (the "Incremental Commitments") in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750 million plus any previously made scheduled or voluntary (other than any debt refinanced) principal payments of Term Loans from Lenders or other financial institutions designated by the Company, to the extent agreed by such Lenders or other financial institutions and consented to by the Administrative Agent. The Senior Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The Senior Credit Facilities are also secured by a pledge of the capital stock of substantially all direct subsidiaries of the Company and the Guarantors (limited to 65% of outstanding voting stock of foreign holding companies and any foreign subsidiaries) and substantially all of the other tangible and intangible property and assets of the Company and the Guarantors.
The Term Loans currently bear interest at LIBOR (determined in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) plus 2.00% per annum, if the Company chooses to make LIBOR borrowings, or at a base rate (determined in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) plus 1.00% per annum. The applicable margins over LIBOR and the base rate for the Revolving Facility and the Term Loans can fluctuate based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Company also pays a facility fee on the entire amount of the Revolving Facility. The facility fee is currently 0.40% per annum, but can decrease to 0.30% per annum based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants for facilities of this type, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements,
notices of default and certain other material events, maintenance of business and insurance, collateral matters and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants for facilities of this type, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, mergers and certain other fundamental changes, investments and loans, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, dispositions of assets, payments of dividends and other restricted payments, prepayments or amendments to the terms of specified indebtedness and changes in our lines of business. The Senior Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio. These financial covenants are not to be tested earlier than the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
The Senior Credit Agreement contains default provisions customary for facilities of this type, which are subject to customary grace periods and materiality thresholds, including, among others, defaults related to payment failures, failure to comply with covenants, material misrepresentations, defaults under other material indebtedness or the occurrence of a "change of control", bankruptcy and related events, material judgments, certain events related to pension plans, and invalidity of guarantee and security agreements. If an event of default occurs under the Senior Credit Agreement, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments, declare immediately payable all borrowings and foreclose on the collateral.
During any period when the Company maintains an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and no default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Credit Agreement, the restrictions imposed by certain negative covenants under the Senior Credit Agreement will be suspended. Additionally, during such time the Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, require that all collateral then in effect be released from the security interest created pursuant to the security documents so long as no Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) secured by a lien on any assets of the Company or any of the Guarantors is outstanding (or any such lien is contemporaneously released). Upon the occurrence of a ratings downgrade by either S&P or Moody's to a level below investment grade status or upon the Company ceasing to have a corporate credit rating by either such agency (or a successor thereto), the collateral is required to be reinstated.
The Term Loans mature on November 14, 2016 and require amortization payments of approximately $23.4 million per quarter in each of 2012 and 2013, $31.3 million per quarter in 2014, $46.9 million per quarter in 2015 and $187.5 million per quarter in 2016. The Senior Credit Agreement requires prepayments of the Term Loans with the proceeds from (1) certain asset sales and casualty events, unless the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 3.25 to 1.0, and (2) the proceeds from certain issuances of indebtedness not permitted by the Senior Credit Agreement. Amounts drawn on the Revolving Facility become due and payable on November 14, 2016. The Term Loans and amounts drawn on the Revolving Facility may be voluntarily prepaid without penalty or premium.

Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any telephonic Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Loan Borrowing (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, the Swingline Lender shall make such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(c), by remittance to the relevant Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
(c) (i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each U.S. Revolving Lender, in the case of U.S. Swingline Loans, or Alternative Currency Revolving Lender, in the case of Alternative Currency Swingline Loans, make an Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of the applicable Class of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02 and Section 2.03, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments of the applicable Class and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Borrowing Request promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each U.S. Revolving Lender, in the case of U.S. Swingline Loans, or Alternative Currency Revolving Lender, in the case of Alternative Currency Swingline Loans, shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Borrowing Request available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office for Dollar-denominated payments not
 
later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Borrowing Request, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made an Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender.
(ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such Base Rate Loan in accordance with clause (i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the U.S. Revolving Lenders, in the case of U.S. Swingline Loans, or Alternative Currency Revolving Lenders, in the case of Alternative Currency Swingline Loans, fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and such Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Lender's Base Rate Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(iii) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Base Rate Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; , , that each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Base Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
provided
however
(d) (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender.
(ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.08 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each U.S. Revolving Lender, in the case of U.S. Swingline Loans, or each Alternative Currency Revolving Lender, in the case of Alternative Currency Swingline Loans, shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e) The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.
(f) The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.

receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower will reimburse such Issuing Bank in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Issuing Bank in Dollars.
(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a U.S. Letter of Credit that is not fully refinanced by a U.S. Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank an U.S. L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which U.S. L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each U.S. Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such U.S. L/C Borrowing and shall constitute a U.S. L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.05. With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit that is not fully refinanced by an Alternative Currency Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank an Alternative Currency L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which Alternative Currency L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Alternative Currency Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an Alternative Currency L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.05.
(iv) Until each applicable Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such Issuing Bank.
 
(v) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse each Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit of the applicable Class issued by it, as contemplated by this Section 2.05(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against such Issuing Bank, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; , , that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Borrowing Request). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse an Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

(vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(c) by the time specified in Section 2.05(c)(ii), such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Lender's Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of an Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.08 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank in its discretion), each U.S. Revolving Credit Lender, in the case of a U.S. Letter of Credit, or any Alternative Currency Revolving Credit Lender, in the case of an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.

Each Revolving Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under any Letter of Credit, no Issuing Bank shall have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; , , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in any currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other currency) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in any currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other currency) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in any currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other currency), in each case by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material in the context of its making of, and participation in, extensions of credit under this Agreement, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days (or such later date as may be agreed by the applicable Lender) after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this
provided
 
Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 135 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 135-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10 and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (excluding loss of anticipated profit) attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender may be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (and excluding any Applicable Rate), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market.

SECTION 2.16. .
Taxes
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes unless required by applicable Laws. If any applicable withholding agent shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions have been made (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section), and any other Other Taxes, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that is legally entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any such documentation (including any specific documentation referred to in the paragraph below) obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to do so.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any Loan made to the Company, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

provided
(v) any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, and

Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f) If the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender determines, in its sole good faith discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall promptly pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. The Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender shall, at the Borrower's request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority ( that the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender may delete any information therein that the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender deems confidential). This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

SECTION 2.17. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recapment or setoff prior to (i) in the case of payments by the Borrower denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in an Alternative Currency, 2:00 p.m., Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to Dollars, in Dollars) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices for Dollar denominated Credit Events or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Administrative Agent's Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Alternative Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the "
Original
 
") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
Currency
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably based on the Dollar Equivalent amount thereof among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably based on the Dollar Equivalent amount thereof among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant in accordance with Section 9.04. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (e) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.17 or 9.03, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payments.
 
SECTION 2.18. .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Any Lender claiming reimbursement of such costs and expenses shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth such costs and expenses in reasonable detail which shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, if any Lender fails to grant a consent in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 9.02 for which the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender is required but the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, but excluding the consents required by, Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.04 (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent);
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.15) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.19. .
Expansion Option
(a) The Borrower may from time to time after the Closing Date elect to increase the U.S. Revolving Commitments, Alternative Currency Revolving Commitments or any Extended Revolving Commitments ("") or enter into one or more tranches of term loans denominated in Dollars or Euros (each, an ""), in each case in an aggregate principal amount of not less than the Dollar Equivalent of $25,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such Increased Commitments and all such Incremental Term Loans (other than Refinancing Term Loans) does not exceed the excess of (i) the sum of (A) the Dollar Equivalent of $750,000,000 and (B) the amount of U.S. Term Loans previously repaid pursuant to Section 2.09 or prepaid pursuant to Section 2.10(a) (other than from the proceeds of other Indebtedness) over (ii) the
Increased Commitments
Incremental Term Loan
 
aggregate principal amount of Incremental Substitute Indebtedness previously incurred by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The Borrower may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its U.S. Revolving Commitment, Alternative Currency Revovling Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loan, an ""), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an ""), to increase their existing U.S. Revolving Commitment, Alternative Currency Revovling Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loan, or extend U.S/ Revolving Commitments, Alternative Currency Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments, as the case may be; that each Augmenting Lender (and, in the case of an Increased Commitment, each Increasing Lender) shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, in the case of an Increased Commitment, each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Without the consent of any Lenders other than the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.19. Increases of U.S. Revolving Commitments, Alternative Currency Revolving Commitments and Extended Revolving Commitment and new Incremental Term Loans created pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the U.S. Revolving Commitments, Alternative Currency Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loans shall be permitted under this paragraph unless (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase in the U.S. Revolving Commitments, Alternative Currency Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments or borrowing of such Incremental Term Loan, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower and (ii) (x) the Borrower shall be in compliance, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (assuming for this purpose that all Increased Commitments were fully drawn), with the covenants contained in Section 6.09 as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter of the Borrower for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) prior to such time and (y) on a Pro Forma Basis, the Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio would be less than or equal to 1.5 to 1.0 as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter of the Borrower for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b). On the effective date of any increase in the U.S. Revolving Commitments, Alternative Currency Revolving Commitment or Extended Revolving Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made (assuming that any Increased Commitments were fully drawn), (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, if, on the date of such increase, there are any Revolving Loans of the applicable Class outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Increased Commitments be prepaid to the extent necessary from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder by the Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders, so that, after giving effect to such prepayments and any borrowings on such date of all or any portion of such Increased Commitments, the principal balance of all outstanding Revolving Loans of such Class owing to each Lender with a Revolving Commitment of such Class is equal to such Lender's pro rata share (after giving effect to any nonratable Increased Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.19) of all then outstanding Revolving Loans of such Class. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the borrowing notice, minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the second preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The terms of any Incremental Term Loans shall be as set forth in the amendment to this Agreement providing for such Incremental Term Loans; that (i) the final maturity date of any Incremental Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term Loan Maturity Date, (ii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Incremental Term Loans shall not be shorter than the then remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the U.S. Term Loans, (iii) Incremental Term Loans shall not participate on a

For the avoidance of doubt, no Lender shall have any obligation to provide any Increased Commitment or Incremental Term Loan.

(b) This Section 2.19 shall override any provisions in Section 9.02 to the contrary.
SECTION 2.20. .
Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Commitments
(a) The Borrower may at any time and from time to time request that all or a portion of the Term Loans of any Class in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $200,000,000 (an "") be converted to extend the scheduled maturity date(s) of any payment of principal with respect to all or a portion of any principal amount of such Term Loans (any such Term Loans which have been so converted, "") and to provide for other terms consistent with this Section 2.20. In order to establish any Extended Term Loans, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders under the Existing Term Loan Class) (an "") setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Loans to be established, which shall be consistent with the Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class from which such Extended Term Loans are to be converted except that:

(ii) the interest margins with respect to the Extended Term Loans may be different than the Applicable Rate for the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Class and upfront fees may be paid to the Extending Term Lenders to the extent provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment; and
(iii) the Additional Credit Extension Amendment may provide for other covenants and terms that apply only after the Term Loan Maturity Date.
(b) Any Extended Term Loans converted pursuant to any Extension Request shall be designated a series of Extended Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; that, subject to the limitations set forth in clause (a) above, any Extended Term Loans converted from an Existing Term Loan Class may, to the extent provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment and consistent with the requirements set forth above, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans.
provided

If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition of Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent, and the Borrower in consultation with the Lenders shall, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Required Lenders in consultation with the Borrower shall, appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States; that, without the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld), the Required Lenders shall not be permitted to select a successor that is not a U.S. financial institution described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(ii) or a U.S. branch of a foreign bank described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A).

(i) To the extent required by any applicable Laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this clause (i). The agreements in this clause (i) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, a "Lender" shall, for purposes of this clause (i), include any Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank.

(i) that any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (A) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (in each case, other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements, (y) Cash Management Obligations and (z) contingent reimbursement and indemnification obligations, in each case not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination or cash collateralization of all Letters of Credit, (B) at the time the Property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person (other than in the case of a transfer by a Loan Party, any transfer to another Loan Party), (C) subject to Section 9.02, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02), or (D) if the Property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement pursuant to clause (iii) below;
(ii) (A) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(e) and (B) that the Administrative Agent is authorized (but not required) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such Property that is permitted by any other clause of Section 6.02;
(iii) that any Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder; and
(iv) (A) the Loan Parties shall be entitled to a release of all of the Liens on the Collateral upon the request of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower at any time during a Covenant Suspension Period so long as (i) no Default has then occurred and is continuing and (ii) no Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted by is outstanding (or is contemporaneously released) (a ""); that if such Covenant Suspension Period terminates, the Liens on the Collateral shall be restored, and the Loan Parties shall take all actions as may be required by the Administrative Agent to restore the Liens on all assets of the Loan Parties that would have constituted Collateral if no Covenant Suspension Period had occurred within sixty (60) days (or such longer period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) of such Covenant Suspension Period termination and (B) the Administrative Agent is authorized (but not required) to release any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document during a Collateral Suspension Period.

In each case as specified in this paragraph (j), the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the applicable Guarantee and Security Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this paragraph (j).
