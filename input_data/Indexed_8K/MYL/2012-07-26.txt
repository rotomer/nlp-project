Quarter

Adjusted Diluted EPS of
$0.60
, a
15%
Increase
Over Prior Year Quarter
Reaffirms 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $2.45 - $2.55
PITTSBURGH - July 26, 2012-Mylan Inc. (Nasdaq: MYL) today announced its financial results for the
three and six months ended
June 30, 2012
.
Financial Highlights
Mylan Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch commented: Mylan delivered another very strong quarter of top- and bottom-line growth, driven by more than 50% growth in our Specialty business, double-digit growth in North America and strong performance of our antiretroviral business. We delivered this growth while continuing to invest in our global platform, through increased spending on research and development and sales and marketing programs, in order to position our business for continued long-term success. As we look at the rest of the year, we continue to anticipate that the third quarter will be by far our strongest of the year, with a fourth quarter similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter.
John Sheehan, Mylan's Chief Financial Officer added: Our second quarter results once again demonstrate the strength and resilience of our diverse, global platform. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows, further enhancing our financial flexibility and capacity to invest in our current business, as well as other opportunities as they arise. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as well as our 2013 adjusted earnings target of $2.75 per share.
Financial Results Summary
For the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
, Mylan reported total revenues of
$1.69 billion
compared to
$1.57 billion
in the comparable prior year period. Third party revenues for the quarter ended
June 30, 2012
increased
$107.6 million
, or
6.9%
, to
$1.68 billion
from
$1.57 billion
in the comparable prior year period. The effect of foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately
5%
on third party revenues primarily reflecting a stronger U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of the other major markets in which Mylan operates. Translating third party revenues for the current quarter at prior year comparative period exchange rates would have resulted in year-over-year growth of approximately
$180 million
, or
12%
.
A tabular summary of our revenues for the
three and six months ended
June 30, 2012
, and
2011
, is included at the end of this release. Also included at the end of this release are the reconciliations of adjusted financial results to the most closely applicable GAAP financial result.
Third party net revenues from Mylan's Generics segment, which are derived from sales in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA) and Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand (collectively, Asia Pacific) were
$1.48 billion
in the quarter ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$1.44 billion
in the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$40.7 million
, or
2.8%
, or an increase of approximately
8%
when excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.
Third party net revenues from North America were
$845.3 million
for the current quarter, compared to
$749.1 million
for the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$96.2 million
, or
12.8%
. The increase in third party revenues was principally due to sales of new products which totaled approximately
$240 million
in the current quarter. The most significant new product launched in the current quarter was Doxycycline Hyclate Delayed-release (DR) Tablets USP, 150 mg, the generic version of Mayne Pharma's Doryx 150 mg product which is marketed by Warner Chilcott. The increase in sales from new products was partially offset by lower sales of existing products, including those launched as "new products" in the prior year, principally as a result of lower pricing. The effect of foreign currency translation was insignificant within North America.
Third party net revenues from EMEA were
$326.6 million
for the current quarter, compared to
$378.7 million
for the comparable prior year period, representing
a decrease
of
$52.1 million
, or
13.7%
. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on sales for the current quarter, principally reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro. Translating current quarter third party net revenues from EMEA at prior year comparative period exchange rates would have resulted in a
decrease
in third party net revenues of approximately
$14 million
, or
3%
. This
decrease
was the result of competitive market conditions which resulted in unfavorable pricing in a number of European markets in which Mylan operates, primarily France and Germany. These decreases were offset by increases in Italy and Spain, where local currency revenues increased approximately
21%
and
14%
, respectively.
Third party net revenues from Asia Pacific were
$307.5 million
for the current quarter, compared to
$310.9 million
for the comparable prior year period,
a decrease
of
$3.4 million
, or
1.1%
. However, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on sales for the current quarter, principally reflecting the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Indian Rupee. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, third party net revenues would have actually
increase
d by approximately
$29 million
, or
9%
. This increase is primarily driven by an increase in local currency revenues at Mylan Laboratories Limited (formerly Matrix Laboratories Limited), Mylan's subsidiary in India, as a result of increased sales of antiretroviral finished dosage form generic products, which are used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. In addition, local currency revenues in Japan were favorably impacted by higher volumes. Offsetting these increases was a slight decline in local currency revenues in Australia, as a result of significant government-imposed pricing reform which went into effect in the first quarter of 2012.
For the current quarter, Mylan's Specialty segment reported third party net sales of
$198.6 million
,
an increase
of
$66.9 million
, or
50.8%
, from the comparable prior year period of
$131.7 million
. The most significant contributor to Specialty segment revenues continues to be the EPIPEN auto-injector, sales of which increased as a result of favorable pricing and growth in the overall market. The EPIPEN auto-injector is the number one epinephrine auto-injector for the treatment of severe allergic reactions.
Gross profit for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
, was
$699.2 million
and gross margins were
41.3%
. For the
three months ended
June 30, 2011
, gross profit was
$669.4 million
, and gross margins were
42.5%
. Adjusted gross profit, as further defined below, for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$819.2 million
and adjusted gross
2
margins were
49%
as compared to adjusted gross profit of
$758.7 million
and adjusted gross margins of
48%
in the comparable prior year period. The increase in adjusted gross margins was primarily the result of favorable volume and pricing on the EPIPEN auto-injector and new products, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable pricing in all regions of our generics segment.
Earnings from operations were
$257.8 million
for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$280.5 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted earnings from operations for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$398.1 million
as compared to adjusted earnings from operations of
$384.6 million
in the comparable prior year period. This increase was driven by higher gross profit in the current year, mainly as a result of the increase in revenues in the North American generics business and in the Specialty segment and gross margin expansion as discussed above, partially offset by increases in research and development costs ("R&D") and selling, general and administrative costs ("SG&A"). R&D increased due primarily to the expenses related to the development of the respiratory and biologics programs as well as the timing of internal and external product development projects. SG&A increased as a result of increased marketing costs related to the
EPIPEN auto-injector
, and higher employee benefit costs.
Interest expense for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
, totaled
$75.7 million
, compared to
$84.7 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted interest expense for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$61.1 million
as compared to adjusted interest expense of
$72.3 million
in the comparable prior year period. The decrease was the result of lower interest expense on variable rate debt instruments primarily due to the refinancing of our credit agreement in November 2011.
 
Other income, net, was
$7.8 million
in the current quarter compared to
$7.2 million
in the comparable prior year period. Generally included in other income, net, are foreign exchange gains and losses and interest and dividend income.
Net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc.
decreased
$7.9 million
, or
5.4%
, to
$138.6 million
for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
as compared to
$146.4 million
for the prior year comparable period. Adjusted earnings
increased
$22.3 million
or
9.6%
to
$253.9 million
for the
three months ended
June 30, 2012
as compared to adjusted earnings of
$231.6 million
for the prior year comparable period.
EBITDA, which is defined as net income (excluding the non-controlling interest and income from equity method investees) plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, was
$390.8 million
for the quarter ended
June 30, 2012
, and
$412.9 million
for the comparable prior year period. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed below, adjusted EBITDA was
$447.6 million
for the current three-month period and
$437.4 million
for the comparable prior year period.
For the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, Mylan reported total revenues of
$3.28 billion
compared to
$3.02 billion
in the comparable prior year period. Third party net revenues for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
were
$3.25 billion
compared to
$3.01 billion
for the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$244.2 million
, or
8.1%
. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, generally reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies in other major markets in which Mylan operates. Translating third party net revenues at prior year exchange rates would have resulted in year-over-year growth in third party net revenues, excluding foreign currency of
$342 million
, or approximately
11%
.
Generics third party net revenues were
$2.89 billion
for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$2.78 billion
in the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$112.1 million
, or
4.0%
, or an increase of approximately
8%
when excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.
Third party net revenues from North America were
$1.62 billion
for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$1.42 billion
for the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$198.5 million
, or
13.9%
. The increase in third party revenues was principally due to sales of new products which totaled approximately
$430 million
in the current year to date period, partially offset by lower revenues from existing products.
Third party net revenues from EMEA were
$662.3 million
for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$767.8 million
for the comparable prior year period,
a decrease
of
$105.5 million
, or
13.7%
. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, the
decrease
was approximately
$53 million
, or
7%
. This
decrease
was the result of competitive market conditions resulting in lower volume and pricing in a number of European markets in which Mylan operates, primarily France and Germany, offset by a strong
3
performance in Italy.
In Asia Pacific, third party net revenues were
$606.1 million
for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$587.0 million
for the comparable prior year period,
an increase
of
$19.2 million
, or
3.3%
. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, the
increase
was approximately
$61 million
, or
10%
.This
increase
is primarily driven by higher third party sales at Mylan Laboratories Limited.
Specialty reported third party net revenues of
$360.8 million
for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
,
an increase
of
$132.1 million
, or
57.7%
over the comparable prior year period amount of
$228.7 million
. This increase was the result of higher sales of the EPIPEN auto-injector.
Gross profit for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$1.37 billion
and gross margins were
41.6%
. For the comparable prior year period, gross profit was
$1.26 billion
and gross margins were
41.7%
. Adjusted gross profit for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$1.58 billion
and adjusted gross margins were
48%
as compared to adjusted gross profit of
$1.44 billion
and adjusted gross margins of
48%
in the comparable prior year period.
Earnings from operations were
$504.2 million
for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$492.1 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted earnings from operations for the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$766.4 million
as compared to adjusted earnings from operations of
$724.1 million
in the comparable prior year period. This increase was driven by higher gross profit in the current year, mainly as a result of the increase in revenues in the North American generics business and in the Specialty segment, partially offset by increases in R&D and SG&A. R&D increased due primarily to the expenses related to the development of the respiratory and biologics programs as well as the timing of internal and external product development projects. SG&A increased as a result of increased marketing and employee benefit costs, including increased costs for retirement and post-employment programs.
Interest expense for the
six months ended

, totaled
$158.1 million
, compared to
$169.1 million

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Mylan is disclosing non-GAAP financial measures when providing financial results. Primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures
4
prepared only in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). In addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, Mylan is disclosing certain non-GAAP results that exclude items such as amortization expense and other costs directly associated with the acquisitions as well as certain other expense, revenue and operating cash flow items in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the company's financial performance, because the company's management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. In addition, the company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA pursuant to our credit agreement is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants (which are calculated using a measure similar to adjusted EBITDA) and assess the company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. Whenever Mylan uses such a non-GAAP measure, it will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most closely applicable GAAP measure set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Below is a reconciliation of GAAP net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. and diluted GAAP EPS to adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. and adjusted diluted EPS for the
three and six months ended
