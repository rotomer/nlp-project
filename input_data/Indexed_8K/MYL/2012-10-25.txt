Mylan Reports a
51%
Increase
in
Third
Quarter
2012
Adjusted Diluted EPS to
$0.83
Raises 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $2.50 - $2.60
Expects full year adjusted operating cash flow to hit record of approximately $1 billion
PITTSBURGH - October 25, 2012-Mylan Inc. (Nasdaq: MYL) today announced its financial results for the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2012
.
Financial Highlights
Mylan Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch commented:
Mylan delivered another outstanding quarter of top- and bottom-line growth, with strong double-digit growth in our Specialty, North America, and Asia Pacific businesses and a return to growth in EMEA. It is notable that we delivered adjusted diluted EPS for this one quarter in excess of our earnings for all of 2008the first full year following our Matrix and Merck KGaA generics acquisitions
providing further evidence of our ability to generate optimal organic growth from our global scale and operating leverage.
As a result of this strong operational performance, we again are raising our earnings guidance for 2012 and now expect adjusted diluted EPS of $2.50 to $2.60. Looking to next year, we continue to remain confident in our 2013 adjusted diluted EPS target of $2.75, as well as our longer term target of $6.00 in adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. We look forward to providing detailed guidance for 2013 in conjunction with the announcement of our full year 2012 results. Our continued expected growth will come from a combination of continuing to maximize our existing global platform, executing against our strategic growth drivers, and leveraging our significant financial flexibility to enhance shareholder value.
John Sheehan, Mylan's Chief Financial Officer, added:
The third quarter was the best in Mylan
'
s history in terms of operating cash flow and we continue to invest this cash in the future growth drivers of our business by fueling R&D and investing in capital expenditures. As a result of our strong performance so far this year, we now anticipate 2012 adjusted operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which is at the very upper end of our previous expectations, and now expect 2012 adjusted free cash flow of approximately $700 million.
Financial Results Summary
For the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
, Mylan reported total revenues of
$1.81 billion
compared to
$1.58 billion
in the comparable prior year period,
an increase
of
$234.0 million
or
14.8%
. The effect of foreign currency translation had
an unfavorable
impact of approximately
5%
on total revenues primarily reflecting a stronger U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of the other major markets in which Mylan operates. Translating total revenues for the current quarter at prior year comparative period exchange rates would have resulted in
year-over-year growth
of approximately
$308 million
, or
20%
.
A tabular summary of Mylan's revenues for the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2012
and
2011
is included at the end of this release. Also included at the end of this release are the reconciliations of adjusted financial results to the most closely applicable GAAP financial result.
Third party net revenues from Mylan's Generics segment, which are derived from sales in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA) and Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand (collectively, Asia Pacific) were
$1.50 billion
in the quarter ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$1.36 billion
in the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$137.4 million
, or
10.1%
, or
an increase
of approximately
16%
when excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.
Third party net revenues from North America were
$831.0 million
for the current quarter, compared to
$697.0 million
for the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$134.0 million
, or
19.2%
. The
increase
in third party net revenues was principally due to sales of new products which totaled approximately
$258 million
in the current quarter. The most significant new product launched in the current quarter was Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets USP. This product is the generic version of Novartis' Diovan HCT Tablets, which are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. The increase in sales from new products was partially offset by lower sales of existing products, including those launched as "new products" in the prior year, principally as a result of lower pricing. The effect of foreign currency translation was insignificant within North America.
Third party net revenues from EMEA were
$325.6 million
for the current quarter, compared to
$350.9 million
for the comparable prior year period, representing
a decrease
of
$25.3 million
, or
7.2%
. Foreign currency translation had a
negative
impact on sales for the current quarter, principally reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro. Translating current quarter third party net revenues from EMEA at prior year comparative period exchange rates would have resulted in an
increase
in third party net revenues of approximately
$12 million
, or
3%
. This
increase
was principally the result of an increase in revenues in France and Italy of approximately
9%
and
17%
, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable pricing in a number of European markets in which Mylan operates as a result of government imposed pricing reductions and competitive market conditions.
Third party net revenues from Asia Pacific were
$339.2 million
for the current quarter, compared to
$310.6 million
for the comparable prior year period,
an increase
of
$28.6 million
, or
9.2%
. However, foreign currency translation had a
negative
impact on sales for the current quarter, principally reflecting the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Indian Rupee. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, third party net revenues would have
increased
by approximately
$64 million
, or
21%
. This
increase
is primarily driven by higher revenues at Mylan Laboratories Limited (formerly Matrix Laboratories Limited), Mylan's subsidiary in India, as a result of increased sales of antiretroviral finished dosage form generic products, which are used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, and an increase in sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). In addition, local currency revenues in Japan were favorably impacted by higher volumes. Offsetting these increases was a decline in local currency revenues in Australia, principally as a result of significant government-imposed price cuts in the current year.
For the current quarter, Mylan's Specialty segment reported third party net sales of
$294.1 million
,
an increase
of
$80.1 million
, or
37.4%
, from the comparable prior year period of
$213.9 million
. The most significant contributor to Specialty segment revenues continues to be the
EPIPEN auto-injector
, sales of which increased as a result of favorable pricing and volume, including growth in the overall market. The
EPIPEN auto-injector
is the number one epinephrine auto-injector for the treatment of severe allergic reactions.
Gross profit for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
, was
$788.5 million
and gross margins were
43.6%
. For the
three months ended
September 30, 2011
, gross profit was
$658.4 million
, and gross margins were
41.8%
. Adjusted gross profit, as further defined below, for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
was
$940.6 million
2
and adjusted gross margins were
52%
as compared to adjusted gross profit of
$763.9 million
and adjusted gross margins of
48%
in the comparable prior year period. The
increase
in adjusted gross margins was primarily the result of new product introductions in North America and the increase in sales of the
EPIPEN auto-injector
, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable pricing on existing products in all regions within our Generics segment.
Earnings from operations were
$329.9 million
for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$265.9 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted earnings from operations for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
was
$512.7 million
as compared to adjusted earnings from operations of
$387.6 million
in the comparable prior year period. This
increase
was driven by higher gross profit in the current year, as discussed above, partially offset by increases in research and development costs ("R&D") and selling, general and administrative costs ("SG&A"). R&D increased due primarily to the expenses related to the development of the respiratory and biologics programs as well as the timing of internal and external product development projects. SG&A increased as a result of increased marketing costs in our Specialty segment, and higher employee benefit costs.
Interest expense for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
, totaled
$76.1 million
, compared to
$85.8 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted interest expense for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
was
$61.2 million
as compared to adjusted interest expense of
$73.2 million
in the comparable prior year period. The
decrease
was the result of lower interest expense on variable rate debt instruments primarily due to the refinancing of our credit agreement in November 2011.
 
Other income, net
, was
$10.9 million
in the current quarter compared to
$12.1 million
in the comparable prior year period. Generally included in
other income, net
, are foreign exchange gains and losses and interest and dividend income.
Net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc.
increased
$54.6 million
, or
34.8%
, to
$211.3 million
for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
as compared to
$156.7 million
for the prior year comparable period. Adjusted earnings
increased
$103.5 million
or
43.5%
to
$341.3 million
for the
three months ended
September 30, 2012
as compared to adjusted earnings of
$237.8 million
for the prior year comparable period.
EBITDA, which is defined as net income (excluding the non-controlling interest and income from equity method investees) plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, was
$514.1 million
for the quarter ended
September 30, 2012
, and
$419.6 million
for the comparable prior year period. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed below, adjusted EBITDA was
$567.0 million
for the current three-month period and
$446.8 million
for the comparable prior year period.
For the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, Mylan reported total revenues of
$5.09 billion
compared to
$4.60 billion
in the comparable prior year period. Third party net revenues for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
were
$5.04 billion
compared to
$4.58 billion
for the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$461.7 million
, or
10.1%
. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, generally reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies in other major markets in which Mylan operates. Translating third party net revenues at prior year exchange rates would have resulted in
year-over-year growth
in third party net revenues, excluding foreign currency, of
$633 million
, or approximately
14%
.
Generics third party net revenues were
$4.39 billion
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$4.14 billion
in the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$249.5 million
, or
6.0%
, or an increase of approximately
10%
when excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.
Third party net revenues from North America were
$2.45 billion
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$2.12 billion
for the comparable prior year period, representing
an increase
of
$332.5 million
, or
15.7%
. The
increase
in third party revenues was principally due to sales of new products which totaled approximately
$685 million
in the current year to date period, partially offset by lower revenues from existing products.
Third party net revenues from EMEA were
$987.9 million
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$1.12 billion
for the comparable prior year period,
a decrease
of
$130.8 million
, or
11.7%
. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, the
decrease
was approximately
$41 million
, or
4%
. This
decrease
was the result of unfavorable pricing, due to government imposed reductions and competitive market conditions in a number of European markets in which Mylan operates, partially offset by new
3
product introductions throughout Europe and favorable volume in France, Italy and Spain.
In Asia Pacific, third party net revenues were
$945.4 million
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$897.6 million
for the comparable prior year period,
an increase
of
$47.8 million
, or
5.3%
. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency, calculated as described above, the
increase
was approximately
$125 million
, or
14%
.This
increase
is primarily driven by higher third party sales at Mylan Laboratories Limited.
Specialty reported third party net revenues of
$654.8 million
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
,
an increase
of
$212.2 million
, or
47.9%
over the comparable prior year period amount of
$442.7 million
. This increase was the result of higher sales of the
EPIPEN auto-injector
.
Gross profit for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
was
$2.15 billion
and gross margins were
42.3%

$1.92 billion
and gross margins were
41.7%
. Adjusted gross profit for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
was
$2.52 billion
and adjusted gross margins were
50%
as compared to adjusted gross profit of
$2.20 billion
and adjusted gross margins of
48%
in the comparable prior year period.
Earnings from operations were
$834.1 million
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$758.1 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted earnings from operations for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
were
$1.28 billion
as compared to adjusted earnings from operations of
$1.11 billion
in the comparable prior year period. This increase was driven by higher gross profit in the current year, as discussed above, partially offset by increases in R&D and SG&A. R&D increased due primarily to the expenses related to the development of the respiratory and biologics programs as well as the timing of internal and external product development projects. SG&A increased as a result of increased marketing and employee benefit costs, including increased costs for retirement and post-employment programs.
Interest expense for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, totaled
$234.1 million
, compared to
$254.8 million
for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted interest expense for the

as compared to adjusted earnings of

, and

$818 million
for the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$627 million

$652 million
for the
nine months ended

, compared to
$426 million
for the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures were approximately
$160 million
in the current year as compared to approximately
$168 million
in the same prior year period.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Mylan is disclosing non-GAAP financial measures when providing financial results. Primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). In addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, Mylan is disclosing certain non-GAAP results that exclude items such as amortization expense and other costs directly associated with the acquisitions as well as certain other expense, revenue and operating cash flow items in order to supplement investors' and other readers'
4
understanding and assessment of the company's financial performance, because the company's management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. In addition, the company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA pursuant to our credit agreement is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants (which are calculated using a measure similar to adjusted EBITDA) and assess the company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. Whenever Mylan uses such a non-GAAP measure, it will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most closely applicable GAAP measure set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Below is a reconciliation of GAAP net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. and diluted GAAP EPS to adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. and adjusted diluted EPS for the
