Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Mylan Inc. (the Company) entered into an indenture, dated as of December 21, 2012 (the Indenture), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, which governs the terms of the Company's $750 million 3.125% Senior Notes due 2023 (the Notes).
The Notes were issued in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A and to persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per annum, accruing from December 21, 2012. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2013. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2023, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes prior to maturity at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes being redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed, not including unpaid interest accrued to, but excluding, the redemption date, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the treasury rate plus an applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus, in each case, unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed accrued to the redemption date. If the Company experiences certain change of control events, it must offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, create liens and consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of the Company's assets.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes to repay amounts borrowed under its revolving facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, including borrowings used to fund the Company's repurchase of up to $500 million of its common stock in the open market and through other methods, as the Company announced on November 20, 2012. The Company expects to use any incremental proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms of the Indenture, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, and the Notes, the form of which is contained in Exhibit 4.1, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information included in Item 1.01 with respect to the Notes is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission

If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) hereof with respect to the Company) shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of the Notes, may declare to be immediately due and payable the principal amount of all such Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest
-35-
to the date of acceleration. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) hereof with respect to the Company shall occur, such amount with respect to all the Notes shall become automatically due and payable immediately without any further action or notice. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained by the applicable person, the registered Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes then outstanding may cancel such acceleration if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, that has become due solely because of the acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Subject to Section 7.01 hereof, in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture and may take any necessary action requested of it as Trustee to settle, compromise, adjust or otherwise conclude any proceedings to which it is a party.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. Any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee may be brought in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements of the Trustee and its counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative, to the extent permitted by law. Any costs associated with actions taken by the Trustee under this Section 6.03 shall be reimbursed to the Trustee by the Company.
Section 6.04.
    
Waiver of Past Defaults and Events of Default

In the case of any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes will be restored to their former positions and rights under this Indenture, respectively;
provided
that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Control by Majority

However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that may involve the Trustee in personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Holders of the affected Notes not joining in the giving of such direction and may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes.
Section 6.06.
    
Limitation on Suits
.

(e)
    
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.06 to compensate and indemnify the Trustee, Agents and each predecessor Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee, Agents and each predecessor Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall be the liability of the Company and the lien provided for under this Section 7.06 and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction, discharge or other termination of this Indenture for any reason, including any termination or rejection hereof under any Bankruptcy Law.
(f)
    
In addition to, but without prejudice to its other rights under this Indenture, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(8) or Section 6.01(9) hereof occurs, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
(g)

provided

however
, that the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Trustee hereunder shall not affect the rights or any other Trustee hereunder.

secure the Notes;
(8)
    
provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Indenture;

conform the text of this Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees to any provision of the Description of Notes contained in the Offering Memorandum; and
(11)
    
allow any Subsidiary Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Notes.
Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a board resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.05 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture, in which case the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
Section 8.02.
    
With Consent of Holders
.
(c)
    
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may modify or amend this Indenture as it applies to the Notes with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes affected by the modification (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes), and any past default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture relating to the Notes may also be waived (except a default in the payment of principal, premium or interest and a default under clause (b) of this Section 8.02) with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.
(d)
    
However, no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of each Holder of Notes affected thereby:
-45-
(6)
    
change the due date of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, the Notes;
(7)
    
reduce the principal amount of, or any premium or interest rate on, the Notes;
(8)
    
change the place or currency of payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, the Notes;
(9)
    
reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Note;
(10)
    
release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee or this Indenture otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this Indenture;
(11)
    
impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Notes after the due date thereof; or
(12)
    
reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, the consent of whose Holders is required for modification or amendment of this Indenture, for waiver of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or for waiver of certain defaults.
(e)
    
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of then outstanding Notes may waive future compliance by the Company with certain restrictive covenants of this Indenture. The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes may waive any past default under this Indenture, except a failure by the Company to pay the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Notes or a provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holders of all outstanding Notes.
(f)
    
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, notice, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, or by any Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in conclusively relying on any such direction, notice, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned will be so disregarded.
(g)
    
It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
After an amendment that requires the consent of the Holders of the affected Notes becomes effective, the Company shall mail to each registered Holder of the affected Notes at such Holders address appearing in the security register a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders of such Notes, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.
Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a board resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the receipt by the Trustee of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.05, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture, in which case the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
-46-
Section 8.03.
    
Revocation and Effect of Consents
.
After an amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent conclusive and binding upon such Holder and every subsequent Holder of the same Note or portion thereof, and of any Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in place thereof, even if notation of the consent is not made on any such Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement, or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then, notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement, or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless the consent of the requisite number of Holders has been obtained.
Section 8.04.
    
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
.
If an amendment, supplement, or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee (in accordance with the specific written direction of the Company) shall request the Holder of the Note (in accordance with the specific written direction of the Company) to deliver it to the Trustee. In such case, the Trustee shall place an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
Section 8.05.
    
Trustee To Sign Amendments
,
etc
.
The Trustee shall sign any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article VIII if the amendment, supplement or waiver does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee, the Trustee may, but need not, sign such amendment, supplement or waiver. In signing or refusing to sign such amendment, supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 7.01 hereof, shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating, in addition to the matters required by Section 11.02 hereof, that such amendment, supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

either:
-47-
(F)

have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable, or may be called for redemption, within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption pursuant to the provisions described under Section 3.07(a) hereof and, in any case, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of such Notes, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the Company, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness (including all principal and accrued interest) on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
(2)
    
in respect of clause (a)(1)(B) of this Section 9.01, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness) or the granting of Liens in connection therewith) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is bound (other than with respect to the borrowing of funds to be applied concurrently to make the deposit required to effect such satisfaction and discharge (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness) or the granting of Liens in connection therewith),

Legal Defeasance
). Legal Defeasance means that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Notes and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, and this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding Notes and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, except as to:
(1)
    
the rights of Holders of the Notes issued under this Indenture to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to this Indenture;
-48-
(2)

Covenant Defeasance
) on and after the conditions in Section 9.02 hereof with respect to Covenant Defeasance are satisfied, and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to such Notes. The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.
(j)
    
If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto.
(k)
    
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
(l)
    
Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 9.01, the Companys obligations in Sections 2.04, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.06, 9.05 and 9.06 shall survive with respect to the Notes until such time as the Notes have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Companys obligations in Sections 7.06, 9.05 and 9.06 shall survive.
Section 9.02.
    
Conditions to Defeasance
.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:
i.    the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, as trust funds, in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the Company, to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes on the stated date for payment or on the Redemption Date of the principal or installment of principal of or interest on such Notes;
i.    in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions:
1.    the Company has received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling; or
-49-
1.    since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law;
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon this Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(a)
    
in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States who is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(b)
    
no Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to make such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness) or the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;
(c)
    
such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a Default under this Indenture or a default under any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound (other than any such Default or default resulting solely from the borrowing of funds and the grant of any related liens to be applied to such deposit);
(d)
    
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by it with the intent of preferring the Holders over any other of its creditors or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or others; and
(e)
    
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel in the United States (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance; as the case may be, have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02, the conditions set forth in the foregoing subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) need not be satisfied so long as, at the time the Company makes the deposit described in subsection (a), (i) no Default under clauses (1), (2), (8) and (9)  under Section 6.01 hereof has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit and after giving effect thereto, and (ii) either (x) a notice of redemption has been mailed providing for redemption of all the Notes not more than 60 days after such mailing and the requirements for such redemption shall have been complied with or (y) the Stated Maturity of the Notes will occur within 60 days. If the conditions in the preceding sentence are satisfied, the Company shall be deemed to have exercised its Covenant Defeasance option.
If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes, as the case may be, when due, then the Companys obligations and the obligations of Subsidiary Guarantors under this Indenture will be revived and no such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.

provided
that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or accrued interest on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

Each Subsidiary Guarantor, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the Notes and obligations of the Company hereunder and thereunder, and guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and to the Trustee on behalf of such Holder, that (i) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise (including, without limitation, the amount that would become due but for the operation of any automatic stay provision of any Bankruptcy Law), together with interest on the overdue principal, if any, and interest on any overdue interest, to the extent lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or of any such other obligations, the same will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, subject, however, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the limitations set forth in Section 10.03 hereof.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Subsidiary Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Subsidiary Guarantor.
(g)
    
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other Person, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be discharged as to the Notes, except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Note, this Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges that the Subsidiary Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest on such Note, whether at its Stated Maturity, by acceleration, purchase or otherwise, legal
-52-
proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Note, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Indenture, directly against each of the Subsidiary Guarantors to enforce such Subsidiary Guarantors Subsidiary Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders are prevented by applicable law from exercising their respective rights to accelerate the maturity of the Notes, to collect interest on the Notes, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Notes, such Subsidiary Guarantor will pay to the Trustee for the account of the Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of the Holders.
(h)
    
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any amount paid by any of them to the Trustee or such Holder, the Subsidiary Guarantee of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between each Subsidiary Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) subject to this Article X, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI hereof for the purposes of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VI hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
(i)
    
Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Companys assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes are, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Notes, whether as a voidable preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Notes shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
(j)
    
To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that a Notation of Guarantee substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit G
hereto will be endorsed by an Officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered to the Trustee and that this Indenture or a supplemental indenture to this Indenture will be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by one of its Officers. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a Notation of Guarantee. The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will be deemed to constitute due delivery of the Notation of Guarantee set forth in this Indenture by the Subsidiary Guarantors. If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Notation of Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Notation of Guarantee is endorsed, the Notation of Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and each such Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount that will not, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee or pursuant to this Article X, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

(1)    100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes being redeemed, and
(2)    the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed, not including unpaid interest accrued to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points with respect to any Notes, plus, in each case, unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed accrued to the Redemption Date.

6.    
Redemption Procedures
. If the Company redeems less than all of the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select Notes by lot on a
pro rata
basis (or, in the case of Global Notes, based on a method that most nearly approximates a
pro rata
selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. The Company will redeem Notes of $2,000 or less in whole and not in part. For all purposes of the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, provisions of the Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption.
7.    
Notice of Redemption
. Notices of redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address.

10.    
Unclaimed Money
. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its request or, if such money is then held by the Company in trust, such money shall be released from such trust. After that, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company for payment as general creditors unless applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.
11.    
Amendment, Supplement, Waiver, Etc
. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may modify or amend the Indenture without the consent of any Holder to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect, mistake or inconsistency in the Indenture and make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of the Holder. Other amendments and modifications of the Indenture or the Notes may be made by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, subject to certain exceptions requiring the consent of each of the Holders of the Notes to be affected.
12.    
Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event
. If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require that the Company purchase all or any part (in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holders Notes pursuant to a Change of Control offer (a 
Change of Control Offer

A-5
Holders of record on relevant record dates to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to such record date)
13.    
Successor Entity
. When a successor entity assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Notes and the Indenture and the transaction complies with the terms of Article V of the Indenture, the predecessor entity will, except as provided in Article V, be released from those obligations.
14.    
Defaults and Remedies
. Events of Default are set forth in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Notes (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) of the Indenture with respect to the Company) shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of the Notes may declare to be immediately due and payable the principal amount of all Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of acceleration. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) of the Indenture with respect to the Company shall occur, such amount with respect to all the Notes shall become automatically due and payable immediately without any further action or notice. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note (including payments pursuant to a redemption or repurchase of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
