EXHIBIT 99.1 (NOBLE ENERGY LOGO) NEWS RELEASE CONTACT: Greg Panagos: 281-872-3125 Investor_Relations@nobleenergyinc.com NOBLE ENERGY, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Company Reports Strongest Discretionary Cash Flow Since First Quarter 2001 HOUSTON (April 30, 2003) -- Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) today reported first quarter net income of $40.7 million, or 71 cents per share, before the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The company's reported first quarter 2003 earnings, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, compares to a net loss of $15.1 million, or 26 cents per share, for the same period last year. On January 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 143 and recorded a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $5.8 million as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle. Including the effects of SFAS No. 143, Noble Energy reported net income of $34.9 million, or 61 cents per share. Discretionary cash flow (see Determination of Discretionary Cash Flow and Reconciliation schedule) for the first quarter 2003 was $176.0 million compared to $91.3 million last year. The increase in net income and discretionary cash flow versus the first quarter last year primarily reflected higher realized commodity prices. The company's improved financial performance also resulted from the recent start-up of two significant international projects, production from the Cheng Dao Xi (CDX) field in the south Bohai Bay in China and electrical power production in Ecuador. As a result, Noble Energy experienced strong year-on-year improvements across all of its business units. Realized natural gas prices for the first quarter 2003 were $4.65 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), more than double last year's $2.31 per Mcf. Realized crude oil prices were $29.43 per barrel (Bbl), an increase of 48 percent compared to $19.83 per Bbl for the first quarter 2002. Realized methanol prices were 66 cents per gallon (Gal) for the first quarter 2003, an increase of 128 percent over 29 cents per Gal for the same period last year. Charles D. Davidson, the company's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "High commodity prices certainly had a strong positive impact on our first quarter financial performance, leading to our highest reported discretionary cash flow since the first quarter of 2001. More importantly, I'm quite pleased with the progress the company has made operationally. We have completed yet another successful international project with the start up of our Bohai Bay field in January. Meanwhile, our natural gas project in Israel and the expansion in Equatorial Guinea are on track for fourth quarter start-ups. Our domestic drilling and production programs are off to a strong start this year, resulting in growth in domestic production over the fourth quarter of 2002." Compared to the fourth quarter 2002, overall production volumes for the first quarter 2003 increased over four percent to 101,235 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) from 96,898 Boepd. Domestic operations had a production increase of one-half percent compared to the fourth quarter 2002. International volumes increased 14 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2002, primarily because of increased crude oil volumes resulting from the start-up of production in China. First quarter 2003 production volumes declined one percent to 101,235 Boepd from 102,416 Boepd for the same period last year. The decline in volumes was attributable to natural decline rates for
domestic natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast region, partially offset by increased international volumes from China, Ecuador and Equatorial Guinea. Oil and gas operating costs for the three months ending March 31, 2003 were $4.98 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) compared to $3.51 per BOE for the same period last year. The quarter-on-quarter increase in per BOE oil and gas operating costs was primarily due to lower production volumes, increased production taxes resulting from higher natural gas and crude oil prices and increased ad valorem taxes. Other miscellaneous cost increases also contributed to higher operating costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization also increased to $9.03 per BOE compared to $8.19 per BOE in the first quarter of 2002. The increase was primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, increased capitalized costs for the expansion projects in Equatorial Guinea and the initial capital carry associated with the company's joint venture with Aspect Energy. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS Domestic operations reported operating income for the first quarter of $51.0 million, including the $8.9 million pretax charge for the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143, compared to an operating loss of $13.8 million for the first quarter last year. Domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas during the quarter, which increased 44 percent and 117 percent, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2002. The average domestic realized crude oil price was $26.49 per Bbl compared to $18.37 per Bbl during the first quarter of 2002. The average domestic realized natural gas price was $5.35 per Mcf compared to $2.47 per Mcf last year. These increases were partially offset by a year-on-year decline in production volumes. Oil and gas operating expense increased $5.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2002, primarily because of increased production taxes associated with higher commodity prices and increased ad valorem taxes. Two large deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects commenced production during the first quarter. Green Canyon 136 #8 (Shasta), in which Noble Energy has a 25 percent working interest, began production in January and is currently producing 5.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMcfpd), net to Noble Energy. At Green Canyon 282 (Boris), in which Noble Energy has a 25 percent working interest, Boris #1 began producing February 3 and is currently producing 3,725 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) and 6.0 MMcfpd, net to Noble Energy. Boris #2 is expected to begin production by the middle of the third quarter 2003. Noble Energy expects that production from Boris #1 and Boris #2 will be flow line constrained at 4,500 Bopd and 7.0 MMcfpd, net to the company. In the traditional Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf, South Timbalier 169 #A-7 (100 percent to Noble Energy) was completed as a discovery well in March 2003. Net to Noble Energy, the well is currently producing at a rate of 8.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Noble Energy's domestic onshore operations were very active during the quarter, drilling 10 exploration and development wells with six successes. The company plans to drill a total of 75 onshore wells in 2003, of which 40 are scheduled for the Gulf Coast area and 35 are scheduled for the Mid-continent and Rocky Mountain areas. During the first three months of 2003, Noble Energy participated in 13 gross domestic exploration and development wells, of which eight, or 62 percent, were successful. Compared to the fourth quarter 2002, domestic production volumes increased to 67,727 Boepd from 67,378 Boepd. The increase in production volumes was due to the start-up of Boris #1 and Shasta. 2
Domestic production volumes declined to 67,727 Boepd in the first quarter of 2003 from 76,527 Boepd last year. The decline in production volumes was primarily due to natural decline rates in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast region. In January, Noble Energy announced that the company had begun a process of reviewing and rationalizing its asset portfolio in order to focus on high-quality, core properties with significant upside potential. Subject to board approval, any sales that may occur are expected to be completed by year-end. Current production from the properties considered for sale ranges from 4,000 to 4,500 Bopd and from 26 to 30 MMcfpd, net to Noble Energy. Approximately 70 percent of reserves associated with the properties are crude oil. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS International operations reported record operating income for the first quarter of $36.3 million compared to operating income of $10.7 million in the first quarter last year. First quarter 2003 results reflected a year-on-year increase in production volumes, higher realized commodity prices, income from the Machala power plant in Ecuador and start-up of production in China. International operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil during the quarter, which increased 50 percent compared to the first quarter of 2002. The average international realized crude oil price was $32.26 per Bbl compared to $21.44 per Bbl during the first quarter of 2002. The average international realized natural gas price, excluding Ecuador, decreased eight percent to $1.18 per Mcf, compared to $1.28 per Mcf last year. First quarter 2003 international production volumes increased 29 percent to 33,508 Boepd from 25,889 Boepd last year. The increase in production volumes was primarily due to the start-up of crude oil production in China and natural gas production in Ecuador. Additional natural gas and condensate production in Equatorial Guinea also contributed to increased volumes. Equatorial Guinea Total operating income in Equatorial Guinea, which includes results from field operations and methanol, for the first quarter of 2003 was $24.0 million compared to $6.5 million last year. Operating income from Equatorial Guinea was the country's highest since methanol operations began in May 2001. Liquid petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and condensate sales accounted for $11.3 million, or 47 percent, of operating income from Equatorial Guinea. First quarter 2003 production volumes averaged 13,496 Boepd, a 19 percent increase over last year. The average realized price for liquids during the first quarter was $30.01 per Bbl compared to $20.99 per Bbl for the same period last year. Natural gas was sold to the Atlantic Methanol Production Company (AMPCO) at a price of 25 cents per Mcf. AMPCO, an unconsolidated subsidiary in which the company owns a 45 percent interest, produced $12.7 million of operating income net to Noble Energy's interest. AMPCO results are reported as income from unconsolidated subsidiaries. First quarter realized methanol prices averaged 66 cents per Gal compared to 29 cents per Gal last year. The company's share of AMPCO methanol sales volumes was 34.5 million Gal, an increase of 12 percent compared to 30.9 million Gal for the first quarter of 2002. North Sea In the North Sea, operating income for the first quarter of 2003 doubled to $15.4 million compared to $7.6 million last year. The quarter-on-quarter improvement reflects higher commodity prices and lower exploration expense, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization. 3
North Sea production for the first quarter of 2003 was 10,189 Boepd compared to 11,398 Boepd last year, reflecting natural field decline. Other International Other international includes operating results from Argentina, China, Ecuador, Israel and Vietnam. Noble Energy's Machala power plant contributed $5.7 million of operating income during the first quarter 2003. During the quarter, 223,206 megawatts (MW) were produced at an average sales price of 8.7 cents per kilowatt hour (Kwh). For the first quarter 2003, Noble Energy produced 25.7 MMcfpd of natural gas from the Amistad field at an average price of $3.97 per Mcf. During the first four months of 2003, both of the plant's transformers failed while under warranty. Both transformers have been replaced. In south Bohai Bay offshore China, production commenced from the CDX field on January 13, 2003. Initial production, net to Noble Energy, was 3,400 Bopd from three wells. Production is currently 4,100 Bopd, net to Noble Energy. The company expects production volumes to continue to increase gradually as wells and facility operations are optimized. Noble Energy has a 57 percent working interest in this project. During the first quarter 2003, the company recorded a $10.3 million pretax exploration charge for the Huizhou 9-2-1 well in the Pearl River Mouth Basin of the South China Sea. Huizhou 9-2-1 was a crude oil discovery made in 2001; however, follow up wells did not result in sufficient hydrocarbons to merit commercial development. Noble Energy is one of the nation's leading independent energy companies and operates throughout major basins in the United States including the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally, in Argentina, China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea and Vietnam.
