EXHIBIT 99.1 [NOBLE ENERGY LOGO APPEARS HERE] NEWS RELEASE CONTACT: Greg Panagos: 281-872-3125 Investor_Relations@nobleenergyinc.com CORRECTED FOR SECOND QUARTER 2003 DOMESTIC PRICES ------------------------------------------------- NOBLE ENERGY, INC. ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Net Income and Discretionary Cash Flow Increase 70 Percent and 26 Percent, Respectively HOUSTON (July 23, 2003) -- Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) today reported second quarter net income increased 70 percent to $29.1 million, or 51 cents per share, compared to net income of $17.1 million, or 30 cents per share, for the same period last year. Discretionary cash flow (see Determination of Discretionary Cash Flow and Reconciliation schedule) for the second quarter 2003 increased 26 percent to $152.3 million compared to $121.0 million last year. Discontinued operations reported a net loss of $2.0 million, which included a non-cash, after-tax charge of $3.2 million to write down the assets held for sale to their estimated fair value. Excluding the effect of the non-cash write down of assets held for sale, net income would have been $32.3 million, or 56 cents per share. Noble Energy has five property packages identified for disposition. During the second quarter, certain properties in two of these packages were classified as held for sale, written down to fair value and reported in discontinued operations (see Discontinued Operations Summary schedule). Following disposition of these two packages, a net gain on sale will be recognized in the third quarter. The book value of certain properties in the remaining packages may be adjusted in future quarters. The increase in reported net income and discretionary cash flow versus the second quarter last year primarily reflected higher realized commodity prices. The company's improved financial performance also resulted from the recent start-up of two significant international projects, production from the Cheng Dao Xi (CDX) field in south Bohai Bay in China and production from the company's offshore Amistad natural gas field and associated electrical power production in Ecuador. As a result, Noble Energy experienced strong year-on-year financial and operating improvements. Realized natural gas prices for the second quarter 2003 were $4.11 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), 34 percent above last year's $3.07 per Mcf. Realized crude oil prices were $25.84 per barrel (Bbl), an increase of six percent compared to $24.40 per Bbl for the second quarter 2002. Realized methanol prices were 72 cents per gallon (Gal) for the second quarter 2003, an increase of 85 percent over 39 cents per Gal for the same period last year. Charles D. Davidson, the company's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "The company continues to generate improved operating and financial results. Our domestic drilling and production programs maintained the momentum begun in the first quarter, as reflected in our strong quarter-to-quarter production growth. Likewise, international operations continued to show strong results, while our natural gas project in Israel and expansion in Equatorial Guinea rapidly approach start-up later this year. In addition, the company's solid first half earnings and cash flow have led to a continual strengthening of our balance sheet." Reported production, net of adjustments for discontinued operations, increased over two percent compared to the first quarter 2003, to 101,055 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) from 98,859 Boepd. Reported domestic operations had a quarter-to-quarter production increase of six percent compared to the first quarter 2003, with increased production of both natural gas and oil. International volumes decreased four percent compared to the first quarter 2003, primarily reflecting a seasonal reduction in electricity dispatch and consequent reduction in natural gas volumes in Ecuador, as well as lower North Sea natural gas volumes. Partially offsetting lower volumes in Ecuador and the North Sea was an increase in crude oil volumes in the
Bohai Bay in China. Overall production volumes for the second quarter, adding back the production associated with discontinued operations, were 103,466 Boepd. Second quarter 2003 reported production volumes increased seven percent to 101,055 Boepd from 94,051 Boepd for the same period last year. The increase in volumes was attributable to the start-up of production in China and Ecuador, as well as a substantial increase in production volumes in Equatorial Guinea, partially offset by lower domestic volumes. Reported oil and gas operating costs for the three months ending June 30, 2003 were $4.50 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) compared to $3.18 per BOE for the same period last year. The quarter-on-quarter increase in per BOE oil and gas operating costs was primarily due to increased production taxes resulting from higher natural gas and crude oil prices and increased ad valorem taxes. The start-up of new international properties and their associated costs also contributed to higher operating costs. Reported depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $8.59 per BOE, compared to $8.19 per BOE in the second quarter of 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher finding costs in the Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf in prior years and the initial capital carry associated with the company's joint venture with Aspect Energy. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 as of January 1, 2003, which relates to accounting for abandonment costs, also contributed to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization. For the first six months of 2003, net income was $63.9 million, or $1.12 per share, compared to net income of $2.0 million, or four cents per share, last year. Discretionary cash flow for the first half of 2003 was $328.3 million compared to $212.3 million for the same period last year. The year-on-year increase in net income and discretionary cash flow resulted from higher commodity prices and increased production volumes. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS Domestic operations reported operating income after discontinued operations for the second quarter of $44.7 million, including a $4.9 million non-cash, pre-tax charge for the write down of assets held for sale to their estimated fair value, compared to operating income of $38.0 million for the second quarter last year. Domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas during the quarter, which increased ten percent and 58 percent, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2002. The average domestic realized crude oil price was $25.60 per Bbl compared to $23.85 per Bbl during the second quarter of 2002. The average domestic realized natural gas price was $4.73 per Mcf compared to $3.32 per Mcf last year. Compared to the first quarter 2003, domestic production volumes increased six percent to 69,033 Boepd from 65,351 Boepd. Onshore operations contributed to the volume increase with successful drilling results in early 2003 and timely pipeline hook-ups of these wells. With the start up of two large deepwater projects during the first quarter, Green Canyon 136 #8 (Shasta) and the Green Canyon 282 (Boris #1), Noble Energy's offshore operations also contributed to the quarter-to-quarter increase in volumes. Domestic production volumes declined to 69,033 Boepd in the second quarter of 2003 from 71,412 Boepd last year. The decline in production volumes was primarily due to natural decline rates in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast region. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Noble Energy announced a discovery on Green Canyon Block 199 (Lorien) in July. The Lorien well, in which Noble Energy has a 20 percent working interest, encountered over 120 feet of apparent oil in a high-quality reservoir interval. The company and its partners have temporarily suspended the well pending further appraisal of the hydrocarbon zone that has been encountered. 2
In May, Noble Energy announced a deep shelf discovery at Louisiana State Lease 340 #1 (Mound Point). The well was drilled and evaluated to a measured depth of 19,024 feet. Noble Energy and its partners are completing the Mound Point well, and production is expected to commence early in the fourth quarter of 2003. Noble Energy owns a 25 percent working interest in the well. In the traditional Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf, Vermillion 196 #A-2 (25 percent to Noble Energy) was completed as a discovery well in March 2003. Net to Noble Energy, the well is currently producing at a rate of 5 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Noble Energy's domestic onshore operations remained active during the first half of 2003, drilling 38 exploration and development wells with 21 successes. The company plans to drill a total of 72 onshore wells in 2003, of which 37 are scheduled for the Gulf Coast area and 35 are scheduled for the Mid-continent and Rocky Mountain areas. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS International operations reported operating income for the second quarter of $22.5 million compared to operating income of $14.9 million in the second quarter last year. The quarter-on-quarter increase in international operations reflects an increase in liquids and natural gas production volumes, as well as methanol sales, in Equatorial Guinea. The start-up of production in China also contributed to improved quarter-on-quarter earnings, but was offset by a $10.4 million pre-tax exploration charge for the Hannah #1 well offshore Israel and the Joppa and Fleet wells in the North Sea. International operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil during the quarter, which increased four percent compared to the second quarter of 2002. The average international realized crude oil price was $26.08 per Bbl compared to $24.97 per Bbl during the second quarter of 2002. The average international realized natural gas price, excluding Ecuador, decreased 35 percent to $1.00 per Mcf, compared to $1.53 per Mcf last year. The decrease in realized natural gas prices primarily resulted from a 153 percent quarter-on-quarter increase in natural gas sales in Equatorial Guinea at a sales price of 25 cents per MMBTU. Second quarter 2003 international production volumes increased 41 percent to 32,022 Boepd from 22,639 Boepd last year. The increase in production volumes was primarily due to the start-up of crude oil production in China and natural gas production in Ecuador. Additional natural gas and condensate production in Equatorial Guinea also contributed to increased volumes. Equatorial Guinea Total operating income in Equatorial Guinea, which includes results from field operations and methanol, for the second quarter of 2003 was $21.7 million compared to $3.6 million last year. Liquid petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and condensate sales accounted for $9.8 million, or 45 percent, of operating income from Equatorial Guinea. Second quarter 2003 production volumes averaged 13,607 Boepd, a 71 percent increase over last year, primarily because the methanol plant was shut down for repairs for 65 days during the second quarter of 2002. The average realized price for liquids during the second quarter was $25.28 per Bbl compared to $22.90 per Bbl for the same period last year. Natural gas was sold to the Atlantic Methanol Production Company (AMPCO) at a price of 25 cents per MMBTU. AMPCO, an unconsolidated subsidiary in which the company owns a 45 percent interest, produced $11.9 million of operating income net to Noble Energy's interest. AMPCO results are reported as income from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Second quarter realized methanol prices averaged 72 cents per Gal compared to 39 cents per Gal last year. The company's share of AMPCO methanol sales volumes more than doubled to 29.8 million Gal compared to 13.9 million Gal for the second quarter of 2002, primarily reflecting a full quarter of production versus last year's 65 day shutdown for repairs. 3
North Sea In the North Sea, operating income for the second quarter of 2003 was $2.6 million compared to $10.8 million last year. The quarter-on-quarter decline in operating income primarily reflects increased exploration expense resulting from the Joppa and Fleet exploration wells, which were determined to be non-commercial. North Sea production for the second quarter of 2003 was 9,677 Boepd compared to 11,286 Boepd last year, reflecting natural field decline. Noble Energy participated in a successful well in U.K. block 15/20a (Jura). Studies are underway to determine the optimum development scenarios. An appraisal well may be drilled in the future. Noble Energy has a 30 percent working interest in this well. Other International Other international includes operating results from Argentina, China, Ecuador, Israel and Vietnam. In south Bohai Bay offshore China, production commenced from the CDX field on January 13, 2003. Production for the second quarter 2003 averaged 3,600 barrels of oil per day, net to Noble Energy. The company expects production volumes to increase gradually as wells and facility operations are optimized. Noble Energy has a 57 percent working interest in this project. Noble Energy's Machala power plant reported an operating loss of $0.9 million during the second quarter 2003. During the quarter, 111,666 megawatts (MW) were produced at an average sales price of 8.3 cents per kilowatt hour (Kwh), compared to 223,206 MW produced at an average sales price of 8.7 cents during the first quarter. For the second quarter 2003, Noble Energy produced 12.7 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd) of natural gas from the Amistad field at an average price of $3.88 per Mcf. Second quarter 2003 natural gas volumes declined 51 percent compared to 25.7 MMcfpd for the first quarter. The quarter-to-quarter decline in MW produced and natural gas volumes was due to the onset of the rainy season in Ecuador, which resulted in increased reliance on hydroelectric power production, and scheduled maintenance on the Machala power facility. Noble Energy is one of the nation's leading independent energy companies and operates throughout major basins in the United States including the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally, in Argentina, China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea and Vietnam.
