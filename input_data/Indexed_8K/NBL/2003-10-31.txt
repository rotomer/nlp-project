EXHIBIT 99.1 [NOBLE ENERGY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE 100 GLENBOROUGH DRIVE CONTACT: Greg Panagos: 281-872-3125 SUITE 100 Investor_Relations@nobleenergyinc.com HOUSTON, TX 77067 NOBLE ENERGY, INC. ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Net Income and Discretionary Cash Flow Increase $36.3 Million and $38.0 Million, Respectively HOUSTON (October 29, 2003) -- Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) today reported third quarter net income of $35.1 million, or 62 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or two cents per share, for the same period last year. Discretionary cash flow (see Determination of Discretionary Cash Flow and Reconciliation schedule) for the third quarter 2003 increased 33 percent to $153.2 million compared to $115.2 million for the same period last year. Discontinued operations reported net income of $3.0 million. Net income from discontinued operations included two non-cash adjustments, an after-tax charge of $11.9 million to write down the assets held for sale to their estimated fair value and an after-tax gain on the disposition of assets during the third quarter of $6.4 million. Excluding the effect of the after-tax gain on disposition of assets and the write down of assets held for sale, Noble Energy's net income would have been $40.6 million, or 72 cents per share. The increase in reported net income and discretionary cash flow versus the third quarter last year primarily reflected higher realized commodity prices and lower exploration expense. Increased production also contributed to strong year-on-year financial and operating improvements. Realized natural gas prices for the third quarter 2003 were $4.10 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), 50 percent above last year's $2.73 per Mcf. Realized crude oil prices were $27.49 per barrel (Bbl), an increase of five percent compared to $26.19 per Bbl for the third quarter 2002. Realized methanol prices were 63 cents per gallon (Gal) for the third quarter 2003, an increase of 31 percent over 48 cents per Gal for the same period last year. Charles D. Davidson, the company's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "The continuing strong commodity price environment has significantly enhanced our financial results. From an operating point of view, our international operations continued to show strong results, while our domestic drilling and production programs remained consistent with the first half of this year. Finally, after several years of substantial investment, I am pleased to be able to say our natural gas project in Israel and expansion in Equatorial Guinea are expected to begin operations this quarter." During 2003, Noble Energy identified five property packages for disposition, and bids have now been received on all five packages. During the third quarter, closed property sales resulted in a pre-tax gain of $9.9 million. Also during the third quarter, certain properties in two packages were classified as held for sale, written down by $18.3 million to fair value, pre-tax, and reported in discontinued operations (see Discontinued Operations Summary schedule). Subsequent to September 30, the remaining asset package met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. For the full year, property sales are expected to generate over $110 million in pre-tax proceeds. Reported production, net of adjustments for discontinued operations, was 90,236 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd), an increase of four percent compared to 86,807 Boepd for the same period last year. The increase in volumes was attributable to the start-up of production in China and a substantial increase in
production volumes in Ecuador, partially offset by lower domestic and North Sea volumes. As a result of property sales, overall production declined by approximately 950 Boepd relative to the second quarter. Third quarter 2003 reported production volumes declined compared to 94,275 Boepd for the second quarter of 2003. Increased natural gas volumes in Ecuador were offset by temporary maintenance related shut-ins in the North Sea, downtime for construction in Equatorial Guinea and minor curtailments in the U.S. Overall production for the third quarter 2003 was 99,111 Boepd after adding back the volumes associated with discontinued operations compared to 103,466 Boepd last quarter. Reported oil and gas operating costs from continuing operations for the three months ending September 30, 2003 were $4.52 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) compared to $3.92 per BOE for the same period last year. The quarter-on-quarter increase in per BOE oil and gas operating costs was primarily due to increased production taxes and ad valorem taxes resulting from higher natural gas and crude oil prices. Relatively high commodity prices are expected to continue for the remainder of 2003, which may cause aggregate oil and gas operating costs to exceed the company's original expectations for the year. The start-up of operations in China and the expansion in Equatorial Guinea and their associated costs also contributed to higher operating costs. Reported depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $8.81 per BOE, compared to $7.52 per BOE in the third quarter of 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher finding costs in the Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf in prior years and the initial capital carry associated with the company's joint venture with Aspect Energy. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 as of January 1, 2003, which relates to accounting for abandonment costs, also contributed to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $1.51 per BOE compared to $1.86 per BOE for the third quarter of 2002. The decrease primarily reflects lower legal expenses. For the first nine months of 2003, net income was $99.0 million, or $1.74 per share, compared to net income of $0.8 million, or one cent per share, last year. Discretionary cash flow for the first three quarters of 2003 was $481.6 million compared to $327.5 million for the same period last year. The year-on-year increase in net income and discretionary cash flow resulted from higher commodity prices and increased production volumes. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS Domestic operations reported operating income after discontinued operations for the third quarter of $41.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million for the same period last year. Domestic operating income included a non-cash charge of $8.4 million. The total non-cash charge included a write down of assets held for sale to fair value, partially offset by a realized gain on sale of assets. Domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas during the quarter, which increased four percent and 50 percent, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2002. The average domestic realized crude oil price was $26.55 per Bbl compared to $25.48 per Bbl during the third quarter of 2002. The average domestic realized natural gas price was $4.70 per Mcf compared to $3.14 per Mcf last year. Compared to the second quarter 2003, domestic production volumes, excluding discontinued operations, decreased to 59,301 Boepd from 62,253 Boepd. The production decline was primarily due to temporarily reduced volumes at Green Canyon 282 (Boris) and pipeline maintenance at Main Pass 305/306. Adding back production from discontinued operations, domestic production during the third quarter was 68,176 Boepd. During the quarter, domestic properties with production volumes by approximately 950 Boepd were sold. Domestic production volumes declined to 59,301 Boepd in the third quarter of 2003 from 61,073 Boepd last year. The decline in production volumes was primarily due to natural decline rates in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast region. 2
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Boris #2 began production during the third quarter. Gross production from the Boris #1 and #2 wells is currently curtailed at 16,500 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) and 26 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd). Noble Energy has a 25 percent working interest in Boris. In September, production began at South Timbalier 316 #A-1 (Roaring Fork) at an initial rate of 6,000 Bopd and 13.2 MMcfpd. Noble Energy owns a 40 percent working interest in Roaring Fork. Production began at Louisiana State Lease 340 #1 (Mound Point) in October at an initial rate of 33 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfepd). Noble Energy owns a 25 percent working interest in Mound Point. Noble Energy's domestic onshore operations were active during the first three quarters of 2003, drilling 50 exploration and development wells with 29 successes. The company plans to drill a total of 85 onshore wells in 2003, of which 49 are scheduled for the Gulf Coast area and 36 are scheduled for the Mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS International operations reported operating income for the third quarter of $29.4 million compared to operating income of $11.4 million in the third quarter last year. The quarter-on-quarter increase in international operations reflects higher commodity prices, increased production and lower exploration expense. The start-up of production in China also contributed to improved quarter-on-quarter earnings. International operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil during the quarter, which increased five percent compared to the third quarter of 2002. The average international realized crude oil price was $28.29 per Bbl compared to $26.83 per Bbl during the third quarter of 2002. The average international realized natural gas price, excluding Ecuador production that is eliminated as inter-company sales, was $1.03 per Mcf compared to 93 cents per Mcf last year. Third quarter 2003 international production volumes increased 20 percent to 30,935 Boepd from 25,734 Boepd last year. The increase in production volumes was primarily due to the start-up of crude oil production in China and significantly increased natural gas production in Ecuador. Maintenance related shut downs in the North Sea and construction downtime in Equatorial Guinea combined to partially offset increased international production. In Israel, Noble Energy has completed all construction necessary to begin natural gas production. The company expects to start production during the fourth quarter of 2003. Equatorial Guinea Total operating income in Equatorial Guinea, which includes results from field operations and methanol, for the third quarter of 2003 was $17.9 million compared to $12.8 million last year. Liquid petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and condensate sales accounted for $9.3 million, or 52 percent, of operating income from Equatorial Guinea. Although the Alba field was shut in for approximately ten days for construction tie-ins, third quarter 2003 production volumes averaged 11,758 Boepd, a one percent increase over last year. The average realized price for liquids during the third quarter 2003 was $27.10 per Bbl compared to $25.62 per Bbl for the same period last year. Natural gas was sold to the Atlantic Methanol Production Company (AMPCO) at a price of 25 cents per MMBTU. AMPCO, an unconsolidated subsidiary in which the company owns a 45 percent interest, produced $8.6 million of operating income net to Noble Energy's interest. AMPCO results are reported as income from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Third quarter realized methanol prices averaged 63 cents per Gal compared to 48 cents per Gal last year. The company's share of AMPCO methanol sales volumes was 28.4 million Gal compared to 31.3 million Gal for the third quarter of 2002, reflecting facility downtime associated with the construction shut-ins. 3
The Phase 2A condensate expansion project is expected to start-up during the fourth quarter of 2003. Phase 2A is expected to add gross production of 6,000 Bopd upon start-up, which is expected to occur in the first week of December. The project will reach its full incremental production of 29,000 Bopd in the first quarter of next year. Noble Energy has a 34 percent working interest in Phase 2A. North Sea In the North Sea, operating income for the third quarter of 2003 was $9.7 million compared to $10.5 million last year. North Sea production for the third quarter of 2003 was 8,773 Boepd compared to 9,803 Boepd last year, reflecting the temporary maintenance related shut-in of production at the Cook field. Other International Other international includes operating results from Argentina, China, Ecuador, Israel and Vietnam. In south Bohai Bay offshore China, production commenced from the CDX field on January 13, 2003. Production for the third quarter 2003 averaged 3,919 Bopd, net to Noble Energy. Noble Energy has a 57 percent working interest in this project. Noble Energy's Machala power plant operated at breakeven during the third quarter 2003. During the quarter, 184,470 megawatts (MW) were produced at an average sales price of 8.3 cents per kilowatt hour (Kwh). For the third quarter 2003, Noble Energy produced 21.2 MMcfpd of natural gas from the Amistad field at an average price of $3.73 per Mcf. The volume of natural gas and MW produced in Ecuador is related to thermal electricity demand in that country. Early in the third quarter, Ecuador had sufficient rainfall to allow hydroelectric power producers to provide base load power, while Noble Energy provided electricity to meet peak demand. As seasonal rains subsided during the third quarter, Noble Energy experienced increasing demand for thermal electricity. Noble Energy is one of the nation's leading independent energy companies and operates throughout major basins in the United States including the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally, in Argentina, China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea and Vietnam. Noble Energy markets natural gas and crude oil through its subsidiary, Noble Energy Marketing, Inc.
