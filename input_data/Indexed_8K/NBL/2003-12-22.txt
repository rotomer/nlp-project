EXHIBIT 99.1 (NOBLE ENERGY LOGO) PRESS RELEASE 100 GLENBOROUGH DRIVE SUITE 100 CONTACT: Greg Panagos: 281-872-3125 HOUSTON, TX 77067 Investor_Relations@nobleenergyinc.com NOBLE ENERGY, INC. PROVIDES UPDATE ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS HOUSTON (December 17, 2003) -- Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) today provided an update on its 2003 asset disposition program. As previously reported, the company identified five property packages for disposition. Bids have now been received on all five packages. Year-to-date, property sales have closed on four of the five packages, with the remaining property package expected to close during the first quarter of 2004. Total pretax proceeds on all five packages, before closing adjustments, are expected to be in excess of $110 million. During the third quarter, closed property sales resulted in a pretax gain of $9.9 million. Also during the third quarter, certain properties in two packages were classified as held for sale, written down by $18.3 million to fair value, pretax, and reported in discontinued operations. Subsequent to September 30, 2003, the remaining asset package met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. During the fourth quarter, Noble Energy has closed sales on properties located in California, Oklahoma and Wyoming. A package of Gulf of Mexico properties is expected to close during the first quarter 2004. The transfer of the remaining property package to discontinued operations and the timing of completed sales will result in a non-cash, pretax write-down to fair value and realized loss of approximately $40 million ($26 million after tax). The total non-cash charge will appear in discontinued operations for the fourth quarter. Noble Energy also announced today that it plans to write off its current investment in Vietnam during the fourth quarter, resulting in an after-tax charge of $5 million, including a pretax dry hole charge of approximately $20 million offset by a $15 million tax benefit for writing off the stock in the company's wholly-owned Vietnam subsidiary. Noble Energy is one of the nation's leading independent energy companies and operates throughout major basins in the United States including the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally, in Argentina, China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea. Noble Energy markets natural gas and crude oil through its subsidiary, Noble Energy Marketing, Inc.
