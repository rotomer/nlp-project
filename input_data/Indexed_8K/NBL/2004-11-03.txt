Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 28, 2004, Noble Energy, Inc.'s (the "Company") 364-day $300 million credit agreement expired (the "old Facility"), and the Company replaced the old Facility with a new $400 million unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "new Facility"). The new Facility has an option to increase the commitments to an aggregate $600 million. The new Facility was entered into among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent, Wachovia Bank, National Association ("Wachovia"), as syndication agent, Barclays Bank, PLC, Duetsche Bank AG New York Branch ("Duetsche") and The Royal Bank of Scotland, PLC ("RBS"), as co-documentation agents, and certain other commercial lending institutions named therein. The Company drew down $85 million under the new Facility on October 28, 2004 to repay the outstanding $85 million under the old Facility.
The new Facility is available for general corporate purposes. Interest rates are based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 30 basis points to 112.5 basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating. The new Facility has facility fees that range from 10 basis points to 25 basis depending upon the credit rating.
The new Facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, the following financial covenants: (a) the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Exploration Expense to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0; and (b) the total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, may not exceed 60 percent at any time. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the new Facility which would permit the participating banks to restrict the Company's ability to access the new Facility and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the new Facility.
Certain lenders that were (1) a party to the old Facility or (2) a party to the new Facility have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending or commercial banking services for the Company and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses.
The description set forth herein of the terms and conditions of the new Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1.

     SECTION 2.5 Borrowing Procedures for Loans. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior written or telegraphic notice pursuant to a Borrowing Request (in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.5 hereto) of each proposed Borrowing or continuation, and as to whether such Borrowing or continuation is to be of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, as follows:
     SECTION 2.5.1 Base Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent shall receive written or telegraphic notice from the Borrower on or before 2:00 p.m. Central time one (1) Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing and amount of such Borrowing (which shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000), and the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender thereof promptly thereafter. Not later than 10:00 a.m., Central time, on the date specified in such notice for such Borrowing, each Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office, same day or immediately available funds covering such Lender's Percentage of the requested Base Rate Loan. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V with respect to such Base Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower the proceeds of each Base Rate Loan (to the extent received from the Lenders) by wire transfer of such proceeds to such account(s) as the Borrower shall have specified in the Borrowing Request.
     SECTION 2.5.2 Eurodollar Loans. The Administrative Agent shall receive written or telegraphic notice pursuant to a Borrowing Request from the Borrower on or before 10:00 a.m. Central time, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date requested for each proposed Borrowing or continuation of a Eurodollar Loan, of the date of such Borrowing or continuation, as the case may be, the amount of such Borrowing or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000), and the duration of the initial Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto, and the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender thereof promptly thereafter. Not later than 10:00 a.m., Central time, on the date specified in such notice for such Borrowing, each Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office, same day or immediately available funds covering such Lender's Percentage of the requested Eurodollar Loan. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V with respect to such Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower the proceeds of each Eurodollar Loan (to the extent received from the Lenders) by wire transfer of such proceeds to such account(s) as the Borrower shall have specified in the Borrowing Request.
     SECTION 2.6 Continuation and Conversion Elections. By delivering a Continuation/Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent on or before 10:00 a.m., Central time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably elect, on not less than three (3) nor more than five (5) Business Days' notice that all, or any portion in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 of any Borrowings be, (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, converted into Eurodollar Loans, or (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, be converted into a Base Rate Loan or continued as a Eurodollar Loan of such Type (in the absence of delivery of a Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to any Eurodollar Loan at least three (3) Business Days before the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, such Eurodollar Loan shall, on such last day, automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan); provided, however, that (i) each such conversion or continuation shall be pro rated among the applicable outstanding Loans of all Lenders, and (ii) no portion of the outstanding
 
principal amount of any Loans may be continued as, or be converted into, Eurodollar Loans when any Default has occurred and is continuing.
     SECTION 2.7 Funding. Each Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its obligation to make, continue or convert Eurodollar Loans hereunder by causing one of its foreign branches or Affiliates (or an international banking facility created by such Lender) to make or maintain such Eurodollar Loan; provided, however, that such Eurodollar Loan shall nonetheless be deemed to have been made and to be held by such Lender, and the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Eurodollar Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender for the account of such foreign branch, Affiliate or international banking facility. In addition, the Borrower hereby consents and agrees that, for purposes of any determination to be made for purposes of Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, it shall be conclusively assumed that each Lender elected to fund all Eurodollar Loans by purchasing, as the case may be, Dollar deposits in its Eurodollar Office's interbank eurodollar market.
     SECTION 2.8 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
     (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date.
     (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
     (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
     (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
     (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit 2.8 hereto. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.10.1) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
     SECTION 2.9 Addition of Lenders and Increase in Commitment Amount. It is agreed by the parties hereto that, at any time before the Maturity Date, one or more financial institutions selected by the Borrower and acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion, may become a Lender under this Agreement, or any existing Lender may increase its Commitment, in each case in an amount approved by Borrower, in such financial institution's or Lender's sole discretion by executing and delivering to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.9 hereto (a "Lender Certificate"). Upon receipt and agreement by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any such Lender Certificate, (a) the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders (including any Person that becomes a Lender by delivery of such a Lender Certificate) automatically without further action by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be increased by the amount indicated in such Lender Certificate (but not in excess of $200,000,000 in the aggregate for all such increases in the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.9) on the effective date set forth in such Lender Certificate (such increased amount herein the "Increased Commitment Amount"), (b) Schedule II attached hereto shall be amended to add such Commitment of such additional Lender or to reflect the increase in the Commitment of an existing Lender and the Percentages of the Lenders shall be adjusted accordingly to reflect the additional Lender or in the increase in the Commitment of an existing Lender, and (c) any such additional Lender shall be deemed to be a party in all respect to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
     SECTION 3.1 Repayments and Prepayments. The Borrower shall repay in full the unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date. Prior thereto, the Borrower
     (a) may, from time to time on any Business Day, make a voluntary prepayment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding principal amount of any Loans; provided, however, that (i) any such prepayment shall be applied to the Lenders among Loans having the same Type and, if applicable, having the same Interest Period; (ii) all such voluntary prepayments shall require at least three Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; and (iii) all such voluntary partial prepayments shall be in an minimum amount of $10,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; and
     (b) shall, immediately upon any acceleration of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, repay all Loans unless, pursuant to Section 8.3, only a portion of all Loans is so accelerated.
Each prepayment of Loans shall be applied, to the extent of such prepayment, in the inverse order of maturity. Each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to this Section shall be without premium or penalty, except as may be required by Section 4.4. No voluntary prepayment of principal of any Loans shall cause a reduction in the Commitment Amount.
     SECTION 3.2 Interest Provisions. Interest on the outstanding principal amount of Loans shall accrue and be payable in accordance with this Section 3.2.
 
     SECTION 3.2.1 Rates. Pursuant to an appropriately delivered Borrowing Request or Continuation/Conversion Notice, the Borrower may elect that Loans comprising a Borrowing accrue interest at a rate per annum: (a) on that portion maintained from time to time as a Base Rate Loan, equal to the Base Rate from time to time in effect; and (b) on that portion maintained as a Eurodollar Loan, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. All Eurodollar Borrowings shall bear interest from and including the first day of the applicable Interest Period to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such Eurodollar Borrowing.
     SECTION 3.2.2 Post-Maturity Rates. After the date any principal amount of any Loan is due and payable (whether on the Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise), or after any other monetary Obligation of the Borrower shall have become due and payable, the Borrower shall pay, but only to the extent permitted by law, interest (after as well as before judgment) on such amounts at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Default Margin.
     SECTION 3.2.3 Payment Dates. Interest accrued on each Borrowing shall be payable, without duplication on the following dates (each a "Payment Date"): (a) on the Maturity Date; (b) on the date of any payment or prepayment, in whole or in part, of principal outstanding on such Loan on the amount of such principal prepaid or repaid; (c) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on each Quarterly Payment Date occurring after the Effective Date; (d) with respect to Eurodollar Borrowings, on the last day of each applicable Interest Period (and, if such Interest Period shall exceed three months, every three months from the first day of such Interest Period); (e) with respect to any portion of Base Rate Loans converted into Eurodollar Loans on a day when interest would not otherwise have been payable pursuant to clause (c), on the date of such conversion; and (f) on that portion of any Borrowings the Maturity Date of which is accelerated pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, immediately upon such acceleration.
     SECTION 3.3 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the fees set forth in this Section 3.3. All such fees shall be non-refundable.
     SECTION 3.3.1 Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee in an amount equal to the product of the Applicable Facility Fee Rate times such Lender's Percentage of Commitments times the Commitment Amount. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Maturity Date.
     SECTION 3.3.2 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account and for the account of each Lender and Arranger, respectively, all fees (including any fees pursuant to Section 2.2.8) pursuant to (i) that certain fee letter, dated September 7, 2004, between the Borrower, Administrative Agent and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as amended from time to time and (ii) that certain fee letter, dated September 7, 2004, between the Borrower, Syndication Agent and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as amended from time to time (collectively, the "Fee Letters").
     SECTION 3.3.3 Payment Office. The Borrower shall make all payments to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office.
 
     SECTION 4.1 Eurodollar Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, upon notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to make, continue or maintain any Borrowing as, or to convert any Borrowing into, a Eurodollar Borrowing, the obligations of such Lender to make, continue, maintain or convert any such Borrowings shall, upon such determination, forthwith be suspended until such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all Eurodollar Borrowings shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required by such law or assertion; provided, however, that the obligation of such Lender to make, continue, maintain or convert any such Eurodollar Borrowings shall remain unaffected if such Lender can designate a different Eurodollar Office for the making, continuance, maintenance or conversion of Eurodollar Borrowings and such designation will not, in the sole discretion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
     SECTION 4.2 Deposits Unavailable or Eurodollar Interest Rate Unascertainable. If the Administrative Agent shall have determined that, by reason of circumstances affecting the Administrative Agent's relevant market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable hereunder to Eurodollar Borrowings, then, upon notice from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower and the Lenders, the obligations of all Lenders under Section 2.5.2 and Section 2.6 to make or continue any Borrowings as, or to convert any Borrowings into, Eurodollar Borrowings shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
     SECTION 4.3 Increased Eurodollar Borrowing Costs, etc. The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender for any increase in the cost to such Lender of, or any reduction in the amount of any sum receivable by such Lender in respect of, making, continuing or maintaining (or of its obligation to make, continue or maintain) any Borrowings as, or of converting (or of its obligation to convert) any Borrowings into, Eurodollar Borrowings. Such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of the occurrence of any such event, such notice to state, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the additional amount required fully to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount; provided, however, that such Lender shall designate a different Eurodollar Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole discretion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Such additional amounts shall be payable by the Borrower directly to such Lender within fifteen days of its receipt of such notice, and such notice shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the amount payable by the Borrower.
     SECTION 4.4 Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall incur any loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to make, continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Borrowing as, or to convert any portion of the principal amount of any Borrowing into, a Eurodollar Borrowing) as a result of (a) any conversion or repayment or
 
prepayment of the principal amount of any Eurodollar Borrowings on a date other than the scheduled last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to Section 3.1 or otherwise, (b) any Borrowings not being made as Eurodollar Borrowings in accordance with the Borrowing Request therefor, (c) any Borrowings not being continued as, or converted into, Eurodollar Borrowings in accordance with the Continuation/Conversion Notice, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Borrowing other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 4.10, then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, within fifteen days of its receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender such amount as will (in the reasonable determination of such Lender) reimburse such Lender for such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include calculations in reasonable detail) shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the amount payable by the Borrower.
     SECTION 4.5 Increased Capital Costs. If any change in, or the introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation, reinterpretation or phase-in of, any law or regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request (whether or not having the force of law) of any court, central bank, regulator or other governmental authority affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Person controlling such Lender, and such Lender determines (in its sole discretion) that the rate of return on its or such controlling Person's capital as a consequence of its Commitments or the Borrowings made by such Lender is reduced to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for the occurrence of any such circumstance, then, in any such case upon notice from time to time by such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay directly to such Lender, within fifteen days, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of return; provided, however, that such Lender shall designate a different Domestic or Eurodollar Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole discretion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A statement of such Lender as to any such additional amount or amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable detail) shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the amount payable by the Borrower. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable method of averaging and attribution that it (in its sole discretion) shall deem applicable.
     SECTION 4.6 Taxes. All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and interest on, the Borrowings and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding franchise taxes and taxes imposed on or measured by any Lender's net income or receipts (such non-excluded items being called "Taxes"). In the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower will, within fifteen days (a) pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted; (b) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority; and (c) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually
 
received by each Lender will equal the full amount such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required.
     If any Taxes are directly asserted against the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any payment received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may pay such Taxes and the Borrower will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by such person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such person would have received had not such Taxes been asserted; provided that the Borrower will not be obligated to pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent or such Lender to the extent that such additional amounts shall have been incurred as a consequence of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as the case may be.
     If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Lender as a result of any such failure. For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.
     Each Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States shall, prior to the due date of any payments of the Loans under this Agreement, execute and deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or about the first scheduled Payment Date in each Fiscal Year, one or more (as the Borrower or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request) United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or Form W-8 ECI or such other forms or documents (or successor forms or documents), appropriately completed, as may be applicable to establish the extent, if any, to which a payment to such Lender is exempt from withholding or deduction of Taxes, and shall (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent additional copies of such forms on or before the date that such forms expire or become obsolete or after the occurrence of an event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered by it and such amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or fees or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from the definition of "Taxes". For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the forms required pursuant to this paragraph, if any (other than if such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States which Taxes would not have been imposed but for such failure to provide such form; provided, however, that should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject
 
to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.
     If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section, then such Lender will change the jurisdiction of its applicable Eurodollar or Domestic Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the sole discretion of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. No Lender shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under this Section as a result of the designation by such Lender of a different applicable Eurodollar or Domestic Office after the date hereof, unless such designation is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Sections 4.1, 4.3 or 4.5 requiring such Lender to designate a different applicable Eurodollar or Domestic Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.
     SECTION 4.7 Special Fees in Respect of Reserve Requirements. With respect to Eurodollar Borrowings, the Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender on appropriate Payment Dates, as additional interest, such amounts as will compensate such Lender for any cost to such Lender, from time to time, of any reserve, special deposit, special assessment or similar capital requirements against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such Lender which are imposed on, or deemed applicable by, such Lender, from time to time, under or pursuant to (i) any Law, treaty, regulation or directive now or hereafter in effect (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System but excluding any reserve requirement included in the definition of Eurodollar Rate in Section 1.1), (ii) any interpretation or application thereof by any governmental authority, agency or instrumentality charged with the administration thereof or by any court, central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority having jurisdiction over the Eurodollar Borrowings or the office of such Lender where its Eurodollar Borrowings are lodged, or (iii) any requirement imposed or requested by any court, governmental authority, agency or instrumentality or central bank, fiscal, monetary or other authority, whether or not having the force of law. A written notice as to the amount of any such cost or any change therein (including calculations, in reasonable detail, showing how such Lender computed such cost or change) shall be promptly furnished by such Lender to the Borrower and shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of such cost or change. The Borrower will not be responsible for paying any amounts pursuant to this Section accruing prior to 180 days prior to the receipt by the Borrower of the written notice referred to in the preceding sentence. Within fifteen (15) days after such certificate is furnished to the Borrower, the Borrower will pay directly to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such cost or change.
     SECTION 4.8 Payments, Computations, etc. Unless otherwise expressly provided, all payments by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of the Lenders entitled to receive such payment. All such payments required to be made to the Administrative Agent shall be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m., Central time, on the date due, in same day or immediately available funds, to such account as the Administrative Agent shall specify from time to time by notice to the Borrower. Funds received
 
after that time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit in same day funds to each Lender its share, if any, of such payments received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender. All interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring during the period for which such interest or fee is payable over a year comprised of 360 days (or, in the case of interest on a Base Rate Loan, 365 days or, if appropriate, 366 days). Whenever any payment to be made shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall (except as otherwise required by clause (c) of the definition of the term "Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Loans) be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.
     SECTION 4.9 Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Loan (other than pursuant to the terms of Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5) in excess of its pro rata share of payments then or therewith obtained by all Lenders, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such selling Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such selling Lender's required repayment to the purchasing Lender to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a set off to which this Section applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
     SECTION 4.10 Replacement of Lender on Account of Increased Costs, Eurodollar Lending Unlawful, Reserve Requirements, Taxes, Certain Dissents, etc. If any Lender shall claim the inability to make or maintain Eurodollar Borrowings pursuant to Section 4.1 above, if any Lender is owed increased costs under Section 4.5 above, if any payment to any Lender by the Borrower is subject to any withholding tax pursuant to Section 4.6 above, or if any Lender is owed any cost or expense pursuant to Section 4.7 above, the Borrower shall have the right, if no Event of Default or Default then exists, to replace such Lender with another bank or financial institution provided that (i) if it is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, such bank or financial institution shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and (ii) such bank or financial institution shall unconditionally purchase, in accordance with Section 10.10 hereof, all of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the appropriate pro rata share of such Lender's Loans and Commitments, without recourse or
 
expense to, or warranty by, such Lender being replaced for a purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans payable to such Lender, plus any accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans, plus accrued but unpaid fees in respect of such Lender's Borrowings and Percentage of the Commitments hereunder to the date of such purchase on a date therein specified. The Borrower shall be obligated to pay, simultaneously with such purchase and sale, the increased costs, amounts, expenses and taxes under Sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 above, any amounts payable under Section 4.4 and all other costs, fees and expenses payable to such Lender hereunder and under the Loan Documents, to the date of such purchase as well as all other Obligations due and payable to or for the benefit of such Lender; provided, that if such bank or financial institution fails to purchase such rights and obligations, the Borrower shall continue to be obligated to pay the increased costs, amounts, expenses and taxes under Sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 above to such Lender.
     SECTION 4.11 Maximum Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto to conform strictly to applicable usury laws and, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this Agreement shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to the extent that receipt thereof would be contrary to provisions of law applicable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by the Administrative Agent or such Lender. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious under applicable law (including the Federal and state laws of the United States of America, or of any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable) with respect to the Administrative Agent or a Lender then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is agreed as follows: (a) the provisions of this Section shall govern and control; (b) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law that is contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement, or under any of the other aforesaid agreements or otherwise in connection with this Agreement by the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law (such maximum lawful interest rate, if any, with respect to such Lender herein called the "Highest Lawful Rate"), and any excess shall be credited to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or, if such consideration shall have been paid in full, such excess refunded to the Borrower); (c) all sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such Lender for the use, forbearance and detention of the Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such Indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform throughout the full term thereof; and (d) if at any time the interest provided pursuant to Section 4.1 together with any other fees payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and deemed interest under applicable law, exceeds that amount which would have accrued at the Highest Lawful Rate, the amount of interest and any such fees to accrue to the Administrative Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to that amount which would have accrued at the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions, as applicable, shall not reduce the interest to accrue to the Administrative Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Agreement below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued pursuant to this Agreement and such fees deemed to be interest equals the amount of interest which would have accrued to the Administrative Agent or such Lender if a varying rate per annum equal to the interest provided pursuant to Section 3.2 had at all times
 
been in effect, plus the amount of fees which would have been received but for the effect of this Section. For purposes of Section 303.201 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, to the extent, if any, applicable to the Administrative Agent or a Lender, the Borrower agrees that the Highest Lawful Rate shall be the "indicated (weekly) rate ceiling" as defined in said Section, provided that the Administrative Agent or such Lender may also rely, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, on alternative maximum rates of interest under other laws applicable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender if greater. Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and revolving tri-party accounts (formerly Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. Art. 5069, Ch. 15)) shall not apply to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to act on behalf of such Lender under this Agreement and each other Loan Document and, in the absence of other written instructions from the Required Lenders received from time to time by the Administrative Agent (with respect to which the Administrative Agent agrees that it will comply, except as otherwise provided in this Section or as otherwise advised by counsel), to exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Syndication Agent or the Co-Documentation Agents have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in connection with their capacity as either the Syndication Agent or a Co-Documentation Agent, respectively. Each Lender hereby indemnifies (which indemnity shall survive any termination of this Agreement) each of the Agents, pro rata according to such Lender's Percentage, , from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement and any other Loan Document, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and as to which such Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrower; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses which are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final proceeding to have resulted solely from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. None of the Agents shall be required to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, unless it is indemnified hereunder to its satisfaction.

the day prior to a Borrowing (except with respect to a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans, in which case notice shall be given no later than 12:00 noon, Central time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available the amount which would constitute its Percentage of such Borrowing on the date specified therefor, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date the Administrative Agent made such amount available to the Borrower to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Any such inquiry which may be made by any Agent shall not obligate it to make any further inquiry or to take any action.

     SECTION 9.4 Successor. Any of the Agents may resign as such at any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the Borrower and all Lenders. If the Administrative Agent at any time shall resign, the Required Lenders may appoint another Lender as the successor Administrative Agent which shall thereupon become the Administrative Agent hereunder. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be one of the Lenders or a commercial banking institution organized under the laws of the U.S. (or any State thereof) or a U.S. branch or agency of a commercial banking institution, and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive from the retiring Administrative Agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such successor Administrative Agent may reasonably request, and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After a retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as a Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, and Section 10.4 (and, with respect to the Administrative Agent, Section 10.3) shall continue to inure to its benefit.
 
     SECTION 9.5 Loans by the Agents. Each of the Agents shall have the same rights and powers with respect to the Loans made by it or any of its Affiliates and may exercise the same as if it were not a Agent. Each of the Agents and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not a Agent hereunder.
     SECTION 9.6 Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it has made its own credit decision to extend its Commitments hereunder (i) independently of each of the Agents and each other Lender, and (ii) based on such Lender's review of the financial information of the Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents (the terms and provisions of which being satisfactory to such Lender) and such other documents, information and investigations as such Lender has deemed appropriate. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will continue to make its own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and privileges available to it under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (i) independently of each of the Agents and each other Lender, and (ii) based on such other documents, information and investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time.
     SECTION 9.7 Copies, etc. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to each Lender of each notice or request required or permitted to be given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (unless concurrently delivered to the Lenders by the Borrower). The Administrative Agent will distribute to each Lender each document or instrument received for its account and copies of all other communications received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower for distribution to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
     SECTION 10.1 Waivers, Amendments, etc. The provisions of this Agreement and of each other Loan Document may from time to time be amended, modified or waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and consented to by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such amendment, modification or waiver which would: (a) modify any requirement hereunder that any particular action be taken by all the Lenders or by the Required Lenders shall be effective unless consented to by each Lender; (b) modify this Section 10.1, change the definition of "Required Lenders", reduce any fees described in Article III or extend the Maturity Date, shall be made without the consent of each Lender; (c) extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of, any scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or interest on any Loan (or reduce the principal amount of or rate of interest on any Loan) shall be made without the consent of the Lender which made such Loan; or (d) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of any Agent as an Agent shall be made without the consent of such Agent; provided, further, that no such amendment, modification or waiver which would either increase any Commitment, Commitment Amount or the Percentage of any Lender, or modify the rights, duties or obligations of any Agent, shall be effective without the consent of such Lender or such Agent, as applicable. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any power or right under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
 
of any other power or right. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, except as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted hereunder.

Each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent on demand for such Lender's pro rata share (based upon its respective Percentage) of any such costs or expenses not paid by the Borrower. In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative Agent, the other Agents, the Arrangers, and the Lenders harmless from all liability for, any stamp or other taxes which may be payable in connection with the execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Borrowings hereunder, or of any other instruments or documents provided for herein or delivered or to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith.
