Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
      On April 4, 2005, Noble Energy, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a new $1,300,000,000 unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "Facility"). The Facility contains provisions that reduce the commitments over time and upon the consummation of certain sales of assets and certain issuances of debt. The Facility was entered into among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Wachovia Bank, National Association and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, as co-syndication agents, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Citibank, N.A., as co-documentation agents, and certain other commercial lending institutions named therein. The Company will draw down on the Facility contemporaneously with the planned acquisition of Patina Oil & Gas Corporation (the "Acquisition").
      The Facility is available (a) to fund the Acquisition (b) to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company and Patina Oil & Gas Corporation, and (c) for general corporate purposes. Interest rates are based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 30 basis points to 100 basis points depending upon the Company's credit rating. The Facility has facility fees that range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points depending upon the Company's credit rating.
      The Facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, the following financial covenants: (a) the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Exploration Expense to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0; and (b) the total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, may not exceed 60 percent at any time. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility which would permit the participating banks to restrict the Company's ability to access the Facility and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility.
      Certain lenders that are a party to the Facility have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending or commercial banking services for the Company and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses.
      The description set forth herein of the terms and conditions of the Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1.
      Please see the discussion set forth in response to Item 1.01, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

In the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower will, within fifteen days (a) pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted; (b) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority; and (c) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender will equal the full amount such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required.
Taxes
Taxes
     If any Taxes are directly asserted against the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any payment received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may pay such Taxes and the Borrower will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by such person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such person would have received had not such Taxes been asserted; provided that the Borrower will not be obligated to pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent or such Lender to the extent that such additional amounts shall have been incurred as a consequence of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as the case may be.
     If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Lender as a result of any such failure. For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.
     Each Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States shall, prior to the due date of any payments of the Loans under this Agreement, execute and deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or about the first scheduled Payment Date in each Fiscal Year, one or more (as the Borrower or the Administrative Agent may
 
reasonably request) United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or Form W-8 ECI or such other forms or documents (or successor forms or documents), appropriately completed, as may be applicable to establish the extent, if any, to which a payment to such Lender is exempt from withholding or deduction of Taxes, and shall (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent additional copies of such forms on or before the date that such forms expire or become obsolete or after the occurrence of an event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered by it and such amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or fees or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from the definition of "Taxes". For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the forms required pursuant to this paragraph, if any (other than if such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States which Taxes would not have been imposed but for such failure to provide such form; provided, however, that should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.
     If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section, then such Lender will change the jurisdiction of its applicable Eurodollar or Domestic Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the sole discretion of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. No Lender shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under this Section as a result of the designation by such Lender of a different applicable Eurodollar or Domestic Office after the date hereof, unless such designation is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of , or requiring such Lender to designate a different applicable Eurodollar or Domestic Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

A written notice as to the amount of any such cost or any change therein (including calculations, in reasonable detail, showing how such Lender computed such cost or change) shall be promptly furnished by such Lender to the Borrower and shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of such cost or change. The Borrower will not be responsible for paying any amounts pursuant to this Section accruing prior to 180 days prior to the receipt by the Borrower of the written notice referred to in the preceding sentence. Within fifteen (15) days after such certificate is furnished to the Borrower, the Borrower will pay directly to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such cost or change.
     SECTION 4.8 Unless otherwise expressly provided, all payments by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders entitled to receive such payment. All such payments required to be made to the Administrative Agent shall be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m., Central time, on the date due, in same day or immediately available funds, to such account as the Administrative Agent shall specify from time to time by notice to the Borrower. Funds received after that time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit in same day funds to each Lender its share, if any, of such payments received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender. All interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring during the period for which such interest or fee is payable over a year comprised of 360 days (or, in the case of interest on a Base Rate Loan, 365 days or, if appropriate, 366 days). Whenever any payment to be made shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall (except as otherwise required by of the definition of the term "" with respect to Eurodollar Loans) be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.

     Where facts material to the opinions hereinafter expressed were not independently established by us, we have relied upon the representations and warranties made to you by Borrower in the Loan Documents and upon oral and written statements of and information furnished by officers of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, where we deemed such reliance appropriate under the circumstances. We have necessarily assumed the accuracy and completeness of such representations, warranties, statements and other information.
     Based on the foregoing and on the assumptions hereinafter set forth, and subject to the exceptions, limitations and qualifications hereinafter expressed, it is our opinion that:
     1. Borrower is a duly incorporated and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and
 
authority to own its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged. Borrower is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in the State of Texas. Borrower has the corporate power to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such Loan Documents.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of the Agreement and each other Loan Document executed by it are within its corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not (i) violate the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Borrower, (ii) violate, constitute a breach of or result in the imposition or creation of (or the obligation to impose or create) a Lien pursuant to, any of the terms or provisions of any indenture, loan agreement or other agreement to which Borrower is a party or by which Borrower or its property is bound that is filed as (or incorporated by reference as) an exhibit to Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, (iii) violate any applicable statute, rule or regulation of any governmental body of the United States of America or the State of Texas, or (iv) to the knowledge of the undersigned, any court decree or order binding upon Borrower.
     3. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body pursuant to any law or any rule or order of general application is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by Borrower of any Loan Document to which it is a party.
     4. Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.
     5. Each of the Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party has been duly executed and delivered by Borrower. The Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability.
     6. To the knowledge of the undersigned, there is no pending or threatened litigation, action, proceeding, or labor controversy affecting Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, properties, businesses, assets or revenues, which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of, or the rights and remedies of Agent and the Lenders under, the Agreement or any other Loan Document.
     The opinions expressed above are based in part upon the assumptions, and are subject to the exceptions, limitations and qualifications, set forth below:
 
     (a) Whenever any opinion expressed herein with respect to any matter is qualified by the phrase "to the knowledge of the undersigned," such phrase (A) indicates that (i) no information has come to the attention of any attorney of this firm who has devoted substantive attention to the transactions contemplated in the Agreement that has given any such person actual knowledge concerning such matter different from that expressed in such opinion; (ii) except as otherwise stated herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation with respect to such matter but have relied on representations made by Borrower in the Loan Documents and on information otherwise provided to us by it; and (iii) no inference that any such person has actual knowledge concerning such matters should be drawn from the fact of our representation of Borrower and its Subsidiaries or our expression of such opinion; and (B) does not encompass the actual knowledge of any attorney of this firm who obtained such knowledge in his capacity as a director of Borrower.
     (b) Except as expressly set forth herein, we have made no independent investigation as to the accuracy or completeness of any representation, warranty, data or other information, written or oral, made or furnished in or in connection with the Loan Documents, or otherwise.
     (c) We do not purport to be experts as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas and the United States of America, and we express no opinion herein with respect to the laws of any such other jurisdiction, except insofar as the matters covered by the foregoing opinions may involve or be governed by or construed under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Our opinion regarding the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is confined to our reading thereof without application of judicial or administration interpretations thereof.
     (d) In rendering certain of the opinions expressed above, we have assumed that each of the Agents and Lenders (i) are duly authorized to execute and deliver (or accept), and have duly executed and delivered (or accepted), the Loan Documents required to be executed and delivered (or accepted) by it and (ii) each Lender will fund the Loans to the extent required to be funded by it under the Agreement.
     (e) We express no opinion concerning (i) any right of any Agent or any Lender or any other person to be indemnified against (or released from the consequences of) its own negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) the enforceability of any obligations of any party other than Borrower; (iii) the effectiveness or enforceability of provisions restricting access to courts or to legal or equitable remedies or purporting to affect jurisdiction or venue; or (iv) the effectiveness or enforceability of any waiver of the right to trial by jury or any rights or benefits that cannot be waived under applicable law.
     (f) For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed that the Borrower is, and in connection with each incurrence of Indebtedness under the Agreement will be, in compliance with the covenants contained in and of (i) the Agreement, (ii) the $400,000,000 Credit Agreement dated as of November 30, 2001, as amended, among Borrower (formerly known as Noble Affiliates, Inc.), JPMorgan Chase Bank as Administrative Agent, and the Co-Documentation Agents, Syndication Agent

and Lenders referred to therein, and (iii) the $400,000,000 Credit Agreement dated as of October 28, 2004, as amended, among Borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank as Administrative Agent, and the Co-Documentation Agents, Syndication Agent and Lenders referred to therein; and contained in of: (i) the Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 30, 2004, among Noble Energy Mediterranean Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation as Initial Lender and as Agent for the Lenders, (ii) the Term Loan Agreement dated as of February 2, 2004, among Noble Energy Mediterranean Ltd., Bank One, NA as Agent for the Lenders and certain commercial lending institutions, and (iii) the Term Loan Agreement dated as of February 4, 2004, among Noble Energy Mediterranean Ltd., the Royal Bank of Scotland Finance (Ireland) as Agent for the Lenders and as the initial Lender, each of which and are worded identically to and of the Agreement.
