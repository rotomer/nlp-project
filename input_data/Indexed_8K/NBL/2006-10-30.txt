Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     Executive Change of Control Plan
     On October 24, 2006, the Board of Directors of Noble Energy, Inc. (the "Company") approved and adopted the Noble Energy, Inc. Change of Control Severance Plan for Executives (the "Change of Control Plan") effective as of that date. Executive officers and certain key employees of the Company are now covered by the Change of Control Plan, provided that they are not already party to pre-existing change of control agreements with the Company. Certain executive officers (including all of the named executive officers) of the Company, however, are parties to individual change of control agreements and therefore may not participate in the Change of Control Plan at this time. The pre-existing change of control agreements with our named executive officers are described in the Company's 2006 annual proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2006.
     The new Change of Control Plan includes provisions regarding the severance package that an executive officer of the Company may be entitled to if he or she is terminated within two years after a change of control of the Company. A change of control will be deemed to have occurred if any of the following conditions occur:
     If the Company terminates the executive officer for cause or the executive officer's termination of employment occurs by reason of disability or death, no benefit is payable to or with respect to such executive under the Change of Control Plan. A termination for cause may only be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.
     If the Company terminates the executive officer for any other reason within two years after a change of control of the Company, then the Company will pay or provide the following to that individual:
Table of Contents
     The Change of Control Plan also provides for a tax gross-up payment to the executive that will fully offset the effect of (i) any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code upon the benefits payable under the Change of Control Plan (or under any other Company plan, arrangement or agreement), and (ii) any federal, state or local income tax or additional Section 4999 excise tax that is attributable to the tax gross-up payment.
     Amendment to Deferred Compensation Plan
     On October 24, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company also approved amending the Noble Energy, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan dated August 1, 2006, to provide that any profit sharing contribution otherwise allocable to an eligible employee hired after April 30, 2006, that cannot be credited to such employee's account under the Noble Energy, Inc. Thrift and Profit Sharing Plan because of the Internal Revenue Code's maximum annual addition or maximum annual compensation limitation will be credited to such employee's account under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On October 24, 2006, in connection with the adoption of the Change of Control Plan described in Item 1.01 above (and the adoption of a new Noble Energy, Inc. Change of Control Severance Plan covering eligible non-executive employees), the Board of Directors terminated the Noble Affiliates, Inc. Change of Control Severance Plan that was adopted by the Board on October 23, 2001.

     2.1 Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2, if a Covered Employee's employment by the Employer terminates in an Involuntary Termination described in Section 1.1(i)(1), Section 1.1(i)(2) or Section 1.1(n)(1) which occurs within two (2) years after a Change of Control occurs, or to an Involuntary Termination described in Section 1.1(i)(3) which occurs within one (1) year after a Change of Control occurs, the Employer shall:
Severance Benefits.
     (a) pay to such Covered Employee on his or her Payment Date an amount in cash equal to the sum of all unpaid salary due to, and unreimbursed expenses incurred by, such Covered Employee in the performance of his or her duties for the Employer through the date of such Involuntary Termination;
     (b) pay to such Covered Employee on his or her Payment Date an amount in cash equal to such Covered Employee's Annual Cash Compensation multiplied by the Applicable Factor that applies to such Covered Employee;
     (c) pay to such Covered Employee on his or her Payment Date an amount in cash equal to such Covered Employee's prorata (measured as the number of days expired, as of the annual date of such Involuntary Termination, in the then-current annual bonus period, divided by 365) target bonus for the then-current annual bonus period;
 
     (d) upon receiving a detailed invoice for same, reimburse such Covered Employee, up to a maximum cumulative amount of $15,000, for the reasonable fees of no more than one (1) out-placement or similar service provider engaged by such Covered Employee to assist in finding employment opportunities for such Covered Employee during the one-year period following the date of such Involuntary Termination; and
     (e) provide such Covered Employee with continued Welfare Benefit Coverages for himself or herself and, where applicable, his or her eligible dependents, for the period of months following the date of such Involuntary Termination that is specified for such Covered Employee on the attached Schedule A; provided, however, that (1) the Covered Employee must continue to pay the premiums paid by active employees of the Employer from time to time for such coverages, and (2) no medical, dental or vision care expense payment or reimbursement shall be made under such coverages to or with respect to such Covered Employee or his or her eligible dependents after December 31 of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which such Involuntary Termination occurred. Such benefit rights shall apply only to those Welfare Benefit Coverages that the Employer has in effect from time to time for active employees. If the Employer determines that providing one of the Welfare Benefit Coverages under a welfare plan maintained by the Employer will fail to satisfy a nondiscrimination requirement that the Employer intended such welfare plan to satisfy, then instead of providing such benefit under such welfare plan, the Employer may provide such benefit to or with respect to such Covered Employee under another plan or insurance arrangement. Welfare Benefit Coverages shall immediately end upon the Covered Employee's obtainment of new employment and eligibility for similar Welfare Benefit Coverages (with the Covered Employee being obligated hereunder to promptly report such eligibility to the Employer).
The severance benefits payable under this Section 2.1 (1) shall be deemed to be severance pay subject to any required tax withholding, and (2) shall not constitute compensation that is taken into account for the purposes of determining benefits or allocating contributions under any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of ERISA) maintained by the Employer.
     2.2 Any provision of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, as a condition to the receipt of any severance benefit hereunder, a Covered Employee whose employment by the Employer terminates in an Involuntary Termination shall execute a release and indemnity, in such reasonable form as may be approved by the Committee, releasing the Board, the Committee, the Employer and the Employer's affiliates, shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from, and indemnifying each such party against, any and all claims and causes of action of any kind or character, including but not limited to all claims or causes of action arising out of such Covered Employee's employment with the Employer, the termination of such employment and the performance of the Employer's obligations hereunder, and the receipt by such Covered Employee of any benefit provided hereunder shall constitute full settlement of all such claims and causes of action of such Covered Employee.
Release and Full Settlement
.
     2.3 A Covered Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Article II by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Article II be reduced by any compensation or benefit earned by the Covered Employee as the result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits. The benefits under the Plan are in addition to any other benefits to which a Covered Employee is otherwise entitled.
Mitigation.
 
     2.4 . In the event that (a) a Covered Employee becomes entitled to the severance benefits provided under Section 2.1 (the "Change of Control Benefits") and any of the Change of Control Benefits will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision, or (b) any payments or benefits received or to be received by such Covered Employee pursuant to the terms of any other plan, arrangement or agreement (the "Other Benefits") will be subject to the Excise Tax, the Employer shall pay to such Covered Employee an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by such Covered Employee, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Change of Control Benefits and the Other Benefits, and any federal, state and local income tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this Section 2.4, shall be equal to the Change of Control Benefits and the Other Benefits.
Gross-Up Payment
     For purposes of determining whether any of the Change of Control Benefits or the Other Benefits will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax:
     (1) any payments or benefits received or to be received by such Covered Employee in connection with a change in control of the Employer or such Covered Employee's termination of employment (whether pursuant to the terms of the Plan or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Employer, any person whose actions result in change in control or any person affiliated with the Employer or such persons) shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, except to the extent that, in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Board, such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or such excess payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code,
     (2) the amount of the Change of Control Benefits and the Other Benefits that shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the total amount of the Change of Control Benefits and the Other Benefits or (B) the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of Sections 280G(b)(1) and (4) (after applying subparagraph (1) above), and
     (3) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by tax counsel, selected by the Board, in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
     For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, such Covered Employee shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of taxation in the state and locality of the such Covered Employee's residence on the date of termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of such Covered Employee's employment, such Covered Employee shall repay to the Employer at that time that amount of such reduction in Excise Tax as is finally determined to be the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise
 
Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of the termination of such Covered Employee's employment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Employer shall make an additional gross-up payment to such Covered Employee in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
     2.5 Any provision of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, if during the six-month period immediately prior to a Change of Control a Covered Employee was employed by the Employer in a job category or position that would provide greater benefits under the Plan than would be provided under the Plan for such Covered Employee with respect to his or her job category or position with the Employer immediately prior to such Change of Control, then in lieu of the benefits applicable under the Plan to such Covered Employee's job category or position with the Employer immediately prior to such Change of Control, such Covered Employee shall be entitled to receive under the Plan the benefits under the Plan that apply to such Covered Employee's job category or position with the Employer during the six-month period immediately prior to such Change of Control that provides the greatest benefits to such Covered Employee.
Six-Month Lookback Alternate Benefits
.
     3.1 It shall be a principal duty of the Committee to see that the Plan is carried out, in accordance with its terms, for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to participate in the Plan. The Committee shall be the Plan's named fiduciary and shall have full power to administer the Plan in all of its details, subject to applicable requirements of law. For this purpose, the Committee's powers shall include, but not be limited to, the following authority, in addition to all other powers provided by the Plan:

     3.2 No member of the Committee may act, vote, or otherwise influence a decision of the Committee specifically relating to himself or herself as a participant in the Plan.
Member's Own Participation.
     3.3 The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee against any and all expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her administrative functions or fiduciary responsibilities with respect to the Plan, including any expenses and liabilities that are caused by or result from an act or omission constituting the negligence of such member in the performance of such functions or responsibilities, but excluding expenses and liabilities that are caused by or result from such member's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Expenses against which such member shall be indemnified hereunder shall include, without limitation, the amounts of any settlement or judgment, costs, counsel fees, and related charges reasonably incurred in connection with a claim asserted or a proceeding brought or settlement thereof.

     3.4 The members of the Committee shall not receive compensation for their services as members of the Committee.

In any case in which a claim for a Plan benefit is submitted by a Covered Employee, the Committee shall furnish written notice to the claimant within sixty (60) days (or within 120 days if additional information requested by the Committee necessitates an extension of the sixty-day period), which notice shall:

In connection with such request, the Covered Employee or his or her representative may review any pertinent documents upon which such denial or modification was based and may submit issues and comments in writing. Within sixty (60) days following such request for review, the Committee shall, after providing a full and fair review, render its final decision in writing to the Covered Employee and his or her representative, if any, stating specific reasons for such decision and making specific references to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the decision is based. If special circumstances require an extension of such sixty-day period, the Committee's decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review. If an extension of time for review is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Covered Employee and his or her representative, if any, prior to the commencement of the extension period.
     3.6 If a Covered Employee or his or her representative is not satisfied with the decision of the Committee pursuant to the Plan's claims review procedure, such Covered Employee or his or her representative may, within sixty (60) days of receipt of the written decision of the Committee, request by written notice to the Committee that his or her claim be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the employee benefit plan claims arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Such arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive procedure available to a Covered Employee or his or her representative for review of a decision of the Committee. In reviewing the decision of the Committee, the arbitrator shall use the standard of review that would be used by a Federal court in reviewing such decision under the provisions of ERISA. The Covered Employee or his or her representative and the Employer shall share equally the cost of such arbitration, including but not limited to the fees of the arbitrator and reasonable attorneys' fees, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding on both parties. Judgment upon the arbitrator's decision may be entered in any court of appropriate jurisdiction, and may not be challenged in any court, either at the place of arbitration or elsewhere.

     (1) no such amendment, modification or termination which would adversely affect the benefits or protections provided under the Plan to any individual who is a Covered Employee on the date such amendment, modification or termination is adopted shall be effective as it relates to such individual unless no Change of Control occurs within one year after such adoption, and any such attempted amendment, modification or termination adopted within one year prior to a Change of Control shall be null and void ab initio as it relates to such individual (it being understood that the removal of a Covered Employee from participation in the Plan shall, for the purposes of this Section, constitute an adverse affect to the benefits or protections provided under the Plan to any Covered Employee so removed); and
     (2) the Plan may not be amended, modified or terminated (i) at the request of a third party who has indicated an intention or taken steps to effect a Change of Control, or who effectuates a Change of Control, or (ii) in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change of Control which actually occurs, if such amendment, modification or termination would adversely affect the benefits or protections provided under the Plan to any individual who is a Covered Employee on the date such amendment, modification or termination is adopted, and in either case, any such attempted amendment, modification or termination shall be null and void ab initio as it relates to such individual. Any action taken to amend, modify or terminate the Plan that is taken after the execution of an agreement providing for a transaction or transactions that, if consummated, would constitute a Change of Control, shall conclusively be presumed to have been taken in connection with a Change of Control.
     (b) Upon and after the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Plan may not be amended or modified in any manner which would adversely affect the benefits or protections provided under the Plan to any individual who is a Covered Employee on the date the Change of Control occurred, and any such attempted amendment, modification or termination shall be null and void ab initio as it relates to such individual.
 
     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.5, if any compensation or benefit provided by the Plan may result in being subject to the tax imposed by Section 409A of the Code, the Board may modify the Plan as necessary or appropriate in the best interests of the Covered Employees (1) to exclude such compensation or benefit from being deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, or (2) to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and its related Code provisions (and the rules, regulations and other regulatory guidance relating thereto); provided, however, that no amendment made pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.5(c) shall reduce the value of the compensation or benefits that would be payable to a Covered Employee in connection with his or her Involuntary Termination following a Change of Control without the written consent of such Covered Employee.
     4.6 The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract of employment between the Employer and any person or to be consideration for the employment of any person. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer or to restrict the right of the Employer to discharge any person at any time nor shall the Plan be deemed to give the Employer the right to require any person to remain in the employ of the Employer or to restrict any person's right to terminate his or her employment at any time.
