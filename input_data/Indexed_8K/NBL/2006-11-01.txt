Exhibit 99.1
(November 1, 2006)  Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ) today reported third quarter net income of $318.1 million, or $1.80 per basic share. Excluding the previously announced after tax gain on the sale of the company's Gulf of Mexico shelf assets of approximately $88.1 million, Noble Energy's adjusted third quarter net income (a non-GAAP measure) would have been a record $230.0 million, or $1.31 per basic share (see Gulf of Mexico Shelf Asset Sale below). Third quarter 2005 net income was $177.0 million, or $1.01 per basic share.
HOUSTON
NBL
Discretionary cash flow (non-GAAP measure, see Schedule 3  Determination of Discretionary Cash Flow and Reconciliation) for the third quarter was $533.5 million, a 22 percent increase over $436.6 million for the third quarter of 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities was $406.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $385.9 million.
Average daily production for the third quarter 2006 was 187,664 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd), an increase of 11 percent compared to 168,665 Boepd for the same period last year. Sales volumes for the third quarter were 183,586 Boepd. Daily production exceeded sales volume by 4,078 Boepd because of the timing of liftings in Equatorial Guinea, the North Sea and Argentina. Production was impacted by compressor repairs following the turnaround of the Atlantic Methanol Production Company (AMPCO) methanol facility in Equatorial Guinea, which reduced natural gas sales to AMPCO by 2,385 Boepd for the quarter. The previous announced sale of the company's Gulf of Mexico shelf assets reduced third quarter 2006 production by approximately 16,000 Boepd.
In May 2006, Noble Energy announced that its board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the company's common stock. Through September 30, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares of Noble Energy common stock at an average price of $46.32 per share.
Charles D. Davidson, the company's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "Noble Energy once again reported solid operating and financial results for the quarter, reflecting our strategy of investing in a diversified portfolio of long-term, high-impact programs. Production increased over the third quarter last year, despite selling the shelf properties. Organic production increases from our three deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments and in Israel, as well as the full integration of United States Exploration, were the drivers behind our increased volumes. For the remainder of the year and continuing into 2007, we are looking forward to the results of significant exploration programs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and West Africa."
For the quarter ended September 30, 2006, realized prices for liquids and natural gas were $59.32 per barrel (Bbl) and $5.30 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), respectively. Pretax hedge losses of $43.8 million, $27.3 million after tax, lowered realized crude oil prices $7.01 per Bbl and increased realized natural gas prices approximately five cents per Mcf (see Schedule 8  Pretax Cash Flow Hedges Earnings Impact).
North America reported operating income for the third quarter of $435.4 million, which includes the pretax gain on sale of the Gulf of Mexico shelf assets of approximately $203.5 million (see Gulf of Mexico Shelf Asset Sale below). Excluding the gain on sale, North America had operating income of $231.7 million, an
 
increase of $78.4 million, or 51 percent, compared to operating income of $153.3 million for the third quarter last year.
Operations benefited from higher volumes and higher realized prices during the quarter. Third quarter production increased 21 percent to 119,872 Boepd from 99,440 Boepd for the same period last year. Production from Noble Energy's Swordfish, Ticonderoga and Lorien deepwater developments, which commenced in October 2005, February 2006 and April 2006, respectively, contributed approximately 27,000 Boepd during the third quarter of 2006.
The average realized liquids price was $56.84 per Bbl compared to $49.49 per Bbl during the third quarter of 2005. The average realized natural gas price was $6.41 per Mcf compared to $6.95 per Mcf last year.
During the third quarter, the company had 27 drilling rigs running onshore (11 in the Rocky Mountains, 11 in the Mid-continent and five in the Gulf Coast) and 46 workover rigs (26 in the Rocky Mountains, 18 in the Mid-continent and two in the Gulf Coast). Noble Energy plans to drill 817 onshore wells in 2006, of which 57 are to be drilled in the Gulf Coast, 503 are planned for the Rocky Mountains and 257 for the Mid-continent. The company also plans approximately 865 refrac, trifrac and recompletion projects for 2006, most of which will be in the Wattenberg field.
During the second quarter, the company announced two deepwater discoveries, Redrock and Raton. Located within five miles of each other in Mississippi Canyon, additional appraisal work on these discoveries is planned for the fourth quarter. Reservoir simulation and development evaluations are currently underway. In October, the Raton South appraisal well, located in Mississippi Canyon 292, was spud. The Raton South appraisal well is located in water depths of 3,200 feet and has a target depth of 20,000 feet. A Redrock appraisal well is currently under consideration for 2007. Noble Energy is the operator of both Raton and Redrock with a 50 percent working interest.
International operations reported operating income for the third quarter of $158.9 million, an increase of $0.2 million compared to $158.7 million in the third quarter last year.
International production totaled 67,793 Boepd compared to 69,225 Boepd last year. The decrease in international production was primarily attributable to compressor repairs following the turnaround and expansion project of the AMPCO methanol plant in Equatorial Guinea, which resulted in reduced natural gas sales to AMPCO of 2,385 Boepd for the quarter.
Total operating income in Equatorial Guinea increased 10 percent to $107.2 million compared to $97.2 million last year.
West Africa
Alba field condensate and natural gas sales, exclusive of the Alba Plant, LLC and methanol operations, accounted for $73.4 million, or 68 percent, of operating income from Equatorial Guinea. Alba Plant, LLC reported $30.5 million of income from liquefied petroleum gas and condensate sales, net to Noble Energy's interest, compared to $6.6 million during the third quarter 2005. The increase in operating income and sales volumes for Alba Plant, LLC reflects the completion and ramp up to full production of the Phase 2B expansion.
Income from methanol operations decreased to $3.3 million, net to Noble Energy's interest, compared to $16.2 million during the third quarter 2005, primarily because of reduced methanol production. The company's share of methanol sales volumes was 18.8 million Gal. Third quarter realized methanol prices were 83 cents per gallon (Gal).
In December, Noble Energy plans to spud the first of several exploration wells on Blocks O' and I' offshore Equatorial Guinea. To carry out the upcoming multi-well exploration program on Blocks O' and
 
I,' the company has contracted a drillship through 2007. In addition, evaluation work is underway on Block PH-77 offshore Cameroon, with the intent of identifying possible drilling locations for 2007.
In the North Sea, operating income for the third quarter of 2006 was $15.7 million compared to $24.0 million last year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower crude oil sales due to natural field decline and the timing of liftings. In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, the Dumbarton development is expected to commence production by the first quarter of 2007, with net sales volumes averaging 9,000 Boepd during 2007.
North Sea
Third quarter operating income in Israel was $24.8 million compared to $14.4 million for the same period in 2005. Natural gas production, net to Noble Energy, was the highest since sales commenced in Israel in early 2004, and averaged 116.7 MMcfpd for the third quarter 2006 compared to 81.9 MMcfpd for the same period last year. The increased natural gas production reflects the conversion to natural gas of the Reading power plant in Tel Aviv and the Eshkol power plant's natural gas turbine running as a combined-cycle base load unit. Increased seasonal demand also contributed to improved natural gas sales. The average realized price during the third quarter was 11 percent above the third quarter 2005, primarily due to a revised natural gas sales contract.
Israel
Argentina, China, Ecuador and Suriname combined recorded third quarter 2006 operating income of $11.2 million compared to $23.1 million for third quarter last year.
Argentina, China, Ecuador and Suriname
In China, third quarter operating income was $16.2 million. In Argentina, third quarter operating income was $1.6 million.
The Machala power plant reported an operating loss of $1.6 million for the third quarter, which includes a $6.9 million reserve for past due receivables. For the quarter, 182,806 megawatt-hours were produced at an average sales price of 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour.
On July 14, 2006, the company closed its Gulf of Mexico shelf asset sale to Coldren Resources LP. During the third quarter, the company recognized a pretax gain on sale of $203.5 million, $88.1 million after tax, which includes the sale to Coldren Resources and sales that have closed with preferential purchase right holders. Adjusting for the after tax gain on sale, Noble Energy's third quarter net income would have been $230.0 million, or $1.31 per basic share. This adjusted net income amount should not be considered a substitute for net income as reported in accordance with GAAP. Noble Energy is providing adjusted net income for comparison purposes to prior periods and to earnings forecasts prepared by analysts and other third parties. Management believes and certain investors may find that adjusted net income is beneficial in evaluating Noble Energy's financial performance. As of September 30, 2006, $10 million in preferential purchase rights remained to be closed.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Asset Sale
Third quarter 2006 net income excluded pretax hedge related losses of $10.1 million ($6.3 million after tax) for hedges settled during the third quarter. These losses were recognized during the second quarter 2006 in connection with the Gulf of Mexico shelf asset sale (see Schedule 8  Pretax Cash Flow Hedges Earnings Impact).
