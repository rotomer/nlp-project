     On October 31, 2007 Noble Energy, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007. A copy of the press release issued by the Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The Company's press release announcing its financial results for its fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided quantitative reconciliations within the press release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
     The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities of that Section.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
(October 31, 2007)  Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ) today reported third quarter 2007 net income of $222.7 million, or $1.30 per basic share ($1.28 per share diluted). This compares to adjusted third quarter 2006 net income (non-GAAP measure, see Note 1 below) of $230.0 million or $1.31 per basic share ($1.27 per share diluted) after adjusting for the gain on our Gulf of Mexico Shelf Asset Sale. Reported third quarter 2006 net income was $318.1 million or $1.80 per basic share ($1.75 per share diluted). Discretionary cash flow (non-GAAP measure, see Schedule 3 - Discretionary Cash Flow and Reconciliation to Operating Cash Flow) for the third quarter 2007 was $556.1 million, as compared to $533.5 million for the third quarter 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter 2007 was $547.7 million.

Key accomplishments for the third quarter include:
Third quarter 2007 results included deferred compensation expense of $8.4 million pretax ($5.3 million after tax). Excluding the effects of deferred compensation, third quarter adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure, see Note 1 below) would have been $228.0 million, or $1.33 per basic share.
Third quarter 2007 production was 214,486 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) compared to 187,664 Boepd for the same period last year. Sales volumes during the third quarter 2007 were 213,309 Boepd. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $449.1 million.
Charles D. Davidson, the company's Chairman, President and CEO, said, "Noble Energy has continued to execute its development and exploration programs resulting in another strong quarter both financially and operationally. Our exploration program experienced significant success during the quarter with announcements on the positive appraisal at Belinda and the exciting discovery of an oil column at Benita, both of which are in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, we announced a new gas condensate discovery in Cameroon. We are continuing with our West Africa exploration program now knowing that the three discoveries to-date provide a sound foundation for future growth in the region. In the U.S., we were pleased to be the apparent high bidder on several deepwater blocks at the latest Gulf of Mexico lease sale. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, our deepwater development projects made good progress and remain on schedule for delivering important new production in 2008."
North America operations reported pre-tax operating income for the third quarter 2007 of $181.3 million compared to $435.4 million for the third quarter 2006, which included a pretax gain on sale of the Gulf of Mexico Shelf assets of approximately $203.5 million.
 
North American production volumes were 107,365 Boepd in the third quarter 2007 compared to 119,872 Boepd for the same quarter last year. Liquids and natural gas production volumes were 39,992 Bopd and 404.2 MMcfpd, respectively, for the current quarter compared to 48,193 Bopd and 430.1 MMcfpd for the third quarter of 2006. As compared to the third quarter 2006, a decrease of approximately 4,000 Boepd was due to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf properties in the third quarter 2006, and a decrease of approximately 8,600 Boepd in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico resulted from a combination of well performance, workovers, storm impacts, and third-party facility restrictions. Decreases of approximately 2,500 Boepd related to natural decline in onshore Gulf Coast properties and 1,350 Boepd from our Main Pass properties were fully offset by an increase of approximately 4,050 Boepd in our remaining North America properties. Third quarter 2007 production was impacted 1,000 Boepd due to third-party processing downtime in the Rocky Mountains.
North America operations benefited from higher realized natural gas prices during the quarter. The average realized natural gas price was $6.77 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for the third quarter 2007 compared to $6.41 per Mcf last year. Realized liquids prices decreased slightly to $55.85 per barrel (Bbl) compared to $56.84 per Bbl during the third quarter of 2006. The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the major components impacting our realized natural gas and crude oil prices for the quarter.
 
International operations reported operating income for the third quarter 2007 of $231.3 million compared to $158.9 million in the third quarter last year. Total third quarter 2007 production volumes were 107,121 Boepd compared to 67,792 Boepd for the same quarter last year, an increase of 58 percent. Liquids production volumes were 45,628 barrels per day (Bpd) compared to 36,776 Bpd for the third quarter of 2006. Natural gas production was 369.0 MMcfpd compared to 186.1 MMcfpd in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2007 international sales were 105,944 Boepd, compared to 63,714 Boepd for the third quarter of 2006.
West Africa
Operating income for the third quarter increased to $112.3 million this year compared to $107.2 million last year. Total sales volumes in Equatorial Guinea (exclusive of methanol operations) were 55,813 Boepd, an increase of 90 percent compared to 29,331 Boepd during the third quarter of 2006. Higher sales volumes resulted primarily from increased natural gas sales to the LNG plant of approximately 155 MMcfpd in the quarter.
Alba field condensate and natural gas sales (exclusive of Alba Plant and methanol operations) accounted for $66.9 million, or 60 percent, of the operating income from West Africa. Third quarter 2007 condensate and natural gas sales volumes averaged 48,341 Boepd compared to 20,399 Boepd last year. The average realized price for condensate during the third quarter was $73.25 per Bbl compared to $66.93 per Bbl for the same period last year.
 
Alba Plant reported $30.7 million of income, net to Noble Energy's interest, compared to $30.5 million during the third quarter 2006. Net Alba Plant LPG and condensate sales volumes totaled 7,472 Bpd compared to 8,932 Bpd for the same period last year. The average Alba Plant realized price during the third quarter was $57.24 per Bbl compared to $48.88 per Bbl for the same period last year.
Income from methanol operations increased to $14.6 million, net to Noble Energy's interest, compared to $3.3 million during the third quarter 2006. The Company's share of methanol sales volumes was 43.5 million gallons (Gal) compared to last year's 18.8 million Gal, which was impacted by compressor repairs following a turnaround and expansion project. Third quarter realized methanol prices were 80 cents per Gal compared to 83 cents per Gal for the third quarter 2006.
North Sea
In the North Sea, operating income for the third quarter 2007 was $77.5 million compared to $15.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to increased crude sales from the Dumbarton field in the UK, which commenced production in late January 2007. In the third quarter 2007, Dumbarton production averaged approximately 13,400 Bopd.
Israel
Third quarter 2007 operating income was $28.0 million compared to $24.8 million for the same period in 2006. Natural gas production averaged a record 131.1 MMcfpd for the third quarter 2007 compared to 116.7 MMcfpd the previous year. Increased seasonal demand for natural gas contributed to the production growth. Sales prices averaged $2.95 per Mcf for the third quarter 2007 as compared to $2.84 per Mcf for the prior year period.
Other International
Argentina, China, Ecuador and Suriname combined recorded third quarter 2007 operating income of $13.6 million compared to $11.2 million for third quarter last year. In China, third quarter operating income was $12.1 million. Net oil production in China averaged 3,780 Bopd for the third quarter. In Argentina, operating income was $2.9 million, and net production averaged 2,850 Bopd. The Machala power plant reported operating income of $2.9 million. For the quarter, 223,663 megawatt-hours were sold at an average price of 7.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.
 Adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income as reported in accordance with GAAP and is provided for comparison purposes to prior periods and to earnings forecasts prepared by analysts and other third parties. Management believes and certain investors may find that adjusted net income is beneficial in evaluating the Company's financial performance.
Note 1
Fourth quarter production is expected to range from 193,000 to 197,000 Boepd, which represents an increase of six to eight percent above fourth quarter 2006. The above guidance assumes net natural gas sales to the LNG plant of 50 MMcfpd in the fourth quarter 2007 versus actual sales of 155 MMcfpd in the third quarter, with the decrease a result of fourth quarter downtime for third-party plant repairs. Compared to the third quarter 2007, other international production is expected to be down 2,000 to 5,000 Boepd mostly due to the seasonal decline in natural gas demand in Israel. Production in North America is expected to increase 1,000 to 2,000 Boepd from the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter 2007, costs and expenses are expected to range as follows:
 
For the year 2007, an effective tax rate is expected on the low end of the original estimated range of 30 to 36 percent. Of the total book taxes planned for 2007, deferred taxes are expected to be between 60 and 65 percent as compared to the previous estimate of 55 to 60 percent.
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to total approximately $1.7 billion.
