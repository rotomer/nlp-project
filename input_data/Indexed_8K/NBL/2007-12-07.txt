Amendments to Noble Energy, Inc.'s Deferred Compensation Plans.
     On December 3, 2007, and as approved by the Board of Directors of Noble Energy, Inc. (the "Company"), the Company approved the amendment and/or restatement of certain compensatory plans and arrangements in which the Company's named executive officers and/or directors participate. The principal purpose of the amendments is to comply with the recently issued final regulations under Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A").
