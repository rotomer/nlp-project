     On February 18, 2010 Noble Energy, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing results for the fiscal year and fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009. A copy of the press release issued by the Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The Company's press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal year and fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided quantitative reconciliations within the press release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
     The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities of that Section.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
(February 18, 2010)  Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ) reported today fourth quarter 2009 net income of $8 million, or $0.05 per share diluted, on revenues of $760 million. Net income for the quarter was lowered by items totaling $170 million after-tax, including unrealized commodity derivative losses and identified asset impairments, offset by the recording of recoverable deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalties. Excluding these items, which are typically not considered by analysts in published estimates, fourth quarter 2009 adjusted net income was $178 million, or $1.01 per share diluted. For the fourth quarter of 2008, net income was $305 million, or $1.72 per share diluted, on revenues of $573 million. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $163 million, or $0.91 per share diluted.

Charles D. Davidson, Noble Energy's Chairman and CEO, said, "Our results for the fourth quarter wrap up a strong year for Noble Energy. Despite reduced investment in U.S. onshore natural gas development, we were still able to grow our annual onshore volumes. We again generated free cash flow in 2009, largely attributable to our disciplined capital allocation process and diverse asset portfolio. It was perhaps the most successful exploration year in our Company's history, and we continued to build upon our large inventory of opportunities. Substantial progress was made for long-term growth, as we sanctioned the Galapagos and Aseng oil projects and signed LOIs for first sales from Tamar. As we look forward into a new decade, we are focused on maintaining our strong production base, executing on our major projects, and continuing an impactful exploration program."
Total sales volumes for the fourth quarter 2009 averaged 206 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the United States, natural gas volumes were lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to declines in the Mid-Continent region. Crude oil and condensate volumes were higher mostly due to the impact of Ticonderoga in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico returning to full production earlier in 2009. Lower oil volumes in the North Sea resulted from the FPSO repairs and facilities enhancements at Dumbarton, which have been completed. Greater natural gas volumes in West Africa were largely related to pipeline maintenance impacting the 2008 period. Natural gas volumes in Israel were reduced significantly during the fourth quarter 2009 due to warmer than normal weather and increased natural gas imports.
Crude oil price realizations for the quarter were $68.43 per barrel, up 56 percent from the fourth quarter 2008. In the U.S. and West Africa, fourth quarter 2009 crude realizations were reduced $1.71 and $4.79 per barrel, respectively, as a result of previously deferred hedge losses. U.S. natural gas prices were down from the same period in 2008, averaging $4.37 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). In Israel, natural gas prices averaged a record $4.13 per Mcf for the fourth quarter 2009. Natural gas liquid pricing in the U.S. strengthened to $38.98 per barrel for the quarter.
Cash costs, including lease operating, production and ad valorem taxes, transportation, and general and administrative expenses were $10.50 per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the quarter. Lease operating expenses were down 11 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008 to $4.80 per Boe, more than offsetting higher production taxes and transportation expenses. General and administrative expenses were up from the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily related to increased staffing for the
 
development of major projects. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization was $11.34 per Boe for the fourth quarter 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a receivable of $97 million related to the favorable resolution of royalty litigation on identified leases under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. Also included in the fourth quarter of 2009 were before-tax asset impairments of $67 million related to certain natural gas assets onshore in the U.S. and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as $100 million related to the Company's operations in Ecuador.
Year-end 2009 estimated reserves were 820 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe). Noble Energy added total proved reserves of 79 MMBoe, representing 103 percent of 2009 production, from discoveries, extensions, performance revisions and acquisitions. These reserve additions exclude negative revisions caused by lower prices and new SEC rules requiring the development of proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) within five years.
The U.S. made up 55 percent and International the remaining 45 percent of total reserve additions. Initial bookings at the Aseng oil project in West Africa accounted for the majority of the International additions. In the U.S., additions were primarily driven by the execution of low-risk development projects onshore in the Rockies, as well as from the sanctioning of the Galapagos development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
David L. Stover, President and COO of Noble Energy, said, "Our teams did a good job of organically replacing production, despite a very constrained capital program. We began converting to proved reserves the major-project resources that our exploration programs have delivered over the past few years. However, the majority of these identified resources are yet to be booked, including our discoveries at Tamar, Belinda, Gunflint and others. We anticipate substantial multi-year growth in reserves beginning in 2010."
Price revisions lowered proven reserves by 27 MMBoe driven primarily by natural gas and the use of average pricing which was lower than 2008's year-end pricing. Had the previous price methodology still been in effect, reserves would have been 61 MMBoe higher than the 2009 total.
 
Proved reserves were also reduced by 18 MMBoe as a result of the new SEC rules requiring development of PUDs within five years. These reserves are expected to be re-booked to proved as drilling occurs in future years.

Risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, without limitation, the volatility in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, the presence or recoverability of estimated reserves, the ability to replace reserves, environmental risks, drilling and operating risks, exploration and development risks, competition, government regulation or other action, the ability of management to execute its plans to meet its goals and other risks inherent in Noble Energy's business that are detailed in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends," "will," "should," "may," and similar expressions may be used to identify forward-looking statements.

The Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. Beginning with year-end reserves for 2009, the SEC permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves. We have elected not to disclose the Company's probable and possible reserves in our filings with the SEC. We use certain terms in this news release, such as "resource potential," that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures and risk factors in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, File No. 1-07964, available from Noble Energy's offices or website, http://www.nobleenergyinc.com. These forms can also be obtained from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.
