MICHAEL, BARBADOS, JUNE 3 -- Nabors Industries Ltd. (Amex: NBR) ("Nabors") today announced that its subsidiary, Nabors Industries, Inc. ("Nabors Delaware"), has priced $700 million of Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023 (the "Notes") (plus an option to the initial purchasers of the Notes to acquire up to an additional $140 million principal amount of the Notes) in a private placement transaction. The sale of the Notes is expected to close on June 10, 2003. The Notes will not bear interest and will have a zero yield to maturity. The Notes will be convertible into common shares of Nabors at a conversion price of $70.10 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. This represents a 57 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $44.65 of Nabors Industries Ltd. common shares on June 2, 2003. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity will initially be convertible into 14.265 Nabors common shares, only upon the occurrence of certain events. The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary conditions. The Notes were placed in a private transaction pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), as amended. The Notes and the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Act, and may not be offered or sold in the U.S., absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements of the Act. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. Nabors Delaware expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Notes to redeem on June 20, 2003 the remaining outstanding amount of the zero coupon convertible senior debentures due 2020 issued by Nabors Delaware. The remaining principal amount of the debentures outstanding is approximately $755 million. The Redemption Price on June 20, 2003 will be $655.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures and will be paid in cash for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $494.9 million. It is Nabors' present intention also to use the remaining proceeds of the Notes to redeem its 6.8% senior notes due April 2004 having a remaining principal amount outstanding equal to approximately $295.2 million.
