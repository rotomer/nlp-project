ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS. (c) Exhibits Exhibit No. Description ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by Nabors Industries Ltd. on July 26, 2004. ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On July 26, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2004. A copy of that release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 in accordance with General Instruction B.6 to Form 8-K. The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by the Company from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company also presented in the press release its adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities for all periods presented in the release, which is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under Regulation G. The components of adjusted (loss) income derived from operating activities are computed by using amounts which are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. As part of our press release information we have provided a reconciliation of adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities to income before income taxes, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company included its adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities in the release because management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, and because it believes this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our Company.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (NABORS INDUSTRIES LOGO) NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NABORS 2Q04 EPS $0.30 VS. $0.19 IN 2Q03 ON IMPROVED NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESS ST. MICHAEL, BARBADOS, JULY 26, 2004, NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. (AMEX: NBR), today announced its results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004. Adjusted income derived from operating activities(1) was $46.7 million for the current quarter compared to $38.0 million in the second quarter of last year and $85.1 million in the first quarter of this year. Net income was $46.3 million ($0.30 per diluted share) for the current quarter compared to $29.0 million ($0.19 per diluted share) in the prior year quarter and $71.7 million ($0.46 per diluted share) in the first quarter of this year. Operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $531.9 million in the current quarter compared to $433.9 million in the prior year quarter and $596.8 million in the first quarter of this year. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, adjusted income derived from operating activities was $131.7 million compared to $94.0 million in the first six months of 2003. Net income for the first six months of 2004 was $118.1 million ($0.76 per diluted share) compared to $77.1 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2003. Revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the first six months were $1,128.7 million compared to $889.7 million for the first six months of 2003. Gene Isenberg, Nabors' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented on the results, "I am quite pleased with the substantial year-over-year improvements in our results. This came primarily from higher utilization and pricing in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian, U.S. offshore and U.S. Land well-servicing operations." "Comparing to the sequential first quarter of 2004, we posted sizeable improvements in both our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and well-servicing businesses while results were essentially flat in our U.S. offshore and international units. Internationally, we performed relatively well despite the multiple elements of unexpected costs incurred during the quarter as previously announced. Canada was seasonally down with the spring thaw, but was substantially improved over the same period of 2003 with higher rig utilization and pricing reflecting the continuing strength in that market. Alaska was down as we anticipated with the windup of the winter exploration activity and a generally weak market. Oil and gas and other operating income was down but in line with our revised expectations which included $2.1 million in dry hole expense." - -------- (1) Adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading "Segment Reporting."
"Our outlook for the balance of the year continues to be quite positive as all of our businesses except Alaska anticipate improved results in the second half. We expect the largest improvement to come from our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling unit where higher rig activity and pricing combined with reduced expenses related to rig mobilizations and start-ups should generate increasingly higher results. Our international business should post the next most meaningful improvement with the unusual costs of the second quarter mostly behind us, and anticipated increases in rig activity and average per rig margins. Our U.S. offshore unit's results should also show significant improvement over the balance of the year with the contribution of two new MODS deepwater platform rigs which commenced late in the second quarter. Likewise, U.S. Land well servicing should benefit from continuing high activity levels and the contribution of recent pricing improvements. Canada is rapidly emerging from its second quarter seasonal trough with a much higher rig count and stronger rates, which should make the second half equal to or slightly better than first half. "With each quarter we continue to see constructive trends in place that support our belief that the North American gas markets will require higher levels of drilling for an extended period to meet the supply challenges. While there is some degree of uncertainty as to the precise magnitude and timing of incremental rig pricing and utilization, we are very confident of our strategy over the long-term in both our North American and international markets. Our international business continues to demonstrate high potential with increasing activity both currently and prospectively, particularly in the Middle East and North African regions." The Nabors companies own and operate almost 600 land drilling and approximately 950 land workover and well-servicing rigs worldwide. Offshore, Nabors operates 45 platform rigs, 19 jack-up units, and three barge rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Nabors markets 31 marine transportation and support vessels, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Nabors manufactures top drives and drilling instrumentation systems and provides comprehensive oilfield hauling, engineering, civil construction, logistics and facilities maintenance, and project management services. Nabors participates in most of the significant oil, gas and geothermal markets in the world.

NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED) (1) See "Computation of Earnings Per Share" included herein as a separate schedule. (2) Adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading "Segment Reporting".
NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)
NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES SEGMENT REPORTING (UNAUDITED) The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity: (1) These segments include our drilling, workover and well-servicing operations, on land and offshore. (2) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and March 31, 2004, respectively, and $2.2 million and $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (3) Represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. (4) Includes our marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations.
(5) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $.1 million, $.4 million and $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and March 31, 2004, respectively, and $2.8 million and $5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (6) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions. (7) Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading "Segment Reporting". (8) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses. (9) Excludes well-servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Rig years represents a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365-day period represents 0.5 rig years. (10) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates which totaled 4.0 years during each of the three month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, and March 31, 2004 and 8.0 years for each of the six month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. (11) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well-servicing rig fleet operated during the period. NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE (UNAUDITED) A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations is as follows: (1) Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2003 reflects the assumed conversion of our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures, as the conversion in the period would have been dilutive. For the three months ended June 30, 2003, the weighted-average number of shares oustanding-diluted excludes 7.2 million potentially dilutive shares issuable upon the conversion of our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures because the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive, given the level of net income for that quarter. We redeemed for cash the remaining outstanding principal amount of our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures on June 20, 2003 and therefore these debentures did not impact the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 or the three months ended March 31, 2004.
(2) Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and the three months ended March 31, 2004 reflects the assumed conversion of our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures, as the conversion in those periods would have been dilutive. For the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and the six months ended June 30, 2003, the weighted-average number of shares outstanding-diluted excluded 8.5 million potentially dilutive shares issuable upon the conversion of our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures because the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive, given the level of net income for that period. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and the six months ended June 30, 2003 excluded the related add-back of interest expense, net of tax, of $3.1 million, $3.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, for these debentures. These shares would have been dilutive and therefore included in the calculation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding-diluted had diluted earnings per share been at or above $.37, $.36 and $.71 for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and six months ended June 30, 2003, respectively. (3) Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and March 31, 2004 and the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 excludes approximately 10.0 million potentially dilutive shares initially issuable upon the exchange of our $700 million zero coupon exchangeable senior notes due 2023. Such shares are contingently exchangeable under certain circumstances and would only be included in the calculation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding-diluted if any of those criteria were met. Such criteria were not met during the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 and March 31, 2004 and the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. Based on the initial exchange price per share, these notes would be exchangeable for our common shares if the closing sale price per share of Nabors' common shares for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $84.12 for all calendar quarters ending on or before June 30, 2008, and $77.11 for all calendar quarters thereafter. (4) Includes the following weighted-average number of common shares of Nabors and weighted-average number of exchangeable shares of Nabors Exchangeco, respectively: 148.6 million and .3 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2004; 145.9 million and .5 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2003; 147.6 million and .4 million shares for the three months ended March 31, 2004; 148.1 million and .3 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2004; and 145.5 million and .5 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2003. The exchangeable shares of Nabors Exchangeco are exchangeable for Nabors common shares on a one-for-one basis, and have essentially identical rights as Nabors Industries Ltd. common shares, including but not limited to voting rights and the right to receive dividends, if any.
