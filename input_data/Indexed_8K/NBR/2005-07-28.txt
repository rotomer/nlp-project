ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On July 27, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2005. A copy of that release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 in accordance with General Instruction B.2 to Form 8-K. The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by the Company from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company also presented in the press release its adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities for all periods presented in the release, which is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under Regulation G. The components of adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities are computed by using amounts which are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. As part of our press release information we have provided a reconciliation of adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities to income before income taxes, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company included its adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities in the release because management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, and because it believes this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our Company.

EXHIBIT 99.1 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (NABORS INDUSTRIES LOGO) NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NABORS' $0.82 - 2Q05 EPS SETS RECORD 2Q04 WAS $0.30 HAMILTON, BERMUDA, JULY 27, 2005, NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. (AMEX: NBR), today announced record results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005. Adjusted income derived from operating activities(1) was $173.8 million for the current quarter compared to $46.7 million in the second quarter of last year and $171.9 million in the first quarter of this year. Net income was $131.8 million ($0.82 per diluted share) for the current quarter compared to $46.3 million ($0.30 per diluted share) in the second quarter of last year and $127.4 million ($0.80 per diluted share) in the first quarter of this year. Operating revenues and Earnings from Unconsolidated Affiliates totaled $770.5 million in the current quarter compared to $531.9 million in the second quarter of last year and $785.7 million in the first quarter of this year. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, adjusted income derived from operating activities was $345.8 million compared to $131.7 million in the first six months of 2004. Net income for the first six months of 2005 was $259.2 million ($1.62 per diluted share) compared to $118.1 million ($0.76 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2004. Revenues and Earnings from Unconsolidated Affiliates for the first six months of 2005 rose to $1.6 billion, up from $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2004. Gene Isenberg, Nabors' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The remarkable potency of our markets is illustrated by the magnitude of the sequential increase in our operating numbers achieved despite the $47 million seasonal drop in Canada's results. The largest improvement came from our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operation, which realized a larger than expected increase in average per rig day margins and added seven rigs. The next most significant improvement came from our U.S. Land Well-Servicing unit where pricing continued to move up in response to a tight supply/demand dynamic. Our U.S. Offshore unit also posted a substantial increase with improved pricing, slightly higher utilization and the final settlement of our business interruption claim that stemmed from the loss of platform rig P-141 during hurricane Ivan last fall. Our International unit posted solid improvement on higher activity, as did our Oil and Gas operations. Our manufacturing and construction businesses (Other Operating Segments) also realized a substantial increase, primarily as a result of a good construction season in Alaska, higher directional drilling activity and pricing for Ryan, and improving results in Marine transportation. Alaska drilling was better than expected although seasonally lower than the first quarter. "Our financial position continues to get even stronger with an excellent balance sheet that includes net debt at 12 percent. Strong cash flow is funding virtually all of our programs including this quarter's repurchase of - ------------------------- (1) Adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading "Segment Reporting."
$80.6 million in stock (1.5 million shares at an average cost of $53.73 per share) and an accelerated capital spending program that is likely to exceed $1 billion this year. "The outlook for our business has never been stronger, with rig demand showing no signs of abating in both North America and internationally. Consequently, we are accelerating our construction program to address the need for faster moving and more efficient rigs. Since mid-2000 our global operations have deployed approximately 200 rigs, many of which were substantially upgraded with the latest in pipe handling systems, larger horsepower pumps, and electronically controlled, higher horsepower engines, and reconfigured to facilitate more efficient moves. Over 100 of these rigs have been completed and deployed in the last 18 months, and our assessment of demand indicates there is a possibility that Nabors will realize opportunities to deploy another 100 over the next 24 months. We will continue to require term-contracts with each new rig virtually assuring good returns and more importantly, allowing the customers to determine the pace of capacity additions. "Our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operation has seen the largest number of rig additions and is currently preparing 10 more for service, three of which will be essentially new PACE rigs like the one deployed in the Rockies during the quarter. Shell attested to the quality and performance of these rigs when they named one of the two pad drilling rigs they employ in the Pinedale Anticline as their "Land Rig of the Year," a selection based upon superior safety and operational performance when compared to all of the land rigs Shell contracts worldwide. On June 30th we completed the acquisition of the assets of Alexander Drilling, which consisted of 8 rigs and 5 air drilling packages and an operating base. The rigs range from 500 to 750 horsepower. Alexander was a well regarded contractor and this acquisition significantly increases our share of the Arkoma air drilling market. Our U.S. Land Well-Servicing unit is currently taking delivery of the first of 40 new PLC (Programmable Logic Controlled), 500 HP Millennium workover rigs which will be placed in service over the next 18 months. The positive reaction of our customers to the performance of the first such unit, deployed one year ago, has exceeded our expectations and led to commitments for these rigs well ahead of the delivery schedule. "In Canada we have fifteen rigs under construction for use in that market along with another 10 A/C coiled tubing/stem drilling rigs. In our U.S. Offshore business we recently completed construction of Sundowner XIX, which is currently deploying to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The success of our deep shelf drilling barge 300, which was completed one year ago, has resulted in our decision to proceed with construction of posted barge rig 301, which will be a PACE rig with broader application than rig 300 with the same deep shelf drilling capability. "Internationally, our second Sundowner platform workover rig commenced operations on a long-term contract offshore India during the quarter. A number of high value new contracts were signed during the quarter, including two 3,000 HP A/C rigs which are finishing construction in Dubai and are expected to commence drilling for the Luksar joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by early first quarter. We also executed contracts for two new 1,000 HP high spec rigs for the Sincor venture in Venezuela, both of which should commence in the fourth quarter, and a multi-year contact for the Dolphin 110 Jackup workover rig, which will be upgraded and redeployed from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Angola. Internationally, we are also constructing the fourth unit of our unique MODS rigs (MODS 151) for a term-contract for Shell offshore Australia that should also commence around the end of this year. There are also numerous proposals pending internationally which should materialize in the near future and which, if successful, would result in another 10-15 long-term rig contracts. "The strength of the current market environment and the inability of the industry to satisfy demand over the foreseeable future is placing a premium on existing rigs. As a result prices are rising rapidly, particularly in the U.S. Lower 48. We are entering into an increasing number of long-term contracts for existing rigs at margins that are more than 25% above those achieved this quarter. Similarly, global market demand is also placing a
premium on newer, more efficient rigs that can be delivered both expeditiously and in quantity in a multitude of venues. This gives Nabors' a substantial competitive advantage given our unique access to a global suite of customers, our worldwide infrastructure and the unparalleled volume and strength of our procurement relationships." The Nabors companies own and operate almost 600 land drilling and approximately 875 land workover and well-servicing rigs worldwide. Offshore, Nabors operates 43 platform rigs, 19 jack-up units and three barge rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Nabors markets 28 marine transportation and supply vessels, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Nabors manufactures top drives and drilling instrumentation systems and provides comprehensive oilfield hauling, engineering, civil construction, logistics and facilities maintenance, and project management services. Nabors participates in most of the significant oil, gas and geothermal markets in the world.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by Nabors from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED) (1) See "Computation of Earnings Per Share" included herein as a separate schedule. (2) Adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading "Segment Reporting". 1-1
NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED) 1-2
NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES SEGMENT REPORTING (UNAUDITED) The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity: (1) These segments include our drilling, workover and well-servicing operations, on land and offshore. (2) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $1.2 million, $1.1 million 1-3
and $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and March 31, 2005, respectively, and $1.9 million and $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (3) Represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. (4) Includes our marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. (5) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $4.0 million, $.1 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and March 31, 2005, respectively, and $5.3 million and $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (6) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions. (7) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses. (8) Excludes well-servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represents a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365-day period represents 0.5 rig years. (9) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates which totaled 4.0 years during the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and 3.7 years during the three months ended March 31, 2005, and 3.9 years and 4.0 years during the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (10) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well-servicing rig fleet operated during the period. 1-4
NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE (UNAUDITED) A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations is as follows: (1) Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and March 31, 2005 and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 excludes approximately 8.5 million potentially dilutive shares initially issuable upon the conversion of these debentures. Such shares did not impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and March 31, 2005, and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as we are required to pay cash up to the principal amount of any debentures converted resulting from the issuance of a supplemental indenture relating to the debentures in October 2004. We would only issue an incremental number of shares upon conversion of these debentures, and such shares would only be included in the calculation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in our diluted earnings per share calculation, if the price of our shares exceeded approximately $96. Such shares did not impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2004 because the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive, given the level of net income for that period. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2004 excludes the related add-back of interest expense, net of tax, of $3.1 million for these debentures. These shares would have been dilutive and therefore included in the calculation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding-diluted had diluted earnings per share been at or above $.37 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2004 reflects the assumed conversion of our 1-5
$1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures due 2021, as the conversion in that period would have been dilutive. (2) Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and March 31, 2005 and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 excludes approximately 10.0 million potentially dilutive shares initially issuable upon the exchange of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due 2023. Such shares did not impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2005, and March 31, 2005, and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as we are required to pay cash up to the principal amount of any notes exchanged as a result of the supplemental indenture issued for these notes during the fourth quarter of 2004. We would only issue an incremental number of shares upon exchange of these notes, and such shares would only be included in the calculation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in our diluted earnings per share calculation, if the price of our shares exceeded $70.10. Such shares did not impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 as the notes are contingently exchangeable under certain circumstances and would only be included in the calculation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding-diluted if any of those criteria were met. Such criteria were not met during the three and six months ended June 30, 2004. Based on the initial exchange price per share, these notes would have been exchangeable for our common shares during those periods if the closing sale price per share of Nabors' common shares for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter was greater than or equal to $84.12. (3) Includes the following weighted-average number of common shares of Nabors and weighted-average number of exchangeable shares of Nabors Exchangeco (Canada) Inc., an indirect wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary of Nabors, respectively: 157.2 million and .2 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2005; 148.6 million and .3 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2004; 152.0 million and .2 million shares for the three months ended March 31, 2005; 154.6 million and .2 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2005; and 148.1 million and .3 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The exchangeable shares of Nabors Exchangeco are exchangeable for Nabors common shares on a one-for-one basis, and have essentially identical rights as Nabors Industries Ltd. common shares, including but not limited to voting rights and the right to receive dividends, if any. 1-6
