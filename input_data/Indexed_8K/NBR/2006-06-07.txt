Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 5, 2006, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc. (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers") exercised their option to purchase an additional $250,000,000 of the 0.94% Senior Exchangeable Notes due 2011 (the "Additional Notes") of Nabors Industries Inc. ("NII") pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated May 18, 2006, among Nabors Industries Ltd. ("Nabors"), NII and the Initial Purchasers. The Additional Notes increase the aggregate issuance by NII of 0.94% Senior Exchangeable Notes due 2011 to $2,750,000,000. The Additional Notes are exchangeable under certain conditions for Nabors' common shares as previously disclosed. Such additional Notes are expected to be issued on June 8, 2006.
In connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes, NII will amend the exchangeable note hedge transactions entered into with Citibank, N.A. and Bear, Stearns International Inc. (the "Dealers") at the initial closing under the Purchase Agreement with respect to Nabors' common shares to cover the additional net Nabors' common shares that would be deliverable to exchanging noteholders in the event of an exchange of the Additional Notes, and Nabors will enter into an amendment of its separate warrant transactions entered into with the Dealers at the initial closing under the Purchase Agreement to increase the number of warrants sold to acquire Nabors' common shares. NII will pay the Dealers an additional amount of approximately $53 million in connection with the amendment to the note hedge transactions and Nabors will receive from the Dealers an additional amount of approximately $38.3 million in connection with the amendment to the warrant transactions.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 31, 2006, Nabors International Finance Inc. ("NIFI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nabors, received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") two Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") in connection with an audit of NIFI for tax years 2002 and 2003. One NOPA proposes to deny a deduction of $85,131,507 in interest expense in our 2002 tax year relating to intercompany indebtedness created in connection with our inversion transaction in June 2002 whereby we were reorganized as a Bermuda company. The second proposes to deny a deduction of $207,616,079 in the same item of interest expense in our 2003 tax year. We previously had obtained advice from our tax advisors that the deduction of such amounts was appropriate and more recently that the position of the IRS lacks merit. We do not presently intend to take any reserves in our financial statements in connection with the NOPAs and intend to contest the IRS position vigorously. The Company in December 2003 paid approximately one-half of the intercompany indebtedness created in connection with the inversion. There can be no assurance that our position will prevail or that we may not be required to pay material amounts of additional tax, together with interest, related to the IRS position in the NOPAs.
In a press release issued on June 7, 2006, NII announced that on June 5, 2006 the Initial Purchasers notified the Company that they were exercising their option to purchase the full $250,000,000 of
 
additional 0.94% Senior Exchangeable Notes due 2011 (the "Additional Notes") of Nabors Industries Inc. ("NII") pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated May 18, 2006, among Nabors, NII and the Initial Purchasers. Nabors expects to complete the sale of Additional Notes pursuant to such option on June 8, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
HAMILTON, Bermuda(BUSINESS WIRE)June 7, 2006Nabors Industries Ltd. (NYSE: NBR) today announced that the initial purchasers of senior exchangeable notes due 2011 (the "Notes") of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nabors Industries, Inc. ("NII") notified Nabors that they were exercising in full their right pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated May 18, 2006, among Nabors, NII and the initial purchasers, to purchase an additional $250 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes (the "Additional Notes") to cover over-allotments in the initial private offering. The closing of the offering of the Additional Notes is expected to occur on June 8, 2006.
The Additional Notes are being offered on the same terms as the initial closing, including increases to the size of the exchangeable note hedge transactions and the separate warrant transactions, effectively increasing the exchange price of the Notes from approximately $45.83 under the terms of the Notes to $54.64 per share of Nabors' Common Shares from the perspective of Nabors, representing a 55% premium based on the last reported sales price on the New York Stock Exchange of $35.25 per share on May 17, 2006, the date of pricing, and a 66.8% premium over the last reported sales price of $32.75 today, June 7, 2006. On a consolidated basis, Nabors will pay approximately $15.0 million in connection with the amendment to the note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, providing net proceeds to Nabors on a consolidated basis of approximately $233 million.
NII intends to use the proceeds of the issuance of Additional Notes net of the additional cost of the note hedge transactions for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, retirement of other indebtedness, repurchases of Nabors' common shares or pursuing acquisition opportunities.
