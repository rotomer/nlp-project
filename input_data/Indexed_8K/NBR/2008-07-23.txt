Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On July 17, 2008, Nabors Industries, Inc. (the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nabors Industries Ltd. ("Nabors"), and Nabors entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") under which the Company agreed to sell $400 million additional aggregate principal amount of its 6.15% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes") to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"). The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors. A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Purchase Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
     The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on July 22, 2008. The Company sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
     The Notes are governed by and are issued as additional debt securities under an indenture, dated as of February 20, 2008 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, as issuer, Nabors, as guarantor, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") pursuant to which the Company issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.15% Senior Notes due 2018 on February 20, 2008. A copy of the Indenture was previously filed as Exhibit 4.2 to Form 8-K filed on February 25, 2008, and is incorporated herein by reference; the descriptions of the Indenture and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture and Notes, respectively.
     In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on July 22, 2008, the Company, Nabors and the Initial Purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") requiring the Company and Nabors to file a registration statement with the SEC to register an offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms, within 50 days. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
     The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 6.15% per year payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2008. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2018. The Notes were issued at an offering price of 97.192%, plus interest accrued from February 20, 2008.
     In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes), the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the Company at a redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as specified in the Indenture.
 
     
 
     The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness. Nabors' guarantee of the Notes will be unsecured and will rank equal in right of payment to all of Nabors' unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
     The Company received net proceeds, before expenses, of $397,354,667 from the sale of the Notes on July 22, 2008.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On July 22, 2008, (the Company) issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2008. A copy of that release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 in accordance with General Instruction B.2 to Form 8-K.
     The press release furnished as an exhibit to this report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by the Company from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.
     The Company also presented in the press release "non-GAAP" financial measures under Regulation G. The Company presented its adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities for all periods presented in the release. The components of adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities are computed by using amounts which are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. As part of our press release information we have provided a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities to income before income taxes, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure.
     The Company included its adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities in the release because management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, and because it believes this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of the Company. The Company included the adjusted net income number because management believes the non-GAAP financial measure to be more indicative of the Company's on-going operating results and financial condition.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an OffBalance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On July 22, 2008, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.
     Additional terms and conditions are contained in Item 1.01 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events
     As part of its above-mentioned press release issued on July 22, 2008, Nabors announced completion of the placement by its wholly owned subsidiary, the Company, of $400 million additional aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2018. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed.

Indemnity and Contribution
 
only information furnished by any such Initial Purchaser consists of the information described in Section 8(b);
     (b) Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers, the Guarantor, its directors, its officers and each other person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to the Initial Purchasers, but only with reference to information relating to the Initial Purchasers furnished in writing by the Initial Purchasers to the Company expressly for use in the Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package or the Final Memorandum or any amendments or supplements thereto, it being understood and agreed that the only information furnished by any such Initial Purchaser consists of the following information in the Offering Memorandum: the eighth (first sentence only) and ninth paragraphs under the caption "Plan of Distribution.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Initial Purchasers, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Guarantor, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the Offering Memorandum or herein, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor or by the Initial Purchasers, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company, the Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes resold by it in the initial placement of such Notes were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages
pro rata
 
that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes they have agreed to purchase hereunder and not joint.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or the Guarantor contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or any person controlling any Initial Purchaser or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors, the Guarantor, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company or the Guarantor and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
     9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Initial Purchasers to the Company and the Guarantor, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or settlement of trading shall have been materially disrupted, (ii) trading of any securities of the Guarantor shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities (including without limitation an act of terrorism) or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse to the financial markets generally and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 9(a)(i) through 9(a)(iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Offering Memorandum.
Termination
     10. . If any one or more Initial Purchasers shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Initial Purchaser hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions that the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule A hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Initial Purchasers) the Notes that the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule A hereto, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such nondefaulting Initial Purchasers do not purchase all the Notes, this Agreement will
Default by an Initial Purchaser
 
terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser or the Company. In the event of a default by any Initial Purchaser as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Initial Purchasers shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
     11. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Expense Reimbursement
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Initial Purchasers because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company or the Guarantor shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel up to a maximum of $100,000), reasonably incurred by the Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

          (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning
 
of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Holder, but only with reference to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities which are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to a Holder furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
          (c) Each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to the Initial Purchasers, but only with reference to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities which are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to the Initial Purchasers furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by the Initial Purchasers expressly for use in any Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Initial Purchasers may otherwise have.
          (d) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the three preceding paragraphs, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person or Persons against whom such indemnity may be sought (each an "Indemnifying Person") in writing, and such Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnifying Person shall be able to participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it so elects, jointly with any other similarly situated Indemnifying Person, to assume the defense thereof, subject to the right of the Indemnified Person to be separately represented and to direct its own defense if the named parties to any such proceeding include both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person has been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) such Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnifying Person and an Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that an
 
Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Indemnified Holders shall be designated in writing by the Holders of the majority in amount of Securities and New Securities offered in the Prospectus to which the claim relates, any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, respective officers and such control Persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company, and any such separate firm for the Guarantor, its directors, respective officers and such control Persons of the Guarantor shall be designated in writing by the Guarantor. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, such Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in the first, second and third paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other hand pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or from the offering of the Securities or New Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and any Indemnified Holder on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement received by the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total net proceeds received by such Indemnified Holder from sales of Securities or New Securities giving rise to such obligations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or such Indemnified Holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
          (f) Each of the Company, the Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall any Holder of any Securities or New Securities be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Security or New Security pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holder would have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro
rata
          (g) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
          (h) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or any Person controlling any Holder or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, their respective officers or directors or any other Person controlling any of the Company or the Guarantor and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities or New Securities.

Hamilton, Bermuda, July 22, 2008 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ Nabors Industries Ltd. (NYSE: NBR)
"Our second quarter saw a dramatic and rapid turnaround in activity and in the outlook for our North American businesses," said Gene Isenberg, Nabors Chairman and CEO, "although non-operational items obscured bottom line results. It is now clear that our operating income bottomed out in the second quarter and the outlook for the second half and beyond is improving more rapidly than we had anticipated.
"The quarter's net income and per share results were reduced by approximately six cents per diluted share as a result of an adjustment to our full year estimated taxes ($0.03), an accounting rules dictated increase in diluted shares ($0.01), and the non-cash mark-to-market loss on certain forward hedges in our First Reserve E&P joint venture entities ($0.02).
"Operationally, we achieved improving sequential results in every significant business unit except for Canada and Alaska, which were down seasonally although less than anticipated. The most significant evidence of the turn around in our businesses is demonstrated by more than 20 term contract commitments for additional new-built rigs that we received since last quarter, the preponderance of which were secured by our US Lower 48 Land Drilling unit. There are also a large number of additional term commitments pending. We have recently placed an order with National Oilwell Varco for a number of their Rapid Rigs, which we feel are ideally suited for the shallower shale plays that are increasingly active.
"In our US Lower 48 Land Drilling unit we have seen the working rig count increase by 31 rigs over our first quarter average. Our US Lower 48 rig count now stands at 257 rigs after averaging 242.3 rigs in the second quarter and to 225.7 in the first quarter. Our second quarter average margins were essentially flat sequentially at $8,900 per rig day. This is a combination of lower but higher than expected margins on renewing term contracts, offset by idle rigs returning to work at improving rates and the attainment of full margins on our 75
 
new rigs deployed to date. Our new PACE rigs continue to set records in virtually every area in which they operate and the magnitude of this quarter's new build commitments and the higher rates they are commanding substantiates their value.
"Our US Offshore operations experienced a very good quarter as income rebounded sharply from the lackluster first quarter. This primarily was due to more consistent utilization of our jackups and $1.6 million (pre-tax) in business interruption insurance associated with the Barge Rig 100 fire last summer. Rates and activity are improving and it appears that the current strong environment will continue for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to see the substantial slowdown in third quarter activity that has characterized the last two hurricane seasons. Rather we are seeing opportunities for additional rigs and interest is increasing for longer-term contract commitments.
"Although our US Well Servicing unit is not doing well, we still posted a slightly improved quarter on higher hours. This market is improving and we have recently instituted price increases in most regions in which we operate. We are regaining market share in certain markets where price competition has been acute and we expect further gains over the next two quarters. Customer recognition of the inherent advantages of the new technology that is incorporated in our Millennium rigs is increasing broadly. We will take delivery of 10 of the 400 horsepower version of these Millennium rigs during the second half of this year, with potential for another 90 thereafter.
"Our International unit posted a significant sequential improvement and expects to achieve much larger sequential increases over the next two quarters. The quarter was aided by $3.9 million (pre-tax) in business interruption insurance for one of our small jackups that incurred flooding damage during mobilization last fall. The largest increase will come from the full impact of our new jackup rig 660, which incurred delays and start up issues which hurt its second quarter contribution. This is followed by the start-up of jackup rig 657 in early July and the full contribution of four other land rigs that commenced in the first half, all of which also had some delays that impacted the second quarter. All of these rigs are now operating satisfactorily and contributing as expected. Six other land rigs are set to commence operations during the third quarter, with potentially as many as 13 other rigs in the fourth quarter. The international outlook remains strong in virtually every region and new rig possibilities continue to materialize. We still anticipate an increase in operating income of approximately 40% over 2007's results.
"Alaska was down slightly as the winter exploration season wound down early in the quarter. This market is seeing healthy increases in activity and rates both in and away from the established producing fields on the North Slope and in the Cook Inlet. We expect to see a large increase in income contribution over the next two years, albeit from a small base as several incremental development projects commence and exploration activity increases. Results will be bolstered by two new built Heli-portable rigs which commenced operations near the start of 2008, and by two legacy rigs which are receiving standby revenue while being upgraded and refurbished for long term contracts. Our new Coiled Tubing/Stem drilling rig, which is the only such rig capable of drilling to 15,000 feet, will commence operations in early 2009 and we have two proposals pending for additional multi-year contracts.
"As anticipated, Canada experienced the worst quarter in its history during this year's spring thaw, although it was modestly better than we had expected. The outlook has improved substantially over the last two months, although it is still too early to be definitive regarding the timing and extent of the recovery. To date the third quarter has been plagued by wetter than normal weather, with approximately 30 rigs currently waiting to commence contracts. The extent of future activity in Alberta is still dependant upon modifications to the provincial royalty increases there which are set to commence in 2009 and which have driven several operators to deploy capital elsewhere. Meanwhile, in British Columbia we are seeing rapidly accelerating activity, particularly in the new shale plays of Horn River and Montney. We have a large number of both new and
 
legacy rig commitments for these and other emerging shale plays in other areas of Canada and we are currently negotiating commitments for several more. We will also soon deploy one of our new Heli-portable rigs for what looks to be year-around work in Horn River, where no roads currently exist and where access has heretofore been limited to winter only.
"Our Other Operating Segments posted a very good quarter and continues to enjoy a very strong outlook. The primary contributor to this unit's performance was our Canrig entity where sales are increasing significantly, particularly to third parties. Our instrumentation and data management entity and our directional drilling unit also posted very good results despite the seasonally weak Canadian market. Our 50% owned Alaskan construction and logistics joint ventures contributed less significantly due to the customary spring quarter drop off in activity and income.
"I remain very pleased with the performance of our oil and gas entities, although operating income results will not be evident until the latter part of the year. Even though we have experienced accounting losses associated with the commodity price hedges we have in place, they are providing us with exactly what we envisioned, that being higher than expected returns while substantially eliminating downside risk. We continue to find very attractive investment opportunities and we have acreage holdings in most of the emerging North American shale plays. Not only is this business poised to contribute significantly in the near future, it is providing us with valuable insight to better target our rig marketing activities.
"Earlier today, we closed on the issuance, through a wholly owned subsidiary, an additional $400 million of our 6.15% Senior Notes due 2018. The notes were issued at an offering price of 97.192%, plus accrued interest from February 20, 2008. This was an additional placement of the $575 million in notes we issued in February of this year. This brings to $975 million the aggregate total of these notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nabors Industries Ltd. These notes will provide financing for what we think will be a large and profitable investment program for new built rigs and other attractive capital expenditures.
"Our expectations for 2009 are increasing although we will be subject to a recent non-cash, non-operational, accounting rule change regarding convertible debt which will effect our net income and earnings per share starting with the beginning of 2009. This rule will require us to record non-cash interest expense on our 0.94% coupon convertible debt due 2011 in an amount equal to the extent that the actual coupon represents a discount to our estimated borrowing rate for conventional debt at the time the convertible notes were issued. We will also be required to restate three years of results for any convertible issues that were outstanding during that period. The offsetting entry will be to treat the lower coupon as a debt discount on our balance sheet and to accrete the value of the debt as the non-cash interest expense is recorded. This change will have no effect on the real economic results of our business but will obviously affect our reported GAAP earnings.
"I remain convinced of the strength of the North American gas markets, short-term volatility notwithstanding. Gas remains the most attractive fuel and there is minimal likelihood that LNG will be a negative price factor in these markets for the foreseeable future. This puts Nabors in an advantageous position to prosper going forward across all of our North American business lines and, when coupled with the ongoing strength and growing market share we enjoy internationally, promises a very bright future."
The Nabors companies own and operate approximately 548 land drilling and approximately 749 land workover and well-servicing rigs in North America.
