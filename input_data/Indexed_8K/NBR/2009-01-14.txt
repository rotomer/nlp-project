Morgan Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers").

     The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on January 12, 2009. Nabors sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. Nabors relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
     The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of January 12, 2009 (the "Indenture"), among Nabors, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). A copy of the Indenture is included in this Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.2, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the Indenture and the Notes should be read in their entirety for a complete description of their provisions and the summaries in this report are qualified in their entirety by the text of such provisions.
     In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on January 12, 2009, Nabors, the Company and the Initial Purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") requiring Nabors and the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC to register an offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms, by July 12, 2009. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is included in this Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.3, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; it should be read in its entirety for a complete description of its provisions and the summary in this report is qualified in its entirety by the text of such provisions.
     The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 9.25% per year payable semiannually in arrears in cash on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2019.
     In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes), the holders of the Notes may require Nabors to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the
 
option of Nabors at a redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as specified in the Indenture.
     The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of Nabors' other existing and future senior unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of Nabors' existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness. The Company's guarantee of the Notes will be unsecured and will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
     Nabors received net proceeds, before expenses, of approximately $1.1 billion from the sale of the Notes on January 12, 2009.

     (b) Each Initial Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Company and, for the purposes of the opinions to be delivered to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Sections 5(c), 5(d), 5(e) and 5(f), counsel for the Company, counsel for the Guarantor and counsel for the Initial Purchasers, respectively, may rely upon the accuracy of the representations and warranties of such Initial Purchaser, and compliance of such Initial Purchaser with its agreements, contained in paragraph 7(a) above, and such Initial Purchaser hereby consents to such reliance.
     8. . (a) The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, the respective officers and directors of the Initial Purchasers, and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package, the Final Memorandum, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by the Initial Purchasers expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only information furnished by any such Initial Purchaser consists of the information described in Section 8(b);
Indemnity and Contribution
     (b) Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers, the Guarantor, its directors, its
 
officers and each other person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to the Initial Purchasers, but only with reference to information relating to the Initial Purchasers furnished in writing by the Initial Purchasers to the Company expressly for use in the Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package or the Final Memorandum or any amendments or supplements thereto, it being understood and agreed that the only information furnished by any such Initial Purchaser consists of the following information in the Offering Memorandum: the ninth (first sentence only) and tenth paragraphs under the caption "Plan of Distribution."
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding; but the omission so to promptly notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection provided that the party entitled to be so notified is not prejudiced by such delay to promptly notify. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Initial Purchasers, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Guarantor, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding, and (ii) does not include an admission of fault, culpability or a culpable failure to act, by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the Offering Memorandum or herein, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor or by the Initial Purchasers, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company, the Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes resold by it in the initial placement of such Notes were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages
pro rata
 
that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes they have agreed to purchase hereunder and not joint.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or the Guarantor contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or any person controlling any Initial Purchaser or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors, the Guarantor, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company or the Guarantor and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
     9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Initial Purchasers to the Company and the Guarantor, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, either the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or settlement of trading shall have been materially disrupted, (ii) trading of any securities of the Guarantor shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities (including without limitation an act of terrorism) or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse to the financial markets generally and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 9(a)(i) through 9(a)(iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Offering Memorandum.
Termination
     10. . If any one or more Initial Purchasers shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Initial Purchaser hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions that the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule A hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Initial Purchasers) the Notes that the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes that the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule A hereto, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such nondefaulting Initial Purchasers do not purchase all the Notes, this Agreement will
Default by an Initial Purchaser
 
terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser or the Company. In the event of a default by any Initial Purchaser as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five business days, as the Initial Purchasers shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
     11.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Expense Reimbursement.
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Initial Purchasers because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company or the Guarantor shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel up to a maximum of $100,000) reasonably incurred by the Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     12. . Notices given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered (a) if to the Company, at 515 W. Greens Road, Suite 1200, Houston, Texas 77067, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or (b) if to the Guarantor, Mintflower Place, 8 Par-La-Ville Road, Hamilton, HM08, Bermuda, or (c) if to the Initial Purchasers, to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at its offices at 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, or in any case to such other address as the person to be notified may have requested in writing.

     SECTION 3.08. . Unless otherwise required by Bermudan law, neither the Company nor the Guarantor will deduct or withhold from payments made with respect to the Securities and the Guarantees on account of any present or future Taxes. In the event that either the Company or the Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct on account of any Taxes due from any payment made under or with respect to the Securities or the Guarantees, as the case may be, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder of Securities will equal the amount that the Holder would have received if the Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment made to a Holder (an "Excluded Holder") to the extent: (i) that any Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the Holder and Bermuda, other than the mere receipt of the payment, acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Securities or the exercise or enforcement of rights under the Securities, the Guarantees or this Indenture; (ii) of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property Taxes imposed with respect to the Securities or any other Taxes payable other than by withholding or deduction, except as described below or as otherwise provided in this Indenture; (iii) that any such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the presentation of the Securities, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which the payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or Holder thereof would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period; or (iv) that the Holder would not be liable or subject to such withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption, if: (a) the making of the declaration or claim is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant taxing authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes; and (b) at least 60 days prior to the first payment with respect to which the Company or
Payment of Additional Amounts
 
the Guarantor shall apply this clause (iv), the Company or the Guarantor shall have notified all Holders of the Securities in writing that they shall be required to provide this declaration or claim. The Company and the Guarantor shall also (i) withhold or deduct such Taxes as required; (ii) remit the full amount of Taxes deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with all applicable laws; (iii) use reasonable efforts to obtain from each relevant taxing authority imposing the Taxes certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes deducted or withheld; and (iv) upon request, make available to the Holders of the Securities, within 60 days after the date the payment of any Taxes deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Company or the Guarantor and, notwithstanding the Company's or the Guarantor's efforts to obtain the receipts, if the same are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments.
     In addition, the Company or the Guarantor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, documentary or other similar taxes and duties, including interest, penalties and additional amounts with respect thereto, payable in Bermuda or the United States, or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the foregoing with respect to the creation, issue, offering, enforcement, redemption or retirement of the Securities or Guarantees.
     At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Securities is due and payable, if the Company or the Guarantor becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Company (or in respect of the Guarantees, the Guarantor) shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information as is necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders on the payment date. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal of and premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest (including defaulted interest) or any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Securities, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this Section 3.08 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.08 and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made (if applicable).
     If payments with respect of the Securities or the Guarantees become subject generally to the taxing jurisdiction of any Territory or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein having power to tax, other than or in addition to Bermuda or the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority therein or thereof having power to tax, immediately upon becoming aware thereof the Company shall notify the Trustee of such event, and thereupon the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be obligated to pay Additional Amounts in respect thereof on terms corresponding to the terms of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.08 with the substitution for (or, as the case may be, in addition to) the references herein to Bermuda or any political subdivision or authority therein or thereof having power to tax of references to that other or additional Territory or any political subdivision or authority therein or thereof having power to tax to whose taxing jurisdiction such payments shall have become subject as aforesaid. The term "Territory" means for this purpose any jurisdiction in which the
 
Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is incorporated or in which it has its place of central management or central control.
     The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 3.08 shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the payment of all amounts under or with respect to this Indenture and the Securities.
     SECTION 3.09. . So long as any Securities are outstanding, the Guarantor will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, other than any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction:
Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions
          (a) entered into within 360 days of the later of the acquisition or placing into service of the property subject thereto by the Guarantor or such Subsidiary;
          (b) involving a lease of less than five years;
          (c) entered into in connection with an industrial revenue bond or pollution control financing;
          (d) between the Guarantor and/or one or more Subsidiaries;
          (e) as to which the Guarantor or such Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Debt secured by a mortgage on the property to be leased in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction without equally and ratably securing the Securities (1) under clauses (a) through (n) of Section 3.07 or (2) under the last paragraph of Section 3.07; or
          (f) as to which the Guarantor will apply an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the property so leased to (1) the retirement (other than any mandatory retirement), within 360 days of the effective date of any such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, of Securities or of Funded Debt of the Guarantor or a Subsidiary or (2) the purchase or construction of other property, provided that such property is owned by the Guarantor or a Subsidiary free and clear of all mortgages.
     SECTION 3.10. . Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the date of purchase; provided, however, that if such date of purchase is after the taking of a record of the Holders on a record date and on or prior to the related Interest Payment Date, the accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable to the Person in whose name the repurchased Securities are registered on such record date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to repurchase any Securities pursuant to this Section 3.10 to the extent that the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Section 10.07.
Change of Control Offer
 
     For purposes of this Section 3.10, the term "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any one of the following:
          (a) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, amalgamation or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than to the Guarantor or one or more of the Subsidiaries or a combination thereof or a Person controlled by the Guarantor or one or more of the Subsidiaries or a combination thereof;
          (b) the consummation of any transaction (including without limitation, any merger, amalgamation or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than any Subsidiary) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Guarantor, measured by voting power rather than number of shares (excluding a redomestication of the Guarantor); or
          (c) the first day on which the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Guarantor cease to be Continuing Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a "Change of Control" under clause (b) above if (i) the Guarantor becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of a holding company and (ii)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following such transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of the Guarantor immediately prior to such transaction or (B) immediately following such transaction no "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Stock of such holding company, measured by voting power rather than number of shares.
     For purposes of this Section 3.10, the term "Change of Control Triggering Event" means the ratings of the Securities are lowered by at least two of the three Rating Agencies and the Securities cease to be rated Investment Grade by at least two of the three Rating Agencies in any case on any date during the period (the "Trigger Period") commencing on the date of the first public announcement by the Guarantor of any Change of Control (or pending Change of Control) and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control (which 60-day period will be extended for so long as the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Change of Control will be deemed to have occurred in connection with any particular Change of Control unless and until such Change of Control has actually been consummated.
     Within 60 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred, or at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, except to the extent that the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Section 10.07, the Company shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder
 
with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer, stating:
          (1) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require us to purchase such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant Interest Payment Date as provided in the first paragraph of this Section 3.10);
          (2) the circumstances regarding such Change of Control Triggering Event;
          (3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law) (such date, the "Change of Control Payment Date"); and
          (4) the instructions that a Holder must follow in order to have its Securities purchased.
     Holders of Securities electing to have Securities purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer must surrender their Securities, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Security completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice, or transfer their Securities to the Paying Agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the Applicable Procedures, prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
     On the Change of Control Payment Date, all Securities purchased by the Company under this Section shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall pay the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Holders entitled thereto.
     The Company may make a Change of Control Offer in advance of a Change of Control and the Change of Control Payment Date, and its Change of Control Offer may be conditioned upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.
     The Company shall have no obligation to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this Section 3.10 for such an offer made by the Company, and such third party purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section 3.10, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations by virtue thereof.

Successors Substituted

     At any time after such an acceleration has occurred and before a judgment for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article V provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences if:
          (1) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
     (A) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Securities which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and Additional Amounts, if any, and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities or in this Indenture,
     (B) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all Securities,
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest and overdue Additional Amounts, if any, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities or in this Indenture, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
          (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.04.
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     If the Maturity of the Securities is accelerated pursuant to this Section 5.02, 100% of the principal amount thereof and premium, if any, shall become due and payable plus Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment.
     SECTION 5.03. . If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities, the Guarantees or this Indenture.
Other Remedies
     The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any
 
Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
     SECTION 5.04. . Subject to Sections 5.07 and 8.02, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of the Securities, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the Securities then outstanding on equal terms), except (1) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Securities or (2) a continuing Default in respect of a provision that under Section 8.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Waiver of Existing Defaults
     SECTION 5.05. . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it hereunder. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with applicable law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive reasonable indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action subject to the Trustee's duty to act with the required standard of care during a default.
Control by Majority
     SECTION 5.06. . Subject to Section 5.07, a Holder may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture (including the Guarantees) or the Securities only if:
Limitations on Suits
          (i) such Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
          (ii) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
          (iii) such Holder or Holders furnish to the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
          (iv) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the furnishing of indemnity; and
 
          (v) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
     A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
     SECTION 5.07. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security to receive payment of principal of and premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security, or to bring suit against the Company or the Guarantor for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
     SECTION 5.08. . If an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 5.01 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company and the Guarantor (i) for the amount of principal of and premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on any Securities and (ii) interest on overdue principal, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
Collection Suit by Trustee
     SECTION 5.09. . The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any committee of creditors, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company and the Guarantor or their respective creditors or properties and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders of the Securities may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim

Third: to the Company and the Guarantor.
     The Trustee, upon prior written notice to the Company and the Guarantor, may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Article V. At least 15 days before such record date, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder and the Company a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.
     SECTION 5.11. . In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 5.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 5.07, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding.

Duties of Trustee
          (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in such exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
          (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
     (i) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

However, the Trustee shall
 
examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether or not, on their face, they appear to conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
          (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

          (k) The Trustee may request that the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
     SECTION 6.03. . The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Guarantor or any of their Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee.

Trustee's Disclaimer
 
accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any money paid to the Company or upon the Company's direction under any provision hereof, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
     SECTION 6.05. . If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and it is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
Notice of Defaults
     SECTION 6.06. . Within 60 days after May 15 of each year, beginning with May 15, 2008, the Trustee shall mail to Holders a brief report dated as of May 15 of such year that complies with TIA Section 313(a); provided, however, that if no event described in TIA Section 313(a) has occurred within the 12 months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted. The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA Sections 313(c) and 313(d).
Reports by Trustee to Holders
     A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee if and when the Securities are listed on any securities exchange.
     SECTION 6.07. . The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as agreed to by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, for its acceptance of this Indenture and its services hereunder. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
Compensation and Indemnity
     The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee and their agents, employees, stockholders, officers and directors for and to hold them harmless against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, or expense (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and taxes, other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee) incurred by it arising out of or in connection with this Indenture or the administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company and of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, the Guarantor, any Holder or any other Person), except as set forth in the next paragraph. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Guarantor promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity; however, failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Company or the Guarantor of their obligations. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel, and the Company and the Guarantor shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not
 
pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
     Neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through negligence or bad faith.
     To secure the payment obligations of the Company and the Guarantor in this Section 6.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Securities. Such lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
     When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(iv) or (v) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
     SECTION 6.08. . A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 6.08.
Replacement of Trustee
     The Trustee may resign and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Company and the Guarantor. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
          (i) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 6.10;
          (ii) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;

Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
     If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
     If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 6.10, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company and the Guarantor. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 6.07.

     SECTION 6.09. . Subject to Section 6.10, if the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee; provided, however, that in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to another corporation, the transferee corporation expressly assumes all of the Trustee's liabilities hereunder.
Successor Trustee by Merger, etc
     In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.

The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 310(b) during the period of time required by this Indenture.

          (c) . The Company and the Guarantor may, subject as provided herein, be released from their respective obligations to comply with, and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation, set forth in Sections 3.07, 3.08, 3.09 and 4.01 and in Article IX, and such omission to comply with any of Sections 3.07, 3.08, 3.09 and 4.01 and Article IX shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5.01 ("Covenant Defeasance"), with the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities unaffected thereby if:
Covenant Defeasance
     (i) the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments dedicated solely to the benefit of the Holders (A) cash in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay, without consideration of the reinvestment of any such amounts and after payment of all taxes or other charges or assessments in respect thereof payable by the Trustee, the principal of and premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any and interest on all Securities on each date that such principal, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest is due and payable and to pay all other sums payable by it hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money and/or the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to the payment of said principal, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest with respect to the Securities as the same shall become due;
     (ii) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the Covenant Defeasance contemplated by
 
this provision have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect;
     (iii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as clauses (iv) and (v) of Section 5.01 are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period);
     (iv) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from nationally recognized counsel acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the Holders of Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section 7.01(c) and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised;
     (v) such Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or the Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound;
     (vi) such Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest as defined in TIA Section 310(b); and
     (vii) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the passage of 91 days following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
          (d) In order to have money available on a payment date to pay principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Securities, the U.S. Government Obligations shall be payable as to principal or interest on or before such payment date in such amounts as will provide the necessary money. U.S. Government Obligations shall not be callable at the issuer's option.
          (e) The Company may exercise its option under Section 7.01(b) notwithstanding its prior exercise of its Covenant Defeasance option under Section 7.01(c).
     SECTION 7.02. . The Trustee or a trustee satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to Section 7.01. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on Securities with respect to which the deposit was made.
Application of Trust Money
     SECTION 7.03. . The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon written request any excess money or securities held by them at any time. Subject to the requirements of any applicable abandoned property laws, the Trustee
Repayment to Company
 
and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest that remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such payment shall have become due; provided, however, that the Company shall have either caused notice of such payment to be mailed to each Holder entitled thereto no less than 30 days prior to such repayment or within such period shall have published such notice in a financial newspaper of widespread circulation published in The City of New York. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as unsecured general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person, and all liability of the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.
     SECTION 7.04. . If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 7.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 7.01 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 7.01; provided, however, that if the Company or the Guarantor has made any payment of principal of or interest on any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or the Paying Agent.
Reinstatement
     SECTION 8.01. . The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or any of the Securities or waive any provision hereof or thereof without the consent of any Holder:
Without Consent of Holders
     (i) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for the Securities any property or assets;
     (ii) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company or the Guarantor, or successive successions, and the assumption by the successor Person of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Company or the Guarantor pursuant to Section 4.01 or 4.02;
     (iii) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as the Company or the Guarantor and the Trustee shall consider to be for the protection of the Holders of Securities, to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or the Guarantor, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture, provided that in respect of any such
 
additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such amendment or supplement may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities to waive such an Event of Default;
     (iv) to cure any ambiguity or omission or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture, provided that no such action shall adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Securities;
     (v) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, provided that the uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code;
     (vi) to provide for the issuance of Exchange Securities and related Guarantees or Additional Securities and related Guarantees in accordance with this Indenture;
     (vii) to effect or maintain, or otherwise comply with the requirements of the SEC in connection with, the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
     (viii) to effect any provision of this Indenture; or
     (ix) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder.
     Upon the request of the Company and the Guarantor accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors of each of the Company and the Guarantor authorizing the execution of any supplemental indenture entered into to effect any such amendment, supplement or waiver, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantor in the execution of such supplemental indenture. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
     SECTION 8.02. . Except as provided below in this Section 8.02, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture with the consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of the Securities, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the Securities then outstanding on equal terms)
With Consent of Holders
 
of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding affected thereby.
     The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of the Securities, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the Securities then outstanding on equal terms).
     Upon the request of the Company and the Guarantor accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors of each of the Company and the Guarantor authorizing the execution of any supplemental indenture entered into to effect any such amendment, supplement or waiver, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantor in the execution of such supplemental indenture. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     Without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 may not:
     (i) extend the final maturity of the principal of any of the Securities;
     (ii) reduce the principal amount of any of the Securities;
     (iii) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, including default interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any of the Securities;
     (iv) reduce any amount payable on redemption of any of the Securities;
     (v) change the currency in which the principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any of the Securities is payable;
     (vi) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Security pursuant to Sections 5.07 and 5.08, except as limited by Section 5.06;
     (vii) make any change in the percentage of principal amount of the Securities necessary to waive compliance with or to modify certain provisions of
 
this Indenture pursuant to Section 5.04 or 5.07 or this clause of this Section 8.02; or
     (viii) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, including default interest, on the Securities.
     The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of the Securities as of a record date fixed by the Company in accordance with Section 8.04 of this Indenture.
     SECTION 8.03. . Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply in form and substance with the TIA as then in effect.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act
     SECTION 8.04. . A consent to an amendment, a supplement or a waiver by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation at any time prior to (but not after) the date the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder, and a consent thereto given in connection with a tender of a Holder's Securities shall not be rendered invalid by such tender.
Revocation and Effect of Consents
     The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver or to take any other action with respect to the Securities under this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at the close of business on such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date, and for this purpose the Securities then outstanding shall be computed as of such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consents from Holders of the principal amount of the Securities required hereunder for such amendment, supplement or waiver to be effective shall have also been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
     After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (i) through (viii) of Section 8.02. In such case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
 
     SECTION 8.05. . If an amendment or supplement changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment or supplement.
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
     SECTION 8.06. . The Trustee shall sign any supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article VIII if the supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall receive, and subject to Section 6.01, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate, as conclusive evidence that all conditions precedent to such supplemental indenture have been complied with, that such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it will be valid and binding upon the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc
     SECTION 9.01. .
Unconditional Guarantees
          (a) For value received, the Guarantor hereby fully, irrevocably, unconditionally and absolutely guarantees to the Holders and to the Trustee the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Securities and all other amounts due and payable under this Indenture and the Securities by the Company (including, without limitation, all costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in connection with the enforcement of this Indenture, the Securities and the Guarantees) (collectively, the "Indenture Obligations"), when and as such principal, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest and such other amounts shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, upon redemption or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise, according to the terms of the Securities and this Indenture. The guarantees by the Guarantor set forth in this Article IX are referred to herein as the "Guarantees." Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Indenture Obligations and would be owed by the Company under this Indenture and the Securities but for the fact that they are unenforceable, reduced, limited, impaired, suspended or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Company.
          (b) Failing payment when due of any amount guaranteed pursuant to the Guarantees, for whatever reason, the Guarantor will be obligated to pay the same immediately to the Trustee, without set-off or counterclaim or other reduction whatsoever (whether for taxes, withholding or otherwise). The Guarantees are intended to be general, unsecured, senior obligations of the Guarantor and to rank in right of payment with all indebtedness of
pari passu
 
the Guarantor that is not, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantees of the Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations and liabilities of any other obligor with respect to the Securities, the Guarantees or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof with respect to the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Guarantor.
     The Guarantor hereby agrees that in the event of a default in payment of the principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Securities or any other amounts payable under this Indenture and the Securities by the Company, whether at the Stated Maturity, upon redemption or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or, subject to Section 5.06, by the Holders, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Indenture, directly against the Guarantor to enforce the Guarantees without first proceeding against the Company.
          (c) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of the Guarantor under this Article IX shall be as aforesaid full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute and shall not be impaired, modified, discharged, released or limited by any occurrence or condition whatsoever, including, without limitation, (i) any compromise, settlement, release, waiver, renewal, extension, indulgence or modification of, or any change in, any of the obligations and liabilities of any other obligor with respect to the Securities contained in any of the Securities or this Indenture, (ii) any impairment, modification, release or limitation of the liability of the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective estates in bankruptcy, or any remedy for the enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any present or future provision of any applicable Bankruptcy Law, or other statute or from the decision of any court, (iii) the assertion or exercise by the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee of any rights or remedies under any of the Securities or this Indenture or its delay in or failure to assert or exercise any such rights or remedies, (iv) the assignment or the purported assignment of any property as security for any of the Securities, including all or any part of the rights of the Company or the Guarantor under this Indenture, (v) the extension of the time for payment by the Company or the Guarantor of any payments or other sums or any part thereof owing or payable under any of the terms and provisions of any of the Securities or this Indenture or of the time for performance by the Company or the Guarantor of any other obligations under or arising out of any such terms and provisions or the extension or the renewal of any thereof, (vi) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any duty, agreement or obligation set forth in this Indenture of any other obligor with respect to the Securities, (vii) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets, marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment of, or other similar proceeding affecting, either of the Company or the Guarantor or any of its assets, or the disaffirmance of any of the Securities, the Guarantees or this Indenture in any such proceeding, (viii) the release or discharge of the Company or the Guarantor from the performance or observance of any agreement, covenant, term or condition contained in any of such instruments by operation of law, (ix) the unenforceability of any of the obligations of any of the other obligors under the Securities, the Guarantees or this Indenture, (x) any change in the name,
 
business, capital structure, corporate existence, or ownership of the Company or the Guarantor, or (xi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, a surety or the Guarantor.
          (d) The Guarantor hereby (i) waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, notice of acceptance, filing of claims with a court in the event of the merger, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the Guarantor, and all demands and notices whatsoever, (ii) acknowledges that any agreement, instrument or document evidencing the Guarantees may be transferred and that the benefit of its obligations hereunder shall extend to each holder of any agreement, instrument or document evidencing the Guarantees without notice to them and (iii) covenants that its Guarantees will not be discharged except by complete performance of the Guarantees or of the obligations guaranteed thereby. The Guarantor further agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment theretofore applied by any Person to the Guarantees is, or must be, rescinded or returned for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Guarantor, the Guarantees shall, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such application, and the Guarantees shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such application had not been made.
          (e) The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders and the Trustee against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation with respect to any of the Securities until all of the Securities and the Guarantees thereof shall have been paid in full or discharged.
          (f) No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the Holders, any right, power, privilege or remedy under this Article IX and the Guarantees shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any rights, power, privilege or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other rights, powers, privileges or remedies. The rights and remedies herein provided for are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided in law or equity. Nothing contained in this Article IX shall limit the right of the Trustee or the Holders to take any action to accelerate the Maturity of the Securities pursuant to Article V or to pursue any rights or remedies hereunder or under applicable law.
     SECTION 9.02. . To further evidence the Guarantees, the Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantees may be endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that such notation shall be executed by either manual or facsimile signature of an Officer of the Guarantor.
Execution and Delivery of Notation of Guarantees
     The Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantees shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of the Guarantees.
     If an Officer of the Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture or a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates such Security or at any time thereafter, the Guarantor's guarantee of such Security shall be valid nevertheless.
 
     The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantor.
     SECTION 10.01. . If the Company elects to redeem the Securities pursuant to the redemption provisions of Section 10.07, it shall furnish to the Trustee, at least five days before notice of such redemption is to be given pursuant to Section 10.03, an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Redemption Date, the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed and the Redemption Price (or the method of calculating the Redemption Price).
Notices to Trustee
     SECTION 10.02. . If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed by such method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate. The particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption.
Selection of Securities to be Redeemed
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Securities and portions of them selected shall be in minimum amounts of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.
     SECTION 10.03. .
Notices to Holders
          (a) At least 20 days but not more than 75 days before a Redemption Date (unless a different notice period is specified in the Securities), the Company shall mail in conformity with Section 11.02 a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Securities are to be redeemed. The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP, ISIN or similar numbers, if any) and shall state:
     (i) the Redemption Date;
     (ii) the Redemption Price (or the method of calculating the Redemption Price);
     (iii) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that, after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued;
     (iv) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
 
     (v) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent at the address specified in such notice to collect the Redemption Price;
     (vi) that unless the Company defaults in making the redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date and the only remaining right of the Holders is to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities; and
     (vii) the aggregate principal amount of Securities being redeemed.
     If any of the Securities to be redeemed is in the form of a Global Security, then the Company shall modify such notice to the extent necessary to accord with the procedures of the Depositary applicable to redemptions.
          (b) At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice required in Section 10.03(a) in the Company's name; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, at least 15 days prior to the requested mailing date (unless the Trustee consents in writing to a shorter period), an Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in Section 10.03(a).
     SECTION 10.04. . Once notice of redemption is mailed pursuant to Section 10.03, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid out at the Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if the Redemption Date is after the taking of a record of the Holders on a record date and on or prior to the related Interest Payment Date, the accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable to the Person in whose name the redeemed Securities are registered on such record date. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
Effect of Notices of Redemption
     SECTION 10.05. . At or prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent immediately available funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities to be redeemed on that date, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the Redemption Date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall return to the Company any money not required for that purpose less the expenses of the Trustee as provided herein.
Deposit of Redemption Price
     If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph, interest on the Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed (whether or not such Securities are presented for payment) will cease to accrue on the applicable Redemption Date. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, then interest will be paid on the unpaid principal, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Redemption Date until such principal, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, are paid and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities and in Section 3.01.
 
     SECTION 10.06. . Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder, at the expense of the Company, a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.
Securities Redeemed in Part
     SECTION 10.07. . The Securities may be redeemed at any time on such terms and subject to such conditions as are specified in such Securities.
Optional Redemption
     Any redemption pursuant to this Section 10.07 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 10.01 through 10.06.
     SECTION 11.01. . Any reference to a requirement under the TIA shall apply to this Indenture irrespective of whether or not this Indenture is then qualified thereunder. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA (or in any other indenture qualified thereunder), the provision required by the TIA shall control.

The Company and the Guarantor may exclude from such Shelf Registration Statement the Securities or New Securities of any Holder that fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.

          (iii) make such representations and warranties to the Holders of Securities or New Securities registered thereunder and the Underwriters, if any, in
 
form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to Underwriters in primary underwritten offerings and covering matters including, but not limited to, those set forth in the Purchase Agreement;
          (iv) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and the Guarantor and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Underwriters, if any) addressed to each selling Holder and the Underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders and Underwriters;
          (v) obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Securities or New Securities registered thereunder and the Underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings; and

Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company and the Guarantor agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless (i) the Initial Purchasers, (ii) each Holder of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement (including with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 5(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer), (iii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any of the foregoing (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (iii) being hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person"), and (iv) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of the Initial Purchasers, the Holders (including predecessor Holders) or any controlling person (any person referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) may hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified Holder"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) (collectively "Losses") caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" (as defined
 
in Rule 433 of the Securities Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Indemnified Holder furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by such Indemnified Holder expressly for use therein; the Company or the Guarantor shall notify such Indemnified Holder promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any claim, proceeding (including any governmental investigation) or litigation in connection with the matters addressed by this Agreement which involves the Company or the Guarantor or such Indemnified Holder.
          (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Holder, but only with reference to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities which are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to a Holder furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
          (c) Each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to the Initial Purchasers, but only with reference to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities which are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to the Initial Purchasers furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by the Initial Purchasers expressly for use in any Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Initial Purchasers may otherwise have.
          (d) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the three preceding paragraphs, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person or Persons against whom such indemnity may be sought (each an "Indemnifying Person") in writing, and such Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section
 
7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnifying Person shall be able to participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it so elects, jointly with any other similarly situated Indemnifying Person, to assume the defense thereof, subject to the right of the Indemnified Person to be separately represented and to direct its own defense if the named parties to any such proceeding include both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person has been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) such Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnifying Person and an Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that an Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Indemnified Holders shall be designated in writing by the Holders of the majority in amount of Securities and New Securities offered in the Prospectus to which the claim relates, any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, respective officers and such control Persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company, and any such separate firm for the Guarantor, its directors, respective officers and such control Persons of the Guarantor shall be designated in writing by the Guarantor. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, such Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in the first, second and third paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other hand pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or from the offering of the Securities or New Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or (ii) if the
 
allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and any Indemnified Holder on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement received by the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total net proceeds received by such Indemnified Holder from sales of Securities or New Securities giving rise to such obligations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or such Indemnified Holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
          (f) Each of the Company, the Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall any Holder of any Securities or New Securities be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Security or New Security pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holder would have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

              Each broker or dealer that receives new notes for its own account in exchange for old notes that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities must acknowledge that it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any offer, resale, or other transfer of the new notes issued in the exchange offer, including information with respect to any selling holder required by the Securities Act in connection with any resale of the new notes.
 
ANNEX B
          Each broker-dealer that receives new notes for its own account in exchange for old notes, where such old notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any offer, resale or other transfer of such new notes, including information with respect to any selling holder required by the Securities Act in connection with the resale of the new notes. We have agreed that for a period of 180 days after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we will make this prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."
 
ANNEX C
          Each Broker-Dealer that receives New Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such New Securities. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a Broker-Dealer in connection with resales of New Securities received in exchange for Securities where such Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. We have agreed that, starting on the effective date of the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part and ending on the close of business 180-days after such date or such shorter period as will terminate when all New Securities held by Exchanging Dealers or Initial Purchasers have been sold pursuant hereto, we will make this Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available to any Broker-Dealer for use in connection with any such resale. In addition, until ___, 200___, all dealers effecting transactions in the New Securities may be required to deliver a prospectus.
          We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of New Securities by brokers-dealers. New Securities received by Broker-Dealers for their own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the New Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such Broker-Dealer and/or the purchasers of any such New Securities. Any Broker-Dealer that resells New Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such New Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit of any such resale of New Securities and any commissions or concessions received by any such Persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The Letter of Transmittal states that by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a Broker-Dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
          For a period of 180-days after the effective date of the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part or such shorter period as will terminate when all New Securities held by Exchanging Dealers or Initial Purchasers have been sold pursuant hereto, we will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any Broker-Dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal. We have agreed to pay all expenses incident to the Exchange Offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the holder of the Securities) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the holders of the Securities (including any Broker-Dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
