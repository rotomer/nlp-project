On December 28, 2009, the Company and Nabors Industries, Inc. ("Nabors") entered into an amendment to that certain executive employment agreement, dated April 29, 2009, with Eugene M. Isenberg, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the "Isenberg Employment Agreement"). The amendment extends through June 27, 2010 the previously agreed reduction of the annual rate of base salary payable under the Isenberg Employment Agreement from $1.3 million per year to $1.17 million per year.
On December 28, 2009, the Company and Nabors entered into an amendment to that certain executive employment agreement, dated April 29, 2009, with Anthony G. Petrello, the Company's Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer (the "Petrello Employment Agreement"). The amendment extends through June 27, 2010 the previously agreed reduction of the annual rate of base salary payable under the Petrello Employment Agreement from $1.1 million per year to $990,000 per year.
The reductions in the base salaries of Messrs. Isenberg and Petrello are commensurate with salary reductions implemented throughout the Company, including at the Board level, as part of an initiative to reduce costs in light of the current economic downturn. The salary reductions do not affect the calculation or payment of any ancillary benefits.
The Isenberg Employment Agreement and the Petrello Employment Agreement are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to our Form 8-K, dated April 29, 2009.
The foregoing descriptions of the amendments are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies thereof, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 for Mr. Isenberg and Exhibit 10.2 for Mr. Petrello, and incorporated herein by reference.
