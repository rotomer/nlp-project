IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
, August 9, 2010 /PRNewswire  FirstCall  Nabors Industries Ltd. (Nabors) (NYSE: NBR) and Superior Well Services, Inc. (Superior Well Services) (NASDAQ: SWSI) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Nabors will acquire Superior Well Services. The agreement contemplates that Nabors will commence a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Superior Well Services common stock at a price of $22.12 per share in cash in accordance with the merger agreement. The transaction is valued at approximately $900 million.
Hamilton, Bermuda; Indiana, Pennsylvania
Gene Isenberg, Nabors' Chairman and CEO, commented: "For some time now, we have evaluated integrating more service offerings into our business, particularly internationally. Although we expect this acquisition by itself to be significantly accretive to 2011 results, our major motivator was the opportunity to leverage this well respected franchise into a global force utilizing our extensive international footprint and resources.
"In addition to the upside associated with expanding internationally, we expect to derive significant synergies in North America by integrating pumping services with our drilling and workover offerings. The most readily identifiable economies will be derived from our own Oil and Gas entities, with further benefits dependent upon how quickly we can increase activity across more of our fleet. Superior Well Services' broad U.S. presence complements that of both our U.S. Land Drilling and Well-servicing operations and augments our expansion into areas such as the Marcellus shale region.
"Superior Well Services possesses one of the newest fleets in the industry with over 430,000 hydraulic fracturing horsepower. This high quality fleet is operated by a very capable, well managed organization that can quickly become a substantial unit of Nabors. This transaction also provides good value to the Superior Well Services stockholders as the offer price represents an attractive premium to the 30-day average closing stock price."
Superior Well Services' Chairman and CEO David Wallace said: "We are very pleased to be joining forces with Nabors. This complementary combination of the largest land drilling contractor in the world with a leader in technical pumping will make both organizations stronger and better able to meet our customers' needs not only in the U.S., but around the world. We believe this transaction will deliver an immediate and significant premium for our shareholders."
Holders of approximately 34% of Superior Well Services' outstanding shares of common stock have entered into agreements agreeing to tender their shares. Nabors expects to commence the tender offer promptly and expects the offer to close by the end of the third quarter. Following completion of the tender offer, Nabors will acquire any remaining shares of Superior Well Services through a second-step merger at the same price paid in the tender offer.
 
Under the terms of the agreement approved by the boards of directors of both companies, the tender offer is conditioned on the tender of at least a majority of Superior Well Services' shares calculated on a fully diluted basis and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. In addition, the merger agreement requires Superior Well Services to pay Nabors a termination fee of approximately $22.5 million and reimbursable expenses of up to $5 million in the event that the agreement is terminated for certain reasons.
Nabors will hold a conference call to discuss the proposed transaction at 4:00 p.m. Eastern / 3:00 p.m. Central Time on Monday, August 9, 2010. Slides will be posted on the Nabors website shortly before the call and can be accessed at , under Investor Relations  Events Calendar. Please use the following dial-in information:
