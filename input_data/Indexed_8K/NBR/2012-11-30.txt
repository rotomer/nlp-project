Subject to clause (b) below, if the adoption of any applicable law, regulation, treaty or official directive (whether or not having the force of law) or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof by any court or by any Governmental Authority or any other entity charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by the Canadian Lender with any request or direction (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority or entity hereafter:
 
(i)
           
subjects the Canadian Lender to, or causes the withdrawal or termination of any previously granted exemption with respect to, any Taxes (other than Taxes on the Canadian Lender's income, gains or capital), or changes the basis of taxation of payments due to the Canadian Lender, or increases any existing Taxes (other than Taxes on the Canadian Lender's income, gains or capital) on payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable by Canadian Borrower to the Canadian Lender under this Agreement;
 
(ii)
          
imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, liquidity, special deposit, regulatory or similar requirement against assets or liabilities held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by the Canadian Lender, or any acquisition of funds for loans or
commitments to fund loans or obligations in respect of undrawn, committed lines of credit or in respect of Canadian Bankers' Acceptances accepted by the Canadian Lender;
 
(iii)
         
imposes on the Canadian Lender or requires there to be maintained by the Canadian Lender any capital adequacy or additional capital requirements (including a requirement which affects the Canadian Lender's allocation of capital resources to its obligations) in respect of any Canadian Loan or obligation of the Canadian Lender hereunder, or any other condition with respect to this Agreement; or
 
(iv)
         
directly or indirectly affects the cost to the Canadian Lender of making available, funding or maintaining any Canadian Loan or otherwise imposes on the Canadian Lender any other condition or requirement affecting this Agreement or any Canadian Loan or any obligation of the Canadian Lender hereunder;
 
and the result of the foregoing, in the sole determination of the Canadian Lender acting in good faith, is:
 
(v)
          
to increase the cost to the Canadian Lender of performing its obligations hereunder with respect to any Canadian Loan;
 
(vi)
         
to reduce any amount received or receivable by the Canadian Lender hereunder or its effective return hereunder or on its capital in respect of any Canadian Loan;
 
(vii)
        
to reduce the standby fees payable to the Canadian Lender pursuant to ; or

(viii)
       
to cause the Canadian Lender to make any payment with respect to or to forego any return on or calculated by reference to, any amount received or receivable by the Canadian Lender hereunder with respect to any Canadian Loan;
 
the Canadian Lender shall determine that amount of money which shall compensate the Canadian Lender for such increase in cost, payments to be made or reduction in income or return or interest foregone (herein referred to as "").  Upon the Canadian Lender having determined that it is entitled to Additional Compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Canadian Lender shall promptly so notify Canadian Borrower.  The Canadian Lender shall provide Canadian Borrower with a photocopy of the relevant law, rule, guideline, regulation, treaty or official directive (or, if it is impracticable to provide a photocopy, a written summary of the same) and a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Canadian Lender setting forth the Additional Compensation and the basis of calculation therefor, which shall be conclusive evidence of such Additional Compensation in the absence of manifest error.  Canadian Borrower shall pay to the Canadian Lender within 10 Banking Days of the giving of such notice the Canadian Lender's Additional Compensation.  The Canadian Lender shall be entitled to be paid such Additional Compensation from time to time to the extent that the provisions of this Section are then applicable notwithstanding that the Canadian Lender has previously been paid any Additional Compensation.
Additional Compensation
 
(b)

of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or, where the Canadian Lender is not a resident of Canada, that arises as a result of a change of applicable law in Canada.)

Sharing of Set-Off
.  If any US Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its US Loans or other US Obligations resulting in such US Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its US Loans and accrued interest thereon or other US Obligations greater than its share thereof as provided herein, then the US Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
pro rata
US Loans and such other obligations of the other US Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the US Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective US Loans and other amounts owing them, that:
provided
 
(i)
           
if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)
          
the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by US Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (B) any payment obtained by a US Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its US Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to Holdings or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
 
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.  If under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or any similar law any Beneficiary receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff or counterclaim to which this  applies, such Beneficiary shall to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights to which the Beneficiary is entitled under this  to share in the benefits of the recovery of such secured claim.

In such event, if US Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the US Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such US Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

(i)
           
With respect only to US Obligations, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of US Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Requirements of Law.  If the applicable Withholding Agent shall be required by applicable Requirements of Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of the applicable Withholding Agent) to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deductions or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable US Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions
or withholdings have been made (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made.
 
(ii)
          
With respect only to Canadian Obligations:
 
(A)
         
any and all payments by Canadian Borrower to the Canadian Lender hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any and all present or future Taxes imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority or under the laws of any international tax authority imposed on the Canadian Lender, or by or on behalf of the foregoing (and, for greater certainty, nothing in this Section shall make Canadian Borrower liable for any Taxes imposed on or measured by the recipient's income, gains or capital).  In addition, Canadian Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp, transfer, registration, excise, issues, documentary or other taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under this Agreement or the Canadian Loans or in respect of the execution, delivery or registration or the compliance with this Agreement or the other Documents contemplated hereunder other than taxes imposed on or measured by the recipient's income, gains or capital.  Canadian Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Canadian Lender for the full amount of all of the foregoing Taxes or other amounts paid or payable by the Canadian Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) resulting therefrom or with respect thereto which arise from any payment made under or pursuant to this Agreement or the Canadian Loans or in respect of the execution, delivery or registration of, or compliance with, this Agreement or the other Documents other than Taxes imposed on or measured by the recipient's income, gains, capital or amounts in respect of which a sum payable hereunder has been increased under the immediately succeeding clause (B).
 
(B)
         
If Canadian Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any amount from any payment or other amount required to be paid to the Canadian Lender hereunder, or if any liability for Taxes shall be imposed or shall arise from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder, then the sum payable to the Canadian Lender hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings payable for additional sums payable under this provision) the Canadian Lender receives an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made; in addition, Canadian Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld for such liabilities to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law, such payment to be made (if the liability is imposed on Canadian Borrower) for its own account or (if the liability is imposed on the Canadian Lender) on behalf of and in the name of the Canadian Lender.  If the liability is imposed on the Canadian Lender, Canadian Borrower shall deliver to the Canadian Lender evidence satisfactory to the Canadian Lender, acting reasonably, of the payment to the relevant taxation authority or other authority of the full amount deducted or withheld.
 
(C)
         
The Canadian Lender shall use reasonable efforts to contest (to the extent contestation is reasonable) such imposition or assertion of such Taxes and shall reimburse to Canadian Borrower the amount of any reduction, or credit, relief or remission in respect of, Taxes, to the extent of amounts that have been paid by Canadian Borrower in respect of such Taxes in accordance with this Agreement, as a result of such contestation or otherwise and, provided that, the Canadian Lender shall not have any
obligation to expend its own funds, suffer any economic hardship or take any action detrimental to its interests (as determined by the Canadian Lender in its sole discretion, acting reasonably) in connection therewith unless it shall have received from Canadian Borrower payment therefor or an indemnity with respect thereto, satisfactory to it.
 
(b)
          
Payment of Other Taxes by US Borrower
.  Without limiting the provisions of  above, the US Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes imposed on or with respect to any obligation of US Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document to which it is a party.
paragraph (a)
 
(c)
          
Indemnification by US Borrower
.  The US Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 20 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid or payable by such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to US Borrower by a US Lender Party (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a US Lender Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Recipient shall be indemnified for any Indemnified Taxes hereunder unless the Recipient makes written demand on US Borrower for such reimbursement no later than six months after the earlier of (i) the date on which the relevant Governmental Authority makes written demand upon such Recipient for payment of such Indemnified Taxes, and (ii) the date on which such Recipient has made payment of such Indemnified Taxes; that if the Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted giving rise to such claims are retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Evidence of Payments
.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a US Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this , the US Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

In addition, any US Lender Party, if reasonably requested by US Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by US Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable US Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such US Lender Party is subject to information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.18(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

Requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law to permit US Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)
         
In the case of a US Lender Party that would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA on payments made to or on account of such US Lender Party hereunder or any other Loan Document if such US Lender Party were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such US Lender Party shall deliver to US Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by US Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by US Borrower and the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for US Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such US Lender Party has complied with such US Lender Party's obligations under FATCA, or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from any such payments.  Solely for purposes of this paragraph, "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each US Lender Party agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify US Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

Treatment of Certain Refunds
.  If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.18 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this ), it shall pay to US Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by US Borrower under this Section 2.18 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Recipient and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that US Borrower, upon the request of such Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to US Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18 ( any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Recipient in the event such Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to US Borrower or any other person.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event will a Recipient be required to pay any amount to US Borrower the payment of which would place such Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had never been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

(b)
                                
Posting of Approved Electronic Communications
.  Each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor agree that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the Approved Electronic Communications available to the Lender Parties by posting such Approved Electronic Communications on IntraLinks or a substantially similar electronic platform chosen by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the "").
Approved Electronic Platform
 
(i)
                                    
Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution.  In consideration for the convenience and other benefits afforded by such distribution and for the other consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor hereby approves distribution of the Approved Electronic Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.

NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE AGENT PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.

Treatment of Information
.
 
(i)
                                    
Certain of the Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Obligors or their securities ("").  Other Lenders may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that may contain Restricting Information.  Each Lender Party acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of material, non-public information concerning the such issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other person.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any Communications (including Restricting Information) available to a Lender Party, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Lender Party or otherwise, make or be deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any such information or Communication does or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or liable in any way for any decision a Lender Party may make to limit or to not limit its access to Restricting Information.  In particular, none of the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties (i) shall have, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Lender Party has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Lender Party's policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, nonpublic information or such Lender Party's compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (ii) shall have, or incur, any liability to any Obligor or Lender Party or any of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating to the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Lender Party.
Restricting Information
 
(ii)
                                 
Each Obligor agrees that (i) all Communications it provides to the Administrative Agent intended for delivery to the Lender Parties whether by posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked "PUBLIC" if such Communications do not contain Restricting Information which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word "PUBLIC" shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by marking Communications "PUBLIC," each Obligor shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties to treat such Communications as either publicly available information or not material information (although, in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information and, therefore, remain subject to the confidentiality undertakings of ) with respect to such Obligor or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws, (iii) all Communications marked "PUBLIC" may be delivered to all Lender Parties and may be made available through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated "Public Side Information," and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked "PUBLIC" as Restricting Information and may post such Communications to a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform not designated "Public Side Information."  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any statement or other designation by an Obligor regarding whether a Communication contains or does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Obligors or their securities nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates incur any liability to any Obligor, any Lender Party or any other person for any action taken by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates based upon such statement or designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information is provided to a Lender Party that may decide not to take access to Restricting Information.  Nothing in this
Section 14.12
Section shall modify or limit a Lender Party's obligations under with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality of or other treatment of Information.
Section 14.12
 
(iii)
                              
Each Lender Party acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications that might contain Restricting Information.  Accordingly, each Lender Party agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such designee's contact information) on such Lender Party's Administrative Questionnaire.  Each Lender Party agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time of such Lender Party's designee's e-mail address to which notice of the availability of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic transmission.
 
(iv)
                             
Each Lender Party acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder and under the other Loan Documents may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Lender Parties generally.  Each Lender Party that elects not to take access to Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and other Lender Parties may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Lender Party.  None of the Administrative Agent nor any Lender Party with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Lender Party or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Lender Party, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information.
 
(v)
                                
The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this Section are designed to assist the Administrative Agent, the Lender Parties and the Obligors, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Lender Parties express a desire not to receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or other information provided to the Lender Parties hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that an Obligor's or Lender Party's adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such Obligor or Lender Party with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in respect of Restricting Information and each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor assumes the risks associated therewith.

Annex I
 
 
 
For purposes of the above, (i) if any of Moody's or S&P or Fitch's shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established the same rating as the rating agency that has in effect the higher rating for the Index Debt; that if none of Fitch's, Moody's or S&P has in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then the Level IV rating in the above grid shall be the rating deemed in effect; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Fitch's, Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within two different Levels, the Applicable Margin shall be based on the higher of the two Levels, but if the three ratings are separated by more than one rating Level, the Applicable Margin shall be the rating Level that is one lower than the highest such rating Level; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Fitch's, Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody's, S&P or Fitch's), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency, irrespective of when or whether notice of such change shall have been furnished by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

provided
 
 
(ii) the next rollover or conversion thereof after such change or cessation in rating, as the case may be.  If the rating system of Fitch's, Moody's or S&P shall change, or if no such rating agency shall then be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Loan Parties and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

Schedule II

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Hamilton, Bermuda
, November 29, 2012/ PR Newswire  FirstCall  today announced the closing of an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, comprised of a US dollar-denominated loan facility of up $1.45 billion and a  Canadian dollar-denominated  loan facility of up to $50 million.  The duration of the facility is five years.  The terms of the new facility are substantially the same as the $750 million credit facility established in September 2010 and the $700 million credit facility established in April 2011, both of which were terminated contemporaneously with the establishment of the new facility.  A Canadian $50 million unsecured revolving loan facility was also terminated contemporaneously with the establishment of the new facility.  The new facility includes an accordion feature that would allow the Company to add lenders and increase the aggregate principal amount up to $1.95 billion.  Interest margins and undrawn fees are based upon the Company's senior unsecured credit ratings.  When drawn, US dollar-denominated borrowings under the facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) one, two, three or six months LIBOR, or (b) the higher of the prime commercial rate of Citibank, N.A., the Federal Funds Rate plus  of 1%, or one month LIBOR plus 1.05%, in each case plus the applicable margin.  Based upon the Company's current credit ratings, the interest margin and undrawn fees under option (a) would be 130bps and 20bps, respectively, and 25bps and 20 bps under option (b).  The interest mechanism for any loans denominated in Canadian dollars is similar.  The Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the obligations of its subsidiaries that are the borrowers under the credit facility.
