We are focused on two key objectives: increasing NASDAQ's share of trading in domestic equity markets; and increasing the number of companies listed on NASDAQ.   To achieve this, we are enhancing the functionality of our trading systems and taking steps to achieve price leadership.  Additionally, our new dual listing capability advertises NASDAQ's performance to issuers, which we have further supported by refocusing our sales force and enhancing our suite of services offered to issuers.  NASDAQ is the premier equity marketplace, offering a cost-effective trading platform open to multiple participants that provides investors security and protection.  Our entire organization is energized and focused on this mission."
