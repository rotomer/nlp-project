By the Closing Date, Seller shall deposit into escrow with a standard escrow provider for a period of three (3) years a copy of the Brut ECN Software, the BRASS System, UMA, U2 and X2, in each case, as such Software exists as of the date of this Agreement and an independent party hired by Buyer, reasonably acceptable to Seller, may have reasonable access to such escrowed Software in order to facilitate compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
