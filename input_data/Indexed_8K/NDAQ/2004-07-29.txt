Exhibit 99.1
 
 
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ"; OTCBB: NDAQ), today reported results for the second quarter 2004. Net income was $4.8 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004 versus net income of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2004 and a net loss of $49.0 million for the second quarter of 2003, which includes continued and discontinued operations.  Net income applicable to common shareholders for the second quarter 2004 was $1.3 million, or $0.02 per common share versus net loss applicable to common shareholders of $51.5 million, or $(0.66) per common share, for the second quarter of 2003.  Following the transfer of NASDAQ's interest in NASDAQ Europe and the sale of IndigoMarkets in 2003, results from these subsidiaries have been reclassified as discontinued operations. The remainder of this discussion reflects results from continuing operations.

Total revenue in second quarter 2004 decreased 18.7% to $120.0 million from $147.6 million a year ago, and decreased 6.5% sequentially.  Net income was $4.8 million, or $0.02 per common share for the second quarter of 2004, versus a net loss from continuing operations of $32.4 million, or $(0.45) per common share, for the second quarter of 2003.
 
NASDAQ's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greifeld, commented, "During the second quarter NASDAQ made continued progress toward our strategic objectives. While weak volumes market-wide pressured revenue, ongoing expense reductions produced an increase in profits from last quarter. Further, we believe we are beginning to stabilize market share through price leadership and ongoing product enhancements. NASDAQ's Closing Cross in particular is gaining traction as evidenced by its use in the Russell indexes rebalancing. NASDAQ has a strong record in winning new stock issues that are attracted to our open, competitive marketplace and we continue to see increased recognition of the benefits our electronic model brings to shareholders."
 
Mr. Greifeld concluded, "As we enter the second half of the year, we will continue to execute aggressively on our strategic plan to increase NASDAQ's trading share, capture additional issuer listings, and reduce our ongoing expense base to create a strong and sustainable profitable business model. In the Market Services segment, this year we are on track to roll out NASDAQ's Opening Cross price discovery facility and introduce additional order types, both of which are designed to enhance NASDAQ's compelling market proposition and further attract trade printing.  Our Issuer Services segment is keenly focused on communicating the
benefits of our enhanced services to existing and potential new issuers.  We continue to maintain our commitment to excellence in the speed, usability and performance of our trading platform and increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our operations.  Our ultimate objective is to reinforce NASDAQ's standing as the marketplace of choice for all participants and to lever this status to create solid long-term earnings growth."
 
NASDAQ continues to review opportunities to improve the efficiency of its operations.  As a result of these reviews, NASDAQ changed the estimated useful life of certain assets and operating leases associated with its technology and telecommunications platforms as it migrates to lower cost operating environments and processes.  This change resulted in incremental depreciation and amortization expense of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2004.  This incremental expense is now expected to be approximately $16.0 million this year, including this quarter's expense and $7.1 million recorded in the first quarter.  Additionally, in July NASDAQ made a decision to move ahead with opportunities to consolidate space in leased real estate facilities, and expects to record charges associated with this action of approximately $22 million to $24 million in 2004.  Finally, NASDAQ is moving forward with plans to offer new, more cost-efficient market access for participants.  This initiative will result in NASDAQ discontinuing support for Workstation and API connectivity via the Service Delivery Platform by the fourth quarter 2005.  This initiative will have an immaterial impact to NASDAQ's operating results.
 
NASDAQ's Chief Financial Officer, David Warren, commented: "NASDAQ continues to implement our program to reduce our cost base, lowering direct expenses by over 25% from last year's second quarter.  Our ongoing objective is to right-size our operating and asset bases to match our revenue platform regardless of competitive environment, yet create a cost model that can profitably support revenue expansion."
 
Total revenue in the first six months of 2004 decreased 19.9% to $248.4 million from $310.0 million a year ago.  Net income for the first six months of 2004 was $9.4 million versus a net loss from continuing operations of $26.5 million for the first six months of 2003.  Net income applicable to common shareholders for the first six months of 2004 was $3.1 million, or $0.04 per common share versus net loss of $29.7 million, or $(0.38) per common share for the first six months of 2003.

Financial Review:

Of this, NASDAQ Market Center net revenue decreased 28.4% to $45.1 million from $63.0 million in the year-ago quarter due to declines in market share of printed shares and the effect of price reductions. Market Center revenues decreased 10.5% from the first quarter of 2004 primarily due to lower trading volumes. Market Services Subscription net revenue decreased 31.5% to $21.5 million from $31.4 million in the year-ago quarter due to an increase in UTP plan revenue sharing and the introduction of the NASDAQ General Revenue Sharing Program.  Market Services Subscription net revenues decreased 6.5% from $23.0 million in first quarter 2004 primarily due to an increase in UTP plan revenue sharing.
