Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ"; OTCBB: NDAQ), today reported a net loss of $5.5 million or $(0.08) per common share for the third quarter versus a net loss of loss of $38.0 million or $(0.52) per common share for the third quarter of 2003 and net income of $4.8 million or $0.02 per common share in the second quarter of 2004(1).
 
Total revenue in third quarter 2004 was $124.0 million versus $141.9 million for the third quarter 2003 and $120.0 million for the second quarter 2004. Gross margin for the third quarter 2004 was $114.8 million versus $141.9 million in the year ago period and $120.0 million in second quarter 2004.
 
Included in third quarter 2004 results are $22.4 million of pre-tax charges associated with NASDAQ's continuing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce operating expenses.  Excluding these expenses, net income calculated on a non-GAAP basis was $8.1 million versus $8.4 million for the second quarter 2004.  Non-GAAP earnings per common share were $0.09 for the quarter versus $0.07 per share for the second quarter 2004.
 
NASDAQ's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greifeld, commented, "NASDAQ's non-GAAP earnings for the third quarter were comparable to second quarter results despite the fact that average daily share volume decreased 10.9% from the second quarter.  These results reflect the strength of our diversified business model and our continuing efforts to reduce operating expenses.  Heading into the close of the year, NASDAQ is building an increasingly strong competitive position.  The integration of Brut is proceeding smoothly and we recently launched the NASDAQ Opening Cross.  Our goal is to provide investors, issuers and market participants with the highest quality equity market in the world.  We will judge our success by the innovation and quality service we deliver in all of our businesses."
 
Non-Recurring Expenses
 
During the third quarter, NASDAQ took pre-tax charges totaling $22.4 million and expects to take additional net charges of approximately $11.0 million in the fourth quarter as part of its ongoing review to reduce operating expenses and improve the efficiency of its operations:
 
 - 
      - NASDAQ took a charge of $4.8 million in the third quarter for severance and outplacement costs, reducing the workforce to 891 employees at quarter-end, with plans to eliminate an additional 80 positions in the fourth quarter.
Workforce Reductions
 - 
      - As part of its real estate consolidation plans, NASDAQ plans to sublease surplus office space at its One Liberty Plaza headquarters located in New York, resulting in an estimated loss on sublease of $12.8 million in the third quarter and an additional charge of $5.0 million in the fourth quarter 2004. In response to market opportunities, NASDAQ updated its plans for facilities in Maryland.  As a result, NASDAQ plans to sell an owned facility in Maryland and will take a charge of approximately $9.0 million in the fourth quarter 2004.  In the third quarter 2004 NASDAQ released a sublease loss reserve of $1.9 million, net of rental payments, associated with a leased Maryland facility that the company had previously decided to vacate.  Additionally, in the third quarter the company recorded $1.1 million in incremental depreciation expense associated with data center facility assets due to a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets and will incur an additional $3.4 million in the fourth quarter.  The company estimates total 2004 charges associated with real estate consolidations to be approximately $29.4 million with the remaining $17.4 million to be incurred in the fourth quarter 2004.
Real Estate
 - 
      - As previously announced, NASDAQ changed the estimated useful life of certain assets and changed the lease terms on certain operating leases associated with its technology and telecommunications platforms as it migrates to lower cost operating environments and processes. This change resulted in incremental depreciation and amortization expense of $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter NASDAQ expects to incur approximately $8.0 million in additional charges related to its continuing review of technology operations.
Technology Review
 - 
      - It is expected that negotiations related to NASDAQ Europe obligations will be completed in the fourth quarter 2004.  As a result NASDAQ expects to report the release of approximately $15.0 million in liabilities that were previously recorded to satisfy potential claims.
NASDAQ Europe
 
NASDAQ's Chief Financial Officer, David Warren, commented: "NASDAQ's real estate, technology and corporate expense actions are designed to improve productivity and streamline processes, allowing for a leaner organization and increasing our long-term earnings potential.  Given our plans for further actions of this type, we anticipate continued success in our expense reduction efforts."
 
Q3 Financial Review
 
Following the transfer of NASDAQ's interest in NASDAQ Europe and the sale of IndigoMarkets in 2003, results from these subsidiaries have been reclassified as discontinued operations. The remainder of this discussion reflects results from continuing operations.  Additionally, the acquisition of Brut, LLC and affiliated entities (Brut) was completed on September 7, 2004; third quarter 2004 results include Brut's operations from the date of closing.
 
 - 
       Total revenue in third quarter 2004 decreased 12.6% to $124.0 million from $141.9 million in the year-ago quarter and increased 3.3% from $120.0 million in the second quarter of 2004.  Brut revenues are reported on a gross basis and exclude certain costs of revenues such as liquidity rebate payments as Brut acts as principal in these transactions.  These costs are included in Cost of Revenues.
Total Revenue
 - 
      Market Services - Revenues decreased 18.3% to $73.3 million from $89.7 million in the year-ago period and increased 6.4% from the prior quarter. Of this, NASDAQ Market Center(2) revenue decreased 7.4% to $52.8 million from $57.0 million in the year-ago quarter due to declines the number of trader
log-ons, the effect of price reductions, lower average daily trading volume, and declines in the percentage of share volume reported to NASDAQ systems. These declines were partially offset by an increase in market share during the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the acquisition of Brut.   Market Center revenues increased 17.1% from the second quarter of 2004 primarily due the acquisition of Brut.  Market Services Subscriptions revenue decreased 40.4% to $18.3 million from $30.7 million in the year-ago quarter due to an increase in UTP plan revenue sharing and the introduction of the NASDAQ General Revenue Sharing Program.  Market Services Subscriptions revenues decreased 14.5% from $21.4 million in second quarter 2004 primarily due to an increase in UTP plan revenue sharing.
 - 
      Issuer Services - Revenues increased 0.4% to $50.7 million from $50.5 million from the year-ago period and decreased 0.8% from the prior quarter. Of this, Corporate Client Group revenue increased 0.2% to $41.3 million from $41.2 million in both the year-ago quarter and prior quarter. Initial listing fees and fees associated with the listing of additional shares are amortized over six-year and four-year periods, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. NASDAQ Financial Products revenue increased 1.1% to $9.4 million from $9.3 million in the year-ago quarter and decreased 5.1% from the prior quarter.
 
 - 
      - Beginning with third quarter 2004 results, NASDAQ will report cost of revenues and gross margin associated with the integrated Brut, LLC operations; NASDAQ's historical revenue will continue to be reported on a net basis.  Gross margin, which represents total revenue less the cost of revenues related to Brut, was $114.8 million as compared to $141.9 million a year ago and $120.0 million in second quarter 2004.

Included in direct expenses is $22.4 million in above-mentioned pretax charges. Excluding these charges, third quarter 2004 non-GAAP direct expenses were $90.2 million, a decrease of 3.7% from prior quarter non-GAAP results primarily due to ongoing cost reduction activities.
Direct Expenses
 - 
      - Total expenses decreased 20.0% to $123.7 million from $154.7 million in the year-ago quarter and increased 11.0% from the prior quarter. The third quarter of 2004 includes the $22.4 million in pre-tax charges noted above. Excluding these charges, third quarter 2004 non-GAAP total expenses were $101.3 million, a decrease of 3.9% from prior quarter non-GAAP results primarily due to ongoing cost reduction activities.
Total Expenses
 - 
      - NASDAQ obtained a waiver from the NASD for the third quarter 2004 reducing the coupon on the Series A Preferred Stock to 3.0% from 10.6%, a benefit of $0.03 per common share.

Non-GAAP Information
In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), NASDAQ also discloses certain Non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. Management believes that the Non-GAAP information provides investors with additional information to access NASDAQ's operating performance by excluding these costs, which are non-operational items. The Non-GAAP information may not be comparable to other companies and should not be viewed as a substitute for or superior to net loss or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation table is provided at the end of this release.
