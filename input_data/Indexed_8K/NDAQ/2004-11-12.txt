additional annual fee of $500,000 to Nasdaq for the right to trade QQQ in Foreign regions.  Amex will begin paying this $500K additional annual fee upon its registration of QQQ for listing on any market in a Foreign region.  Although this annual fee shall be paid quarterly by Amex on a prorated basis, Amex will adjust the amount of its payment in the last quarter of each year to ensure that it has paid the entire $500K fee to Nasdaq on an annual basis.  If Amex does not trade QQQ in any market in a foreign region, it will no longer be liable to Nasdaq for the payment of this fee, that if Amex lists or trades QQQ in any market in a Foreign region for at least one day in any quarter, Amex will remain liable to pay the entire quarterly fee to Nasdaq for such listing.
provided, however,
 
Amex shall pay all fees and expenses necessary to obtain the right to list QQQ in any Foreign region.  In addition, Amex shall reimburse Nasdaq for all reasonable expenses incurred by Nasdaq in connection with such listing, including, but not limited to, Nasdaq's reasonable outside legal and other professional fees related to the filing by Nasdaq of all related applications and the obtaining by Nasdaq of all licenses, permits, consents and approvals required by applicable Governmental Entities. Nasdaq will use its best commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the Amex's right to list QQQ in any Foreign region within a reasonable time frame.  Amex will also be responsible for the payment of any incremental fees or expenses, including reasonable outside incremental legal and other professional fees, incurred by Nasdaq in addition to the normal fees and related expenses required to obtain permission to list QQQ in any Foreign region, if Nasdaq incurred such additional fees or expenses due to Amex's failure to provide reasonable advance notice to Nasdaq of Amex's intent to obtain the right to list QQQ in that region.  If Amex reimburses Nasdaq for such costs, and then begins listing QQQ in such Foreign region, Amex will then have the exclusive right to list QQQ in that Foreign region for a period of **** from the date that Amex reimbursed Nasdaq for the costs that Nasdaq incurred in obtaining Amex's right to list QQQ in that region.  If, however, Amex reimburses Nasdaq for such costs, and then refrains from listing or trading QQQ in such Foreign region, Amex will then have the exclusive right to list QQQ in that Foreign region for a period of **** from the date that Amex reimbursed Nasdaq for the costs that Nasdaq incurred in obtaining Amex's right to list QQQ in that Foreign region.  Upon the expiration of this **** period, Nasdaq may then: (i) reimburse Amex for the fees and expenses paid by Amex to obtain the right to list QQQ in that Foreign region; and (ii) begin listing QQQ in that region.  If Nasdaq obtains the right to list QQQ in such Foreign region subsequent to any exclusivity period for Amex, then the parties will equally share the costs incurred by both parties for the right to list QQQ in that Foreign region.
