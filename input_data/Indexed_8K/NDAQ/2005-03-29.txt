Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Nasdaq entered into letter agreements with six of its executive officers, effective as of March 23, 2005 ("Letter Agreements"), that provide enhanced severance benefits if these executives are terminated in connection with a change in control of Nasdaq. The six executive officers, all executive vice presidents, are: Bruce Aust, Christopher Concannon, Adena Friedman, John Jacobs, Steven Randich and David Warren.
 
The form of the Letter Agreement was previously approved by Nasdaq's Board of Directors and the terms of the Letter Agreement were previously disclosed on Nasdaq's Form 8-K dated February 9, 2005. A change in control for purposes of the Letter Agreement generally consists of the first to occur of the following:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Under the Letter Agreement, if an executive is terminated by Nasdaq without cause or the executive resigns for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Letter Agreement), during (x) the 180 day period immediately prior to a change in control (if the executive can reasonably demonstrate that the termination or Good Reason event was at the request of a third party that does thereafter effect a change in control of Nasdaq) or (y) during the one year period after the change in control, then he or she is entitled to the following payments and benefits from Nasdaq:
 
 
 
 
An executive is not entitled to benefits under the Letter Agreement if his or her termination is on account of death or disability.
 
The Letter Agreement does not change the terms of the executive's outstanding equity awards (which generally fully vest upon an executive's termination following a change in control) or retirement plan benefits, which continue to be governed by the terms of the respective arrangements. In addition, the Letter Agreement does not provide for indemnification of any "golden parachute" excise taxes that may be payable by an executive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended in connection with the change in control. Rather, the Letter Agreement provides if any payments or benefits to an executive would be subject to a golden parachute excise tax under Section 4999 payments and/or benefits to the executive will be reduced or "cut back" so that no such golden parachute excise tax will be due.
 
The Letter Agreement contains restrictive covenants, including requiring the executive to maintain the confidentiality of Nasdaq's proprietary information and to refrain from disparaging Nasdaq. The Letter Agreement also prohibits the executive from soliciting Nasdaq employees or rendering services for a competing entity for a period of one year following termination in connection with a change in control. To receive severance benefits under the Letter Agreement, the executive must execute a general release of claims against Nasdaq. In addition, payments and benefits under the Letter Agreement are generally subject to discontinuation in the event an executive breaches the restrictive covenants.
 
Copies of each of the Letter Agreements filed herewith, are incorporated herein by reference.
