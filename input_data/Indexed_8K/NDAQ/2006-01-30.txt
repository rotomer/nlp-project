Exhibit 99.1
 
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

New York, New York 10006
 
 
 
 
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ
"; Nasdaq: NDAQ), today reported fourth quarter 2005 net income of $17.1 million or $0.15 per diluted share versus net income of $17.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005 and net income of $7.4 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004. 2004 results reflect continuing and discontinued operations, and include a net gain of $9.6 million from discontinued operations. Net loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2004 was $2.2 million or $(0.10) per diluted share. The remainder of this discussion reflects results from continuing operations, which includes INET operations beginning December 8, 2005.
 
Net income from continuing operations for the full year 2005 was $61.7 million or $0.57 per diluted share versus net income of $1.8 million or a loss of $(0.14) per diluted share for the full year 2004.
 
Gross margin, which represents total revenues less cost of revenues, was $138.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 14.2% from $121.4 million in the year-ago period and 6.1% from $130.6 million in the third quarter of 2005. Gross margin for the full year 2005 was $526.0 million, an increase of 8.5% from $484.6 million in 2004.
 
"2005 was a highly successful year for NASDAQ, both as a stock market and as a public company", commented NASDAQ's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greifeld. "Our financial performance was exceptional, with strong fourth quarter earnings growth from last year capping off a period of increased productivity. We continue to transform our organization by accelerating the pace of innovation in every aspect of our business, expanding our scale and functionality, and pioneering new products and services."
 
Mr. Greifeld concluded, "The hard work completed over the past two years gives NASDAQ a formidable competitive position. In 2006 we will begin operations as an independent registered exchange on the threshold of historic changes in our industry. Our 2006 priorities are to: complete the INET integration; increase our market share of U.S equity trading and company listings; and raise the value of our proprietary market data products; while maintaining the discipline necessary to complete our cost reduction program. In this increasingly competitive world, NASDAQ is committed to maintaining its position as the premier equity marketplace through sustained execution of our well-founded strategy."
 
Recent Highlights
 
 
 
 
Charges Associated with NASDAQ's Cost Reduction Program and INET Integration
 
Included in total expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2005 are net pre-tax charges of $2.1 million and $20.0 million, respectively, relating to NASDAQ's continuing efforts to reduce operating expenses and improve the efficiency of its operations, as well as fourth quarter charges associated with the acquisition and integration of the INET ECN. Included in the fourth quarter 2005 charges is the release of a $12.1 million sublease loss reserve which was recorded in the third quarter 2004 as this space will now be used to support INET operations. Excluding the release of the sublease loss reserve, total pre-tax charges taken during fourth quarter and full year 2005 are $14.2 million and $32.1 million, respectively.
 
The net pre-tax charges of $2.1 million and $20.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter and full year 2005 include:
 
 
 
 
2006 Outlook
 
NASDAQ expects the following results for the full-year 2006:
 
 
 
 
Included in 2006 total expense projections are approximately $60.0 million to $70.0 million of pre-tax charges associated with NASDAQ's continuing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce operating expenses and to integrate the INET ECN. These charges include:
 
 
 
 
The impact of these charges is expected to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.32 per diluted share for the year. In future years, NASDAQ expects to fully realize synergies associated with the INET acquisition, with benefits recognized as both gross margin increases and reductions to expenses. Total expenses for the full year 2007 are anticipated to decline 20.0% to 25.0% from 2006 levels, the year immediately following completion of the integration.
 
These projections reflect the impact of the issuance of primary shares in an offering, announced earlier this month. NASDAQ plans to sell its own shares in this offering to redeem its Series C preferred stock, with any further proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions.
 
NASDAQ's Chief Financial Officer, David Warren, commented: "In 2005, NASDAQ executed very well to plan, growing the top-line, reducing our baseline expenses and generating a significant increase in net income. From its inception in 2003, our strategic review and cost reduction road map has removed more than $260.0 million in real estate, overhead, and technology expenses from our cost structure. This record of consistent, focused achievement demonstrates our ability to maintain this momentum throughout the remainder of the roadmap while also accomplishing a successful INET integration, already underway. Our entire organization is energized to accomplish our objectives and to continue NASDAQ's impressive record of financial, operational, and competitive achievement."
 
Q4 Financial Review
 
 Fourth quarter results include INET operations following the completion of the acquisition on December 8, 2005. Prior to the second quarter 2005, NASDAQ's other execution revenues were reported net of liquidity rebates as NASDAQ does not act as principal. However, in the second quarter 2005, under NASDAQ's new Limitation of Liability Rule, NASDAQ has recorded all execution revenues from transactions executed through the NASDAQ Market Center on a gross basis in revenues and has recorded liquidity rebate payments from transactions executed through the NASDAQ Market Center as cost of revenues as NASDAQ now has risk associated with trade execution subject to rule limitations. This change was made on a prospective basis beginning April 1, 2005 as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Total Revenues and Gross Margin
 
For the fourth quarter 2005, gross margin increased 14.2% to $138.6 million from $121.4 million in the year-ago quarter and increased 6.1% from $130.6 million in the third quarter of 2005.
 
 
 
 
 Total expenses decreased 13.2% to $105.4 million from $121.4 million in the year-ago quarter and increased 6.1% from $99.3 million in the prior quarter. The fourth quarter of 2005 includes the $2.1 million in net pre-tax charges noted above. The fourth quarter 2004 included $25.5 million of similar charges.
Total Expenses
 
Earnings Per Share
 
As stated above, fourth quarter earnings (loss) per diluted share were $0.15 versus $0.16 reported for the third quarter of 2005, and $(0.10) per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. NASDAQ's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share was 122.5 million in the quarter versus 79.3 million last year and 119.4 million last quarter, due primarily to the dilutive impact of the convertible notes and related warrants issued in April 2005 in connection with the acquisition of INET ECN.
