Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 3, 2006, Nightingale Acquisition Limited, a private limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., agreed to purchase 9,790,280 shares, or 3.8% of the issued share capital, of the London Stock Exchange plc, at a price of GBP 12.18 per share, from Wellington Management Company, LLP or its affiliates. The total consideration represents approximately GBP 119.2 million, or $220.7 million, based on an exchange rate of 1.85 U.S. Dollars per British Pound as of May 4, 2006. Nasdaq paid for the shares with cash on hand.
Wellington Management beneficially owns approximately 15.5 million shares, or 13.9% of the issued common stock, of Nasdaq. The share purchase was made in an ordinary market transaction with the terms determined through arms-length negotiation between the parties.
This share purchase brings Nasdaq's holding in the LSE to 47,890,280 shares, or 18.7% of the issued share capital, of the LSE.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
