Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 10, 2006, Nightingale Acquisition Limited, a private limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., agreed to purchase 13,791,440 shares, or approximately 5.4% of the issued share capital, of the London Stock Exchange plc, at a price of GBP 12.48 per share. The total consideration represents approximately GBP 172.1 million, or $321.4 million, based on an exchange rate of 1.87 U.S. Dollars per British Pound as of May 10, 2006. Nasdaq agreed to purchase 10,291,440 of the LSE shares from UBS AG, and agreed to purchase the balance from other LSE shareholders. Nasdaq completed these share purchases on May 15, 2006.
Daniel Coleman, a member of Nasdaq's board of directors, is also the Joint Global Head of Equities at UBS Securities LLC, a broker-dealer subsidiary of UBS AG. All of the shares were purchased in ordinary market transactions with the terms determined through arms-length negotiation between the parties.
Nasdaq paid for these share purchases using $310.1 million available under its credit facility with affiliates of Bank of America, which became effective on April 18, 2006 and $11.3 million from cash on hand. The terms and conditions of the Bank of America credit facility are described in Nasdaq's Form 8-K, filed on April 17, 2006, and that description is incorporated herein by reference.
These share purchases bring Nasdaq's holding in the LSE to 61,681,720 shares, or approximately 24.1% of the issued share capital of the LSE.
