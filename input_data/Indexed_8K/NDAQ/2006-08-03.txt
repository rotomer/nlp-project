Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. entered into a Letter Agreement with Anna Ewing, its Executive Vice President  Operations & Technology and Chief Information Officer, effective as of July 28, 2006. The Letter Agreement provides enhanced severance benefits upon termination in connection with a change in control of Nasdaq. The Letter Agreement was approved by Nasdaq's Board of Directors, and the terms of the Letter Agreement were previously disclosed on Nasdaq's Form 8-K dated February 9, 2005. That description is incorporated by reference into this Form 8-K. The Letter Agreement contains substantially the same terms and conditions as the revised letter agreements that Nasdaq entered into with six other executive officers, effective as of March 23, 2005, which were previously disclosed on Nasdaq's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, filed on May 10, 2005.
A copy of the Letter Agreement is filed herewith and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
At a special meeting of stockholders held on September 14, 2005, Nasdaq's stockholders approved amendments to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The amendments were scheduled to take effect upon the implementation of the registration of our wholly owned subsidiary, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, as a national securities exchange, which occurred on August 1, 2006. As a result, we filed the amendments with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and they were effective as of August 1, 2006. The text of the amendments was included as Annex C to our definitive proxy statement filed on August 22, 2005.
On August 5, 2005, Nasdaq's board of directors approved amendments to Nasdaq's By-Laws that were generally intended to recognize Nasdaq's status as the parent company of a national securities exchange and make conforming changes. The By-Law amendments also took effect upon the implementation of the registration of our exchange subsidiary as a national securities exchange on August 1, 2006. Both the amendments to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our By-Laws were approved by the SEC.
Specifically, the By-Law amendments delete provisions that are more appropriate to include in the By-Laws of our exchange subsidiary and add other provisions that are designed to maintain the independence of the exchange's self-regulatory function from Nasdaq, enable the exchange to operate in a manner that complies with the federal securities laws and facilitate the ability of the exchange and the SEC to fulfill their regulatory and oversight obligations under the Exchange Act. For example, the By-Law amendments provide, among other things, that:
 
 
 
 
 
The text of the amended and restated By-Laws is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.2.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Act and the rules thereunder (and such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock

Ms. Anna M. Ewing
[Address]
Dear Anna:
As you may be aware, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("") has recently approved a new policy to provide enhanced severance payments and benefits to all Nasdaq Executive Vice Presidents in the event of certain terminations of employment connected with a change in control of Nasdaq. This letter agreement sets forth your rights under the new policy.
Nasdaq
Payments and benefits provided by this letter agreement are in lieu of any payments or benefits to which you may be entitled under any other Nasdaq severance program. Furthermore, this is not a contract of employment and nothing contained herein shall confer on you any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee, consultant or officer of Nasdaq or any of its affiliates (the ""), and you shall remain an employee-at-will.
Companies
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur (i) as a result of the redemption of Series D Preferred Stock of Nasdaq held by NASD upon the Securities Exchange Commission's approval of Nasdaq's application for registration as a national securities exchange pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Exchange Act or (ii) any other transaction or event which causes the reduction in the Voting Securities held by the NASD below 50% which would not otherwise constitute a Change in Control pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) above.

Other than as provided in this Section 2(c), options and restricted stock awards shall continue to be subject to the applicable terms of the Equity Plan and the agreements pursuant to which they were granted.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
circumstances that would have constituted a Qualifying Termination if they had occurred following a Change in Control; (ii) you reasonably demonstrate that such termination (or Good Reason event) was at the request of a third party who had indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control; and (iii) a Change in Control involving such third party (or a party competing with such third party to effectuate a Change in Control) does occur (""), then, contingent upon your execution of a release substantially in the form annexed hereto as in favor of the Companies, you shall be entitled to the payments and benefits set forth in this Section 3.
Anticipatory Termination
Exhibit A
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are terminated by Nasdaq without Cause, and such termination is not an Anticipatory Termination or does not occur within the 12 months following a Change in Control, then Nasdaq's regular severance policy (""), including health benefit continuation, shall apply in lieu of this Section 3. If any such termination is later deemed an Anticipatory Termination, the terms of this Section 3 shall apply, but the payments and benefits provided in this Section 3 shall be offset and reduced for any payments or benefits you have already received under the Regular Severance Policy.

Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provision of this letter agreement or any such agreement or plan, if by reason of the operation of said Section 280G, any such payments or benefits exceed the amount which can be deducted by Nasdaq, such payments or benefits shall be reduced to the maximum amount which can be deducted by Nasdaq. To the extent that there is more than one method of reducing the payments or benefits to bring them within the limitations of said Section 280G, Nasdaq shall determine which method shall be followed.
