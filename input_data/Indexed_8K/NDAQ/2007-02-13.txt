Exhibit 99.1
 
New York, N.Y.The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ
"; Nasdaq: NDAQ), today reported fourth quarter 2006 net income of $63.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, an increase of $45.9 million from $17.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005, and an increase of $32.8 million from $30.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
Net income for the full year 2006 was $127.9 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, versus net income of $61.7 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the full year 2005. Included in fourth quarter 2006 net income is a $29.4 million gain, net of tax, on foreign currency option contracts purchased to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the acquisition bid for the London Stock Exchange. This gain had the impact of increasing diluted earnings per share by $0.19 in the quarter.
Operating income was $68.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $34.9 million, or 105.1% when compared to $33.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, and up slightly from $67.9 million for the third quarter 2006. Operating income for the full year was $214.1 million, an increase of 88.3% when compared to $113.7 million for the full year 2005.
Gross margin, representing total revenues less cost of revenues, was $183.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 32.1% from $138.6 million in the year-ago period, and up 7.0% from $171.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2006. Gross margin for the full year 2006 was $687.4 million, an increase of 30.7% from $526.0 million in 2005.
"Our strong financial results point to the success that we achieved in 2006," commented NASDAQ's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greifeld. "During the year we began operations as a national securities exchange, completed the migration of Nasdaq-listed stocks to a single trading platform, increased our share of U.S. equity trading and initial public offerings, and continued to increase the value proposition for listing on NASDAQ by offering more products and services."
Mr. Greifeld concluded, "We enter 2007 with a stronger core business that will support our new growth initiatives to increase revenue and profitability. We plan to achieve this by gaining market share and through new initiatives such as our planned options exchange and Portal market."

NASDAQ's Chief Financial Officer, David Warren, commented: "During the year we continued to demonstrate our ability to effectively integrate acquisitions while driving innovation and growth in our core businesses.

Total Expenses
Total expenses increased 9.1% to $115.0 million from $105.4 million in the year-ago quarter and increased 11.3% from $103.3 million in the prior quarter. Fourth quarter 2006 expenses increased from last year primarily due to the recent acquisitions of INET, Shareholder.com, and PrimeNewswire. Expenses increased from third quarter 2006 primarily due to the integration of PrimeNewswire, higher marketing and advertising spending, and higher professional services costs, offset somewhat by lower depreciation expenses.
Gain on Foreign Currency Option Contracts
Included in non-operating income in the fourth quarter 2006 is an unrealized pre-tax gain of $48.4 million ($29.4 million net of tax) on foreign currency option contracts purchased to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the acquisition bid for The London Stock Exchange. This gain had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by $0.19 in the quarter and $0.20 for the year. In conjunction with the lapse of our final offer for The London Stock Exchange, NASDAQ traded out of these foreign exchange contracts. Due to the improving exchange rate of the dollar when compared to the pound sterling, NASDAQ will be recording a pre-tax loss of approximately $7.8 million on these foreign currency option contracts in first quarter 2007 results. The cumulative realized pre-tax gain on the foreign currency option contracts is approximately $40.6 million.
Dividend Income
Included in non-operating income in the fourth quarter and full year 2006 is dividend income of $7.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, representing ordinary dividends declared by the London Stock Exchange during 2006.
Earnings Per Share
As stated above, fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.43 versus $0.15 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter and $0.22 in the third quarter of 2006. NASDAQ's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 152.1 million in the quarter versus 122.5 million in the year-ago quarter and 150.8 million in the third quarter 2006. The outstanding share count increased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the issuance of approximately 26.5 million shares in equity offerings in the first and second quarters of 2006.
