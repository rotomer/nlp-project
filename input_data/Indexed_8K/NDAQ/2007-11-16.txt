On November 15, 2007, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") entered into a definitive agreement (the "OMX Transaction Agreement") with Borse Dubai Limited ("Borse Dubai") and BD Stockholm AB (the "Bidder") regarding Nasdaq's and Borse Dubai's pending offers for OMX AB (publ) ("OMX") and Borse Dubai's investment in Nasdaq. On November 15, 2007, Nasdaq also entered into a definitive agreement (the "DIFX Transaction Agreement") with Borse Dubai and Dubai International Financial Exchange ("DIFX") regarding Nasdaq's investment in DIFX.
OMX Transaction Agreement
Terms and Conditions
In the OMX Transaction Agreement, Nasdaq and Borse Dubai have each agreed not to open their respective offers for OMX for acceptances while they seek regulatory and shareholder approval for the transactions contemplated by the OMX Transaction Agreement and the DIFX Transaction Agreement (the "Transactions"). While the OMX Transaction Agreement is in effect, the offer by Borse Dubai (the "Borse Dubai Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of OMX (the "OMX Shares") will open for acceptances upon the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions, which we refer to as the Conditions, by the beneficiary of such conditions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following the satisfaction of the Conditions, Nasdaq is obligated to withdraw its offer to acquire all of the outstanding OMX shares. Pursuant to the OMX Transaction Agreement, Nasdaq and Borse Dubai are obligated to cooperate in the conduct of their offers for OMX. The Transactions can be terminated if the Conditions have not been satisfied by February 15, 2008, or if the Borse Dubai Offer has not closed by April 15, 2008. Closing of the transactions contemplated by the OMX Transaction Agreement is also conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions by the beneficiary of such conditions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The condition of the Borse Dubai Offer pertaining to the minimal level of acceptances has been reduced to more than 50% of the outstanding OMX Shares. However, Nasdaq is permitted to terminate its agreements with Borse Dubai if less than 67% of the outstanding OMX Shares are tendered into the Borse Dubai Offer and delivered by Borse Dubai to Nasdaq.
Following the closing of the Borse Dubai Offer, Borse Dubai is obligated to cause its subsidiary currently holding agreements with various counter-parties pursuant to which Borse Dubai has the option to purchase 24.2% of OMX's share capital (the "Borse Dubai Option Agreements") to exercise all of these agreements. Thereafter, Borse Dubai is required to sell, and to cause any of its subsidiaries to sell, to Nasdaq all OMX Shares then owned by Borse Dubai and any of its subsidiaries, however acquired. Concurrent with Borse Dubai's delivery of OMX Shares, Nasdaq will pay to Borse Dubai up to SEK 12,582,952,392 in cash and deliver approximately 42 million shares of Nasdaq Common Stock (the exact number of shares will be equal to 19.99% of Nasdaq's fully-diluted outstanding stock as of such date). The amount of cash delivered by Nasdaq will be reduced by SEK 265 for each issued and outstanding OMX Share as of such date not delivered to Nasdaq by Borse Dubai.
As additional consideration for the delivery of shares of OMX to Nasdaq by Borse Dubai, Nasdaq shall deliver approximately 18 million shares of its common stock to be deposited in a trust (the "Trust") for the benefit of Borse Dubai and to be managed by an independent trustee. In total, 60,561,515 shares of Nasdaq Common Stock will be issued to Borse Dubai and the Trust.
The parties have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to secure regulatory approvals for the transactions contemplated by the OMX Transaction Agreement, except that Borse Dubai will not be required to accept any condition imposed by any regulator that Borse Dubai, in its reasonable judgment, deems materially adverse to its investment in Nasdaq, including any condition that would prevent Borse Dubai from obtaining equity accounting treatment for its investment in Nasdaq, but after Borse Dubai takes into account possible alternative arrangements that the parties agree to negotiate in good faith.
 
Representations and Warranties
The OMX Transaction Agreement contains representations and warranties the parties made to each other. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the OMX Transaction Agreement and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the OMX Transaction Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what may be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.

Section 5.02
Conduct of the Bidder Offer.
(a) Except as provided in this Agreement, from the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Borse Dubai shall cause the Bidder not to, and the Bidder shall not, open the Bidder Offer for acceptances. The foregoing notwithstanding, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the Conditions Precedent to the Trigger Date as set forth in Section 6.01, Borse Dubai shall cause the Bidder to, and the Bidder shall, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, open the Bidder Offer for acceptances as promptly as practicable after the Trigger Date and accept for payment all OMX Shares validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) pursuant to the Bidder Offer.
(b) In accordance with the terms of the Bidder Offer, the Bidder shall (and Borse Dubai shall cause the Bidder to) pay for all the OMX Shares acquired pursuant to the Bidder Offer. Following the Trigger Date, the obligation of the Bidder under this Agreement to accept for payment and pay for any OMX Shares validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) pursuant to the Bidder Offer shall be subject to the continuing satisfaction or waiver of the Conditions Precedent to the Closing as set forth on Exhibit A.
(c) Except as set forth on Exhibit A, the Parties agree to participate jointly and by mutual agreement in all decisions regarding the conduct of the Bidder Offer (including any increase in the offer price).

The satisfaction or waiver of any Condition Precedent shall, to the extent the corresponding Bidder Offer Condition is not satisfied, be a waiver of such Bidder Offer Condition. The satisfaction or wavier of any Bidder Offer Condition shall, to the extent the corresponding Condition Precedent is not actually satisfied, be deemed satisfaction of such Condition Precedent.

(b) Except in the case of fraud, or with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief or other equitable remedies are appropriate or available, the respective rights to indemnification as provided for in this Section 8.04 will constitute each Party's sole remedy and no Party will have any other liability or damages to any other Party; , , that nothing contained herein will prevent the Indemnified Person from pursuing remedies as may be available to such Party under applicable law in the event of an Indemnifying Person's failure to comply with its indemnification obligations hereunder.
