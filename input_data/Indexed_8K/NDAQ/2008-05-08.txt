May 8, 2008
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ OMX Group ("NASDAQ OMX"; NASDAQ: NDAQ), today reported first quarter 2008 net income of $121.4 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, an increase of $103.1 million from $18.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007. These results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and include the financial results of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") for the full quarter, and the financial results of OMX AB ("OMX") from February 27, 2008, when the business combination between NASDAQ and OMX closed. The comparative results for 2007 reflect the financial results of NASDAQ only.
"We are a new company and our opportunities for growth have never been stronger," stated Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer of NASDAQ OMX. "The completion of our historic combination with OMX establishes NASDAQ OMX as the world's largest exchange company with operations on six continents and an undisputed leader in product innovation. I am pleased to note that during the quarter we continued to build on our position as the largest U.S. equities exchange, yet also took steps to diversify into exciting opportunities with significant potential for earnings growth. These include the successful launch of our U.S. options market, progress on the proposed acquisition of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, our Pan-European Market, the investment in Dubai International Financial Exchange ("DIFX"), and our planned transaction with Nord Pool. We are executing well on the integration of OMX and continue to feel confident about achieving the synergies announced with the merger."
On a non-GAAP basis, when excluding certain one-time gains and merger related expenses, first quarter 2008 net income was $85.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share.
For comparison purposes pro forma non-GAAP results are being presented that reflect the financial results of both NASDAQ and OMX as if they were a combined company for the periods presented. For the first quarter of 2008 net income on a pro forma non-GAAP basis was $113.9 million, or $0.54 per diluted share (which excludes the $26.0 million pre-tax gain on the investment in DIFX), an increase when compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $68.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2007, and an increase when compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $103.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2007. The remaining results are presented on a pro forma non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.
Total revenues were $918.2 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 29.5% from $709.1 million in the year-ago period, and up 10.4% from $832.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007.

"During the first quarter, our business continued to operate efficiently and effectively, punctuated by strong operating performance, successful integration efforts and our ongoing disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet," said Chief Financial Officer David Warren. "In fact, based on the good start to the year and the better than expected results experienced in the roll out of our new technology road map, we are raising our expectations for fourth quarter 2008 synergy achievement to $25.0 million to $35.0 million in annual savings from $20 million to $30 million expected previously. We are pleased with the results so far and recognize that this is the product of the hard work of our team members world wide."
Financial Review
Results are presented on a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("Net Exchange Revenues") were $382.7 million for the first quarter of 2008, an increase of $43.5 million, or 12.8%, from the first quarter of 2007, and an increase of $3.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2007.
NASDAQ OMX presents for this quarter net exchange revenues along three primary business segments: Market Services, Issuer Services, and Market Technology.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues increased to $267.2 million, up 17.6% from the prior year quarter, and up 9.3% from the fourth quarter of 2007.
Execution Services
Execution Services net exchange revenues were $192.8 million for the first quarter of 2008, up $31.4 million, or 19.5%, when compared to the first quarter of 2007, and up $21.8 million, or 12.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
 
Market Services Subscriptions
Market Services Subscriptions (Market Data) revenues were $66.3 million for the first quarter of 2008, up $8.2 million, or 14.1%, when compared to the first quarter of 2007, and up $0.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
 
Issuer Services
During the first quarter of 2008 Issuer Services revenues increased 8.3% to $86.2 million from the first quarter of 2007 and decreased 6.6%, or $6.1 million, from the prior quarter.
Corporate Client Group
Corporate Client Group revenues were $74.7 million for the first quarter of 2008, up $4.0 million, or 5.7%, when compared to the first quarter of 2007, but down $6.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
 
Financial Products
Financial Products revenues were $11.5 million for the first quarter of 2008, up $2.6 million, or 29.2%, from the first quarter of 2007, and down $0.1 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase from the prior year quarter is due to higher license revenues associated with NASDAQ-licensed ETFs.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $29.0 million for the first quarter of 2008 compared to $31.9 million in the first quarter of 2007 and $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Declines when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 are due partly to higher than normal activity recognized in that period. Also, first quarter 2008 sales declined temporarily as anticipated as some customers chose to further review investment decisions in light of the integration of NASDAQ and OMX technology customer platforms and the creation of a common technology road-map. Customer activity continued to be high with large orders driving order intake to $46.7 million for the first quarter of 2008, 16.2% higher than the $40.2 million realized in the first quarter of 2007.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses increased 5.1% to $229.4 million from $218.3 million in the prior year quarter and declined 2.0% from $234.1 million in the prior quarter. Higher expenses when compared to the first quarter of 2007 are driven primarily by higher compensation expenses resulting from a larger employee base and increased retention expenses. Also contributing to higher expenses are lower exchange rates for the U.S. dollar as compared to the Swedish Krona. Declining expenses when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 are driven by lower marketing expenses, as the fourth quarter is typically a strong period for advertising.
Net Interest Income
Net interest expense was $11.3 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared with net interest expense of $21.1 million for the first quarter of 2007. The decline in net interest expense is primarily due to lower average net debt, lower interest rates, and higher cash balances in the most recent quarter.
Earnings Per Share
First quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.54 versus $0.33 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, and $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2007. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share were 214.1 million in the first quarter of 2008 versus 212.4 million in the year-ago quarter and 214.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
