EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
August 6, 2008
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ OMX Group ("NASDAQ OMX"; NASDAQ: NDAQ), today reported second quarter 2008 net income of $101.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, an increase of $45.5 million from $56.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007.
For comparison purposes net income and dilutive earnings per share for the second quarter of 2008 are presented on a non-GAAP basis and exclude merger expenses and gains from foreign currency contracts. Net income and dilutive earnings per share for earlier periods are presented on a pro-forma, non-GAAP basis that reflect the financial results of both NASDAQ and OMX as if they were a combined company for the periods presented and exclude merger expenses, gains (losses) from foreign currency contracts, and capital gains from shares in equity investments. For the second quarter of 2008 net income on a non-GAAP basis was $101.8 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, an increase when compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $77.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income also increased when compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $96.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2008. The remaining results are presented on a pro forma basis unless otherwise noted.
Total revenues were $821.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $380.2 million for the second quarter of 2008, an increase of $43.9 million, or 13.1%, from the second quarter of 2007, and a slight decrease of $1.3 million, or 0.3% from the first quarter of 2008.
"NASDAQ OMX delivered solid results during the quarter on the strength of our diversified business model," commented Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer for NASDAQ OMX. "We've made excellent progress on the integration of OMX and now expect this transaction to accrete in first quarter of 2009, significantly ahead of schedule. Driving this acceleration is our confidence in realizing the $100 million expense synergy target by the first anniversary of closing the deal. And the integration of our most recent acquisition, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, is also well underway and is expected to accrete to our shareholders by the end of 2008. As always, we will continue to follow our long-standing operating philosophy of leveraging massive scale against the extreme efficiency of our core technology."
Recent Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"When looking at our results on a pro-forma non-GAAP basis, we delivered strong net income growth both sequentially and year-over-year," said David Warren, NASDAQ OMX's Chief Financial Officer. "Our integration with OMX is moving forward better than expected and the integration of PHLX is well underway despite closing the transaction only two weeks ago. These integrations, coupled with the planned acquisitions of the Boston Stock Exchange and certain assets of Nord Pool, provide us with a platform to drive continued efficiencies and improved performance this year and well into 2009 and beyond."

Market Data
Market Data revenues were $87.1 million for the second quarter of 2008, up $9.6 million, or 12.4%, when compared to the second quarter of 2007, and up $3.9 million, or 4.7% from the first quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Issuer Services
During the second quarter of 2008 Issuer Services revenues increased 2.5%, or $2.1 million, to $87.6 million from the second quarter of 2007 and 1.6%, or $1.4 million, from the prior quarter.
Listing Services
Listing Services revenues were $76.7 million for the second quarter of 2008, up $2.0 million, or 2.7%, when compared to both the second quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. Increases in revenues from prior periods are driven primarily by higher customer demand for corporate services provided by PrimeNewswire, Shareholder.com, Carpenter Moore Insurance, and Directors Desk.
Financial Products
Financial Products revenues were $10.9 million for the second quarter of 2008, up slightly when compared to the second quarter of 2007, but down $0.6 million when compared to the first quarter of 2008. The decline from the first quarter of 2008 is primarily due to lower license revenues associated with NASDAQ-licensed products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $38.7 million for the second quarter of 2008, an increase of $10.2 million, or 35.8%, when compared to $28.5 million in the second quarter of 2007 and an increase of $7.6 million, or 24.4%, when compared to $31.1 million in the first quarter of 2008. Revenue increases when compared to prior periods reflect new projects and increased demand for licensed products, technology support, and facilities management services.
 
 
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses increased 9.6%, or $19.7 million, to $225.4 million from $205.7 million in the prior year quarter and 4.3%, or $9.3 million from $216.1 million in the prior quarter. Higher expenses were driven primarily by higher compensation expenses due to increases in accrued incentive compensation and higher amortized expenses associated with equity grants made to former OMX employees. Also contributing to higher costs in the current period were additional merger expenses. Somewhat offsetting these increases were declines in depreciation and amortization, reduced spending for professional and contract services and general and administrative expenses.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $12.9 million for the second quarter of 2008, compared with $17.6 million for the second quarter of 2007 and $17.8 million for the first quarter of 2008. The decline in net interest expense is primarily due to lower interest rates.
Dividend and Investment Income
Dividend and investment income was $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2008, up $0.4 million from the second quarter of 2007, and up $1.2 million when compared to the first quarter of 2008. Dividend and investment income for the quarter includes an ordinary dividend received on an investment in our available-for-sale portfolio.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP pro forma basis, second quarter 2008 earnings per diluted share were $0.48 versus $0.38 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, and $0.45 in the first quarter of 2008. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share were 214.4 million in the second quarter of 2008 versus 212.5 million in the year-ago quarter and 214.1 million in the first quarter of 2008.
