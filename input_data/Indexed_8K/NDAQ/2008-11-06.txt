Exhibit 99.1
November 6, 2008
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. ("NASDAQ OMX"; NASDAQ: NDAQ) today reported third quarter 2008 net income of $60.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with net income of $365.0 million, or $2.41 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007. Included in third quarter 2007 results was a pre-tax gain of $431.4 million associated with NASDAQ's sale of its share capital of the London Stock Exchange Group plc, which had the impact of increasing diluted earnings per share by $1.95.
For comparison purposes pro forma non-GAAP results are being presented that reflect the financial results of both NASDAQ OMX and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange as if we were a combined company for the periods presented and exclude certain non-operational items. Items excluded from third quarter 2008 results are:
 
 
 
 
For the third quarter of 2008, net income on a pro forma non-GAAP basis was $109.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, an increase of 27.7% when compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $85.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2007, and an increase of 7.2% when compared to pro forma non-GAAP net income of $102.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2008.
The remaining results are presented on a pro forma basis unless otherwise noted.
Total revenues were $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $410.6 million for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of $26.4 million, or 6.9%, from the third quarter of 2007, and a decrease of $9.7 million, or 2.3%, from the second quarter of 2008.
"During the quarter we continued with our ongoing mission to leverage massive scale against extreme efficiencies, building a global business to be successful in all economic environments," commented Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer of NASDAQ OMX. "All of the steps taken, including the acquisitions of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange, as well as the launch of NASDAQ OMX Europe, are designed to further diversify our product offerings while utilizing the same efficient platform. In many ways, NASDAQ OMX has never been better positioned to deliver value to our customers and long term returns for our shareholders as we redefine the role of the global exchange company."

"We continue to deliver strong operating results," said David Warren, NASDAQ OMX's Chief Financial Officer. "Our integration efforts are moving forward well ahead of schedule. The $100 million in expense synergies resulting from the combination with OMX are now expected to be achieved in the fourth quarter this year, up from the original estimate of year-end 2009, and up from the first quarter of 2009 target that we communicated last quarter. And the integration of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange is far ahead of schedule as the deal accreted to shareholders this quarter."
Financial Review
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues increased to $299.4 million, up 10.2% from the prior year quarter and up 2.3% from the second quarter of 2008.
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $183.7 million for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of $20.1 million, or 12.3%, when compared to the third quarter of 2007. Net exchange revenues increased $7.4 million, or 4.2%, from the second quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $87.5 million for the third quarter of 2008, up $5.5 million, or 6.7%, when compared to the third quarter of 2007, but down $0.9 million, or 1.0%, from the second quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
Issuer Services
During the third quarter of 2008, Issuer Services revenues declined $1.9 million, or 2.2%, to $85.1 million from the third quarter of 2007 and declined $2.5 million, or 2.9%, from the prior quarter.
Listing Services
Listing Services revenues were $72.4 million for the third quarter of 2008, down $2.8 million, or 3.7%, when compared to the third quarter of 2007 and down $4.3 million, or 5.6%, from the second quarter of 2008. Decreases in revenues from prior periods are driven primarily by lower market capitalization values for European listed equities, which in turn resulted in a decline in European listing fees of $2.3 million when compared to the third quarter of 2007 and $3.6 million when compared to the second quarter of 2008.
 
Financial Products
Financial Products revenues were $12.7 million for the third quarter of 2008, up 7.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2007, and up 16.5% when compared to the second quarter of 2008. Driving the increase in revenues is higher license fees associated with NASDAQ-licensed products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $24.9 million for the third quarter of 2008, equal to revenues recognized in the third quarter of 2007, but down $13.8 million, or 35.7%, when compared to the second quarter of 2008. Revenue declines when compared to the second quarter of 2008 are due to seasonally lower demand for licensed products, technology support and facilities management services.
Operating Expenses
When presented on a pro forma non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses decreased $4.7 million, or 2.1%, to $222.0 million from $226.7 million in the prior year quarter and $30.4 million, or 12.0%, from $252.4 million in the prior quarter. The decrease in expenses was driven primarily by lower compensation expenses, declines in professional and contract services, and reduced general and administrative expenses. Somewhat offsetting these declines are higher marketing and occupancy expenses and spending on new initiatives.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $19.0 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared with $31.2 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $20.6 million for the second quarter of 2008. The decline in net interest expense is primarily due to lower interest rates.
Earnings Per Share
On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, third quarter 2008 earnings per diluted share were $0.52 versus $0.42 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, and $0.48 in the second quarter of 2008. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share were 214.2 million in the third quarter of 2008 versus 212.8 million in the year-ago quarter and 214.4 million in the second quarter of 2008.
