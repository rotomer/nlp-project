On January 12, 2010, The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. ("NASDAQ OMX") issued a press release announcing the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of senior notes. The previously announced $700 million transaction was upsized to $1 billion, including $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2015 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.55% Senior Notes due 2020. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
As a result of the increase in size of the senior notes offering, NASDAQ OMX intends to reduce the size of its previously announced new senior unsecured credit facilities from $1,250 million of available borrowings to $950 million of which $700 million will be a funded term loan and $250 million will be an unfunded revolver. NASDAQ OMX expects that borrowings under the senior unsecured credit facilities will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00%.
