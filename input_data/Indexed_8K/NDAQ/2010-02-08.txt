("NASDAQ OMX"; NASDAQ: NDAQ) today reported net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $43 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $60 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009, and net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $35 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Excluding the above items net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX calculated on a non-GAAP basis was $99 million, compared with non-GAAP net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $89 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.

"We've accomplished much in the past year, completing our integration efforts and furthering the diversity of our revenue model through growth in market technology, in European derivative trading, and in fee based services," commented Bob Greifeld, NASDAQ OMX's Chief Executive Officer. "Today we are a more efficient operator with better financial flexibility, placing us in a strong position to lever our expertise in trading technology, clearing, data distribution, and corporate services.

"The strong cash flow of our diverse business model recently provided us with an opportunity to refinance our outstanding credit facility at extremely favorable terms," noted Adena Friedman, Chief Financial Officer. "The terms of the new debt provide us with increased flexibility in our capital management decisions while reducing our interest rate exposure. Additionally, the recent upgrades of our debt ratings speak to our sound financial policy and to the fact that we delivered on the promises of our integration efforts and improved the efficiency of our operations. In 2010, our goal is to maintain this financial discipline while delivering growth to our shareholders. For the full year of 2010, our guidance for total operating expenses is to be in the range of $865 million to $885 million, including approximately $50 million in non-recurring costs."
Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $369 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $20 million, or 6%, from third quarter of 2009 results. Net exchange revenues decreased $34 million, or 8%, from fourth quarter of 2008 results.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $240 million, an increase of 4% from the third quarter of 2009, but a decrease of 14% from the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $150 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $11 million, or 8%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009, but a decrease of $30 million, or 17%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $83 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, up $4 million, or 5%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009, but down $2 million, or 2%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
Issuer Services
During the fourth quarter of 2009, Issuer Services revenues were $82 million, representing an increase of $1 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter, but a decrease of $3 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $72 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, up $1 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2009, but down $3 million, or 4%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009 is primarily due to higher market capitalization values for European listed equities, which in turn result in higher European listing fees. Decreases in revenues from the prior year period are due primarily to the fourth quarter of 2009 sale of Carpenter Moore, NASDAQ OMX's insurance brokerage business. Also contributing to the decline are lower U.S. annual renewal fees resulting from fewer listed companies.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $44 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, up $8 million, or 22%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009, and up $9 million, or 26%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenue increases are primarily due to the increased deliveries of market technology contracts. Also contributing to the increases are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar.
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses increased $7 million, or 4%, to $204 million from $197 million in the third quarter of 2009, but decreased $9 million, or 4%, from $213 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in expenses when compared to the third quarter of 2009 is primarily driven by higher compensation expense and increased marketing and advertising spending. The decrease in expenses from the fourth quarter of 2008 was realized through a reduction in compensation expense and lower general, administrative and other expense. These reductions were driven by successful integration efforts associated with NASDAQ's business combination with OMX and acquisition of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $23 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $28 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Included in interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 is $15 million in interest expense, $3 million of non-cash expense associated with accretion of 2.5% convertible notes, $3 million in non-cash debt amortization expenses, and $4 million in other related fees. Interest income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $3 million.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share were $0.46 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 in the third quarter of 2009 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 215
 
million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 215 million for the third quarter of 2009 and 214 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.
In June 2009, NASDAQ OMX filed an application for an advance tax ruling with the Swedish Tax Council for Advanced Tax Rulings. The application was filed to confirm whether certain interest expense is deductible for Swedish tax purposes under legislation that became effective on January 1, 2009. We expect to receive a favorable response from the Swedish Tax Council for Advance Tax Rulings. We recorded the Swedish tax benefit as described above in our condensed consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. For the full year of 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of $19 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. We expect to record recurring quarterly tax benefits of $4 million to $5 million with respect to this issue for the foreseeable future.
