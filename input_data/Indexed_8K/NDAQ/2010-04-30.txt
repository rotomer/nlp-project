April 30, 2010
New York, N.Y.The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. ("NASDAQ OMX"; NASDAQ: NDAQ) today reported net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $61 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2010 compared with net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $43 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009, and net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $94 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009.
Included in first quarter of 2010 results are:
 
 
Excluding the above items, net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX calculated on a non-GAAP basis was $92 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared with non-GAAP net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX of $99 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $102 million for the first quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share were $0.43 for the first quarter of 2010 compared with non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share of $0.46 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $0.48 for the first quarter of 2009.
"During the quarter we remained focused on executing our plan to leverage our world class technology platform while diversifying our product offering," commented Bob Greifeld, NASDAQ OMX's Chief Executive Officer. "With the launch of INET in the Nordics, positive developments in our interest rate swaps clearing business, and expansion of our efforts within energy commodities, the breadth of our business has grown substantially, placing NASDAQ OMX in a favorable position to capitalize on changes within our industry."

"The strength of our cash generative business permitted us to approve a $300 million share repurchase program while simultaneously committing to an acceleration of our debt retirement plans," stated Adena Friedman, Chief Financial Officer. "Following the announcement of our repurchase program we moved aggressively to execute on this plan. To date we've acquired 3.7 million shares with a total market value in excess of $76 million. Our financial goals for the year remain consistent, to deliver value to our shareholders by maintaining our financial discipline while exploring accretive capital management opportunities. Regarding expense guidance, we expect total operating expenses for the full year of 2010 to be in the range of $875 million to $890 million, including approximately $65 million in non-recurring costs."
Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $360 million for the first quarter of 2010, a decrease of $9 million, or 2%, from fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2009 results. Changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar had the impact of lowering revenues in the first quarter of 2010 by $4 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009; however, changes in exchange rates had the impact of increasing revenues by $15 million when compared to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $241 million, equal to fourth quarter of 2009 results, but a decrease of 7% from the first quarter of 2009.
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $155 million for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of $5 million, or 3%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, but a decrease of $12 million, or 7%, when compared to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $80 million for the first quarter of 2010, down $4 million, or 5%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, and down $2 million, or 2%, when compared to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Issuer Services
During the first quarter of 2010, Issuer Services revenues were $84 million, equal to revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, but reflecting an increase of $4 million, or 5%, when compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $72 million for the first quarter of 2010, down $2 million, or 3%, from the fourth quarter of 2009, but up $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
Global Index Group
Global Index Group revenues were $12 million for the first quarter of 2010, up $2 million, or 20%, from the fourth quarter of 2009, and up $3 million, or 33%, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Higher revenues when compared to both periods are primarily due to increases in asset sizes of licensed exchange traded funds ("ETF") as well as additional demand for new licensed ETFs and other financial products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $34 million for the first quarter of 2010, down $10 million, or 23%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, but up $5 million, or 17%, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Revenue declines from the fourth quarter of 2009 are primarily due to extraordinarily strong customer demand in the prior quarter for year-end change requests and upgrades. Also contributing to the decline are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar. Higher revenues when compared to the first quarter of 2009 are primarily due to increases in the delivery of customer orders now in production and for which revenue is now recognized. Order intake
 
 
 
also improved, increasing to $50 million in the first quarter of 2010, up from $9 million in the first quarter of 2009. Total order value, which represents the value of orders signed that have not been recognized as revenue, increased to $496 million in the first quarter of 2010, up from $340 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $3 million, or 1%, to $201 million from $204 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, but increased $7 million, or 4%, from $194 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in expenses when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily driven by lower compensation expense and marketing and advertising spending, offset by higher data center lease expenses. Also contributing to the decline are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of lowering expenses by $3 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in expenses from the first quarter of 2009 is primarily due to changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $11 million.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $23 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $22 million for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2009. Included in total interest expense for the first quarter of 2010 is $19 million in interest expense, reflecting nearly a full quarter of the refinancing of our debt. Also included is $4 million of non-cash expense associated with accretion of the 2.5% convertible notes, $1 million in non-cash debt amortization expenses, and $1 million in other related fees. Interest income for the first quarter of 2010 was $2 million.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, first quarter 2010 earnings per diluted share were $0.43 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.48 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 215 million for the first quarter of 2010 and for the fourth quarter of 2009, and 214 million for the first quarter of 2009.
In June 2009, NASDAQ OMX filed an application for an advance tax ruling with the Swedish Tax Council for Advanced Tax Rulings. The application was filed to confirm whether certain interest expense is deductible for Swedish tax purposes under legislation that became effective on January 1, 2009. We expect to receive a favorable response from the Swedish Tax Council for Advance Tax Rulings in the second quarter of 2010. We recorded the Swedish tax benefit as described above in our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a tax benefit of $5 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Since January 1, 2009, we have recorded a tax benefit of $23 million, or $.11 per diluted share.
