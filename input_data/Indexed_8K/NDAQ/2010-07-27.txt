Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer, NASDAQ OMX said:
"Our record-tying performance this quarter was driven by the strong fundamentals of our core business. Top-line growth within our transaction businesses was complemented by growing demand for co-location and listed company corporate services. During the quarter, we also saw an increase in the total number of listed companies on continued strength of the IPO market. These results demonstrate that our diversified business model is capable of
delivering solid results while simultaneously allowing us to pursue growth initiatives to drive our business forward."

Adena Friedman, Chief Financial Officer, said:
"The $200 million of share repurchases that we executed enabled us to buy back 10.0 million shares and deliver $0.02 EPS accretion to shareholders this quarter, and we remain committed to executing the remainder of the plan up to the $400 million authorized amount. Results for the second quarter demonstrate the scalability of our business as revenue growth drove expansion in operating income, while continued strong cash flows reflect the resilience of our model in a dynamic market environment."
Expense Guidance
Total operating expenses for the full year of 2010 are expected to be in the range of $870 million to $885 million, including approximately $60 million in non-recurring costs. Total operating expense guidance will be revised following the release of third quarter of 2010 results to incorporate the acquisition of SMARTS Group once the transaction has closed.
Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $390 million for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of $30 million, or 8%, from first quarter of 2010 and an increase of $23 million, or 6%, from second quarter of 2009 results. Changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar had the impact of lowering revenues in the second quarter of 2010 by $8 million when compared to the first quarter of 2010; however, changes in exchange rates had the impact of increasing revenues by $2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $270 million, up 12% when compared to first quarter of 2010 results and 10% when compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $186 million for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of $31 million, or 20%, when compared to the first quarter of 2010 and to the second quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $79 million for the second quarter of 2010, down $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the first quarter of 2010 and to the second quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
Issuer Services
Issuer Services revenues were $86 million, an increase of $2 million, or 2%, when compared to the first quarter of 2010, and an increase of $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $74 million for the second quarter of 2010, up $2 million, or 3%, from the first quarter of 2010, but down $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the second quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
Global Index Group
Global Index Group revenues were $12 million for the second quarter of 2010, equal to revenues in the first quarter of 2010, and up $2 million, or 20%, when compared to the second quarter of 2009. Higher revenues when compared to the prior year quarter are primarily due to increases in asset sizes of licensed exchange traded funds ("ETFs") as well as additional demand for new licensed ETFs and other financial products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $34 million for the second quarter of 2010, equal to revenues in the first quarter of 2010, but down $2 million, or 6%, when compared to the second quarter of 2009. Order intake for the second quarter was $12 million, up $2 million when compared to $10 million in the second quarter of 2009. Total order value, which represents the value of orders signed that have not yet been recognized as revenue, was $453 million in the second quarter of 2010, up from $315 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses increased $6 million, or 3%, to $207 million from $201 million in the first quarter of 2010, and increased $8 million, or 4%, from $199 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in expenses when compared to the first quarter of 2010 is primarily driven by higher compensation, marketing and advertising, professional and contract services, occupancy, and general and administrative expenses. Somewhat offsetting these increases is the impact of changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of lowering expenses by $5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2010. The increase in expenses from the second quarter of 2009 is primarily due to higher professional services, marketing and advertising, and occupancy expenses. Also contributing to the increase in expenses when compared to the second quarter of 2009 are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $2 million.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $24 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared with $23 million for the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009. Included in total
 
 
 
interest expense for the second quarter of 2010 is $19 million in interest expense, reflecting a full quarter of the refinancing of our debt. Also included is $4 million of non-cash expense associated with the accretion of senior and convertible notes, $2 million in non-cash debt amortization expenses, and $1 million in other related fees. Interest income for the second quarter of 2010 was $2 million.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, second quarter 2010 earnings per diluted share were $0.52 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.43 in the first quarter of 2010 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 209 million for the second quarter of 2010, 215 million for the first quarter of 2010, and 214 million for the second quarter of 2009.
In June 2009, NASDAQ OMX filed an application for an advance tax ruling with the Swedish Tax Council for Advanced Tax Rulings. The application was filed to confirm whether certain interest expense is deductible for Swedish tax purposes under legislation that became effective on January 1, 2009. In June 2010, we received a favorable response from the Swedish Tax Council for Advanced Tax Rulings in which all members of the Council agreed that such interest expense is deductible for Swedish tax purposes. The Swedish Tax Agency has recently appealed such ruling to the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. We expect the Supreme Administrative Court to agree with the ruling from the Swedish Council for Advanced Tax Rulings. Since we previously recorded the Swedish tax benefit, the outcome of this ruling resulted in no impact to our financial statements.
