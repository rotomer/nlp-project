Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer, NASDAQ OMX said:
"Despite lower industry trading volumes, we delivered exceptional results this quarter. This performance can be attributed to the success we've had in diversifying our business and identifying opportunities to deliver value-added products and services to our customers. The scale of the NASDAQ OMX business model leaves us well positioned to achieve our stated goal of generating annualized net revenue of $2 billion by the end of 2013."

Adena Friedman, Chief Financial Officer, said:
"In addition to our ability to innovate and execute our growth strategy, expense management continues to be a core competency as evidenced by our results this quarter. When adjusting for expenses associated with the SMARTS acquisition, our spending in the
 
 
 
third quarter of 2010 is on par with levels realized last year while net revenues increased. Our ability to achieve operational efficiencies has allowed us to continue to invest in new initiatives while expanding profit margins."
Expense Guidance
Total operating expenses for the full year of 2010 are expected to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million, including approximately $60 million in non-recurring costs.
Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less liquidity rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $372 million for the third quarter of 2010, a decrease of $18 million, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2010 and an increase of $23 million, or 7%, from the third quarter of 2009. Changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar had the impact of increasing revenues in the third quarter of 2010 by $5 million when compared to the second quarter of 2010; however, changes in exchange rates had the impact of decreasing revenues by $2 million when compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $249 million, down 8% when compared to the second quarter of 2010 results but up 8% when compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $168 million for the third quarter of 2010, a decrease of $18 million, or 10%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010, but an increase of $28 million, or 20%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $76 million for the third quarter of 2010, down $3 million, or 4%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010 and to the third quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Issuer Services
Issuer Services revenues were $85 million, a decrease of $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010, and an increase of $3 million, or 4%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $73 million for the third quarter of 2010, down $1 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2010, but up $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The decrease when compared to the second quarter of 2010 is primarily due to a modest decline in Corporate Services revenues, resulting from seasonally lower demand for services from listed companies. The increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009 is primarily due to higher European listing revenues resulting from higher market capitalization values for European listed equities.
Global Index Group
Global Index Group revenues were $12 million for the third quarter of 2010, equal to revenues in the second quarter of 2010, and up $2 million, or 20%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Higher revenues when compared to the prior year quarter are primarily due to increases in asset sizes of licensed exchange traded funds ("ETFs") as well as additional demand for new licensed ETFs and other financial products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $38 million for the third quarter of 2010, up $4 million, or 12%, from the second quarter of 2010, and up $2 million, or 6%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009. These increases primarily relate to the inclusion of revenue associated with SMARTS, which was acquired during the quarter.
 
 
 
 
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $4 million, or 2%, to $203 million in the third quarter of 2010 from $207 million in the second quarter of 2010, and increased $6 million, or 3%, from $197 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in expenses when compared to the second quarter of 2010 is primarily driven by lower compensation, professional and contract services, and computer operations and data communications expenses. Partially offsetting lower spending in the quarter is the impact of changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $3 million when compared to the second quarter of 2010, as well as additional expenses associated with SMARTS. The increase in expenses from the third quarter of 2009 is primarily due to costs associated with SMARTS and higher compensation expenses, partially offset by a reduction in expenses resulting from the sale of Carpenter Moore, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $23 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $24 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $23 million for the third quarter of 2009. Included in total net interest expense for the third quarter of 2010 is $19 million in interest expense, $4 million of non-cash expense associated with the accretion of senior and convertible notes, and $2 million in non-cash debt amortization expenses and other related fees. Interest income for the third quarter of 2010 was $2 million.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter 2010 earnings per diluted share were $0.50 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 in the second quarter of 2010 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 204 million for the third quarter of 2010, 209 million for the second quarter of 2010, and 215 million for the third quarter of 2009.
