The Supplemental Indenture relates to NASDAQ OMX's 5.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Senior Notes").

If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
(e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies

If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
 
10. .

11. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates, officers and directors of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

Section 2.2. .
Interest Rate Adjustment
(a) The interest rate payable on the Senior Notes shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody's or S&P, or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes, in the manner described below.
(b) If the rating from Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) of the Senior Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Senior Notes shall increase such that it shall equal the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
(c) If the rating from S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency) of the Senior Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Senior Notes shall increase such that it shall equal the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
 
(d) If at any time the interest rate on the Senior Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Senior Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Senior Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Senior Notes shall equal the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables in Sections 2.2(a) and (b) in effect immediately following the increase in rating. If Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) subsequently increases its rating of the Senior Notes to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, and S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Senior Notes will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date. In addition, the interest rate on the Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the Senior Notes become rated A3 and A- (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by each of Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), respectively (or by one rating agency in the event the Senior Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency and the Company has not obtained ratings from a Substitute Rating Agency).
(e) Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments; , , that in no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Senior Notes be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Senior Notes exceeds 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date.
provided
however
(f) No adjustments in the interest rate of the Senior Notes shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Senior Notes. If at any time Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Senior Notes for any reason, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Senior Notes from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Senior Notes pursuant to the tables above, (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Senior Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative rating scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Senior Notes will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency). For so long as only one of Moody's or S&P provides a rating of the Senior Notes and no Substitute Rating Agency is offered to replace the other Rating Agency, any subse-
 
quent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Senior Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Senior Notes, the interest rate on the Senior Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, as the case may be.
(g) Any interest rate increase or decrease described in this Section 2.2 will take effect on the next business day after the day on which the rating change has occurred.
(h) If the interest rate payable on the Senior Notes is increased as described above, the term "interest," as used with respect to the Senior Notes, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.

December 16, 2010
  The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. ("NASDAQ OMX") (Nasdaq:NDAQ  News) has agreed to repurchase from Borse Dubai approximately 22.78 million shares of common stock for $21.82 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $497 million, representing approximately 11.5% of its total outstanding shares. The transaction completes, expands and accelerates the purchase by NASDAQ OMX of its shares pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase plan.
New York, December 16, 2010
Borse Dubai also has agreed to sell in a private transaction 8 million shares of common stock of NASDAQ OMX to Nomura International PLC as the buyer under the NASDAQ OMX Sale agreement.
Nomura agreed, under a forward sale agreement, to sell 8 million shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock to Investor AB, subject to regulatory approval. To the extent the agreement is physically settled, Investor AB's ownership of NASDAQ OMX shares of common stock will increase to 17,400,142 shares.
The sale by Borse Dubai of slightly more than half of its investment in NASDAQ OMX (30.78 million shares) will raise substantial proceeds to meet Borse Dubai's debt obligations maturing in February 2011.
NASDAQ OMX intends to raise $370 million in the bond market to finance the transaction. NASDAQ OMX management is committed to maintaining its investment grade status with both S&P and Moody's.
Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer of NASDAQ OMX, said: "Our repurchase of shares from Borse Dubai is an excellent transaction for both parties. It allows us to be opportunistic and accelerate our share repurchase plans while delivering significant accretion to our shareholders. The financing gives us sufficient capacity to fund the buyback, while maintaining strategic and operational flexibility. After the transaction, Borse Dubai will continue to hold a significant investment in NASDAQ OMX, demonstrating its desire to remain a committed long-term shareholder. We are pleased by the confidence Investor AB has shown in NASDAQ OMX by increasing its holding to become a leading and engaged shareholder."
