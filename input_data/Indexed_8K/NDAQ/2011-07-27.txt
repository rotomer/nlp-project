Financial Highlights:
 
 
Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer and President, NASDAQ OMX said:
"NASDAQ OMX continues to deliver record earnings growth, proving the resiliency of our business model. This was accomplished with the strength of our top line as net revenues grew for the third consecutive quarter and are up 11% for the first half of the year when compared to the same period last year. With a sharp eye on execution we've achieved double digit growth in net revenues during a time when ongoing economic uncertainty has created a challenging environment for many of our volume related businesses. We are confident in our ability to continue growing the business organically and to effectively leverage the success which is borne out by our record financial performance."

Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, said:
"We are very pleased with our results this quarter as they mark another high point in NASDAQ OMX's track record of growing revenues and profits. This performance put us in a position to take another step in a long stated objective of ours, which is to reduce our outstanding debt obligations. Payments of $120 million this year have contributed to a significant reduction of our debt to EBITDA ratio, which has declined from 2.9x at the end of 2010 to 2.6x currently. Sustained strong cash flow will allow us to continue to deleverage and put us in a position to explore efficient capital allocation alternatives as the year progresses."
Expense Guidance
Total run rate operating expenses for the full year of 2011 are expected to be in the range of $910 million to $925 million, excluding approximately $40 million in merger related and other infrequent charges.
Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $416 million for the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $1 million from the first quarter of 2011 and an increase of $26 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2010. Changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar had the impact of increasing revenues in the second quarter of 2011 by $6 million when compared to the first quarter of 2011, and by $23 million when compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $277 million for the second quarter of 2011, down 1% when compared to the first quarter of 2011 results but up 3% when compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $189 million for the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of $6 million, or 3%, when compared to the first quarter of 2011, but an increase of $3 million, or 2%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $83 million for the second quarter of 2011, up $2 million, or 2%, when compared to the first quarter of 2011, and up $4 million, or 5%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
Issuer Services
Issuer Services revenues were $93 million for the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $2 million, or 2%, when compared to the first quarter of 2011, and an increase of $7 million, or 8%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $80 million for the second quarter of 2011, up $2 million, or 3%, when compared to the first quarter of 2011, and up $6 million, or 8%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010. The increase when compared to the first quarter of 2011 is due to higher Corporate Solutions revenues and an increase in European listing revenues. When compared to the prior year period, revenue growth is primarily due to increases in Corporate Solutions revenues, resulting from higher demand for services from listed companies, and increases in European listing revenues.
Global Index Group
Global Index Group revenues were $13 million for the second quarter of 2011, equal to revenues in the first quarter of 2011 and up $1 million, or 8%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010. Higher revenues when compared to the prior year period are primarily due to increases in asset sizes of licensed ETFs as well as additional demand for new licensed ETFs and other financial products.
 
 
 
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $46 million for the second quarter of 2011, up $3 million, or 7%, from the first quarter of 2011, and up $12 million, or 35%, when compared to the second quarter of 2010. The increase when compared to the first quarter of 2011 is due to higher demand for change requests and support services. Also contributing to the increase are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar. The increase when compared to the second quarter of 2010 is primarily due to the inclusion of revenue associated with SMARTS, which was acquired during the third quarter of 2010. Also contributing to the increase in revenues when compared to the second quarter of 2010 are revenues associated with recently delivered projects and changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar.
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses increased $6 million, or 3%, to $229 million in the second quarter of 2011 from $223 million in the first quarter of 2011, and increased $22 million, or 11%, from $207 million in the prior year quarter. The increase when compared to the first quarter of 2011 is primarily driven by the impact of changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $4 million when compared to the first quarter of 2011. Also contributing to the increase when compared to the first quarter of 2011 are higher compensation expenses. When compared to the second quarter of 2010, the increase is primarily due to higher expenses associated with FTEN (acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010), SMARTS (acquired in the third quarter of 2010), and Zoomvision Mamato (acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010). Also contributing to the increase are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $16 million.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $28 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $30 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $24 million for the second quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest expense when compared to the first quarter of 2011 is due primarily to lower outstanding debt obligations in the second quarter of 2011. The increase in net interest expense when compared to the second quarter of 2010 is due to the issuance of senior bonds in December of 2010 to partially finance the repurchase of shares. Included in total net interest expense for the second quarter of 2011 is $24 million in interest expense, $4 million of non-cash expense associated with the accretion of debt discounts, $2 million in debt issuance amortization expense, and $1 million of other bank-related fees. Interest income for the second quarter of 2011 was $3 million.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, second quarter 2011 earnings per diluted share were $0.62 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.61 in the first quarter of 2011 and
 
 
 
non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 181 million for the first and second quarters of 2011 and 209 million for the second quarter of 2010.
