2.03 Requests for Borrowings
(a) Each Borrowing (other than Borrowings of Swingline Loans with respect to which this Section 2.03 shall not apply), each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other,
 
and each continuation of Eurocurrency Loans shall be made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars or any conversion of ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans, (ii) four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, and (iii) one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of ABR Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $2,500,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing Request (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing of Term Loans or Revolving Loans, a conversion of Term Loans or Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the currency in which the Loans to be borrowed are to be denominated, (v) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans or Revolving Loans are to be converted, and (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Borrowing Request or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loans shall be made as, or converted to, ABR Loans (unless the Loan being made or continued is denominated in an Alternative Currency, in which case it shall be made or continued as a Eurocurrency Loan with an Interest Period of one month). Any such automatic conversion to ABR Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans in any such Borrowing Request, but fails to specify an Interest Period (or fails to give a timely notice requesting a continuation of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency), it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. If no currency is specified in a Borrowing Request, the requested Borrowing shall be in Dollars.
(b) Following receipt of a Borrowing Request, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of the amount (and currency) of its pro rata share of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to ABR Loans or continuation of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency described in Section 2.03(a). In the case of each Borrowing, each applicable Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent's Office for Dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day specified in the applicable Borrowing Request. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like
 
funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; that if, on the date a Borrowing Request with respect to a Borrowing of Revolving Loans is given by the Borrower, there are LC Borrowings or Swingline Loans outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such LC Borrowings, second, to the prepayment in full of any such Swingline Loans and third, to the Borrower as provided above.
provided
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Required Lenders may require that no Loans may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Loans.
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurocurrency Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that ABR Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the applicable Lenders of any change in the Administrative Agent's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.
(e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (b) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(f) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such
 
Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower any amounts previously paid by Borrower in respect of such Borrowing under this Section 2.03. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 2.04 .
Swingline Loans
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole discretion, make Swingline Loans to the Borrower in Dollars from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans exceeding $50,000,000 or (ii) the aggregate Revolving Exposures exceeding the aggregate Revolving Commitments, that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. All Swingline Loans shall be ABR Loans. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan.
provided
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender. Each such notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $500,000 (and any amount in excess of $500,000 shall be an integral multiple of $100,000), and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swingline Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any telephonic Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or any Lender prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swingline Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Borrower.
(c) (i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make an ABR Revolving Loan in
 
an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03 without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of ABR Revolving Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Borrowing Request promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Borrowing Request available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office for Dollar-denominated payments not later that 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Borrowing Request, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made an ABR Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender and such funds shall be applied to repay the applicable Swingline Loan.
(ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing of Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for ABR Revolving Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
(iii) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's ABR Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing of Revolving Loans or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If any Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following request by the Swingline Lender repay all then outstanding Swingline Loans.
(iv) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make ABR Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence
 
or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; , , that each Revolving Lender's obligation to make ABR Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
provided
however
(d) (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage therein in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender.
(ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.03 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e) The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender funds its ABR Revolving Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.
(f) The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.
(g) To the extent not previously refinanced under Section 2.04(c), Borrower shall repay each Swingline Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is ten Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date.

Unless the Issuing Bank has received written notice from the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Bank and such funds shall be applied to repay the applicable LC Disbursement.

In such event, each Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(a)(xi) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such LC Borrowing and shall constitute an LC Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.05.

(xiv) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or LC Advances to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements that are not reimbursed by the Borrower as set forth herein, as contemplated by this Section 2.05(a), shall be absolute and unconditional

No such making of an LC Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
provided
(xv) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(a) by the time specified in Section 2.05(a)(xi), the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.05(a)(xv) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(xvi) If any Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender following the issuance of any Letter of Credit, the Borrower will promptly deposit Cash Collateral with the Issuing Bank in an amount equal to such Defaulting Lender's Applicable Percentage of each outstanding Letter of Credit which Cash Collateral shall be held by the Issuing Bank to secure such Defaulting Lender's obligations to participate in such Letter of Credit (and, if any Cash Collateral remains following the return or expiration of such Letter of Credit, shall be returned to the Borrower promptly following such return or expiration).

(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate for any currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (1) any request pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the affected currency shall be ineffective and (2) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing shall be (I) for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, or (II) for a Borrowing of a Loan bearing interest at the Cost of Funds Rate plus the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in the case of any other Loan.

Increased Costs

interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

The written demand shall be made in a certificate setting forth the amount of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and, in reasonable detail, the calculation and basis for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt, if available, issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(ii) Each Lender that is a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:

Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered form or certification to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.
(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.
(vi) The Administrative Agent in its capacity as such shall, to the extent it is legally eligible to do so, from time to time deliver to the Borrower a properly executed copy of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY or W-9, as applicable.
(vii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of those sections (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the
 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under such Sections and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(f) If the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable expenses (including any Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
(g) The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower in attempting to recover any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes that the Borrower reasonably asserts were improperly imposed if (i) in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, such cooperation would not subject the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, to any unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise be materially disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, and (ii) based on written advice of the Borrower's independent accountants or external legal counsel delivered to such Administrative Agent or Lender, there is a reasonable basis for the Borrower to contest with the applicable Governmental Authority the imposition of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided, however, that any such attempts shall be at the sole cost of the Borrower and the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for any costs it incurs in connection with complying with this subsection 2.15(g). In such event, the applicable Administrative Agent or Lender shall only be required to pursue the applicable refund in a commercially reasonable manner, and at the Borrower's sole cost and expense. In no event will this Section 2.15(g) relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay any additional amounts or indemnification payments to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Section 2.15. Any refund obtained shall be repaid to the Borrower to the extent provided in Section 2.15(f).
SECTION 2.16 .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it under any Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Borrowings or LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior
 
to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Requirement of Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its pro rata (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's lending office.
(b) Subject to Section 2.16(e), if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Borrowings and LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Borrowings and LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Borrowings and LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) Subject to Section 2.16(e), if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans, LC Advances or participations in Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans, LC Advances and participations in Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans,
 
Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption and in its sole discretion, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(c), 2.03(b) or (g), 2.16(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.17 .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not be inconsistent with its internal policies or otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
 
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, LC Advances and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee or the Borrower, (iii) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 9.04(b) and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise (including as a result of any action taken by such Lender under paragraph (a) above), the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Additionally, at any time that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may elect to terminate the Commitment of such Lender so long as any resulting change in the Revolving Exposures as a result of such termination would not cause the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender to exceed the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender except in the case of any Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender that are then outstanding (in which case, the Borrower may only terminate the unused portion of such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment; that upon any prepayment of Revolving Loans by the Borrower following any such termination, the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall be prepaid as if its Revolving Commitment was as in effect at the time such Defaulting Lender became a Defaulting Lender).

SECTION 2.18 .
Incremental Revolving Commitments
(a) At any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request to increase the existing Revolving Commitments (""); that at the time of each such request and upon the effectiveness of each Incremental Facility Amendment, (A) no Default has occurred and is continuing or shall result therefrom, (B) the Borrower shall be in compliance on a Pro Forma Basis with the covenants contained in Sections 6.08 and 6.09 recomputed as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been or were required to be delivered pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 5.01, and (C) the Borrower shall have delivered a certificate of a Financial

Officer to the effect set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above, together with all calculations relevant thereto, including reasonably detailed calculations demonstrating compliance with clause (B) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the aggregate principal amount of the Incremental Revolving Commitments shall not exceed $250,000,000. Each exercise of the Borrower's right to seek Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $25,000,000.
(b) Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Revolving Commitments. Any additional bank, financial institution, existing Lender or other Person that elects to extend Incremental Revolving Commitments (any such bank, financial institution, existing Lender or other Person being called an "") shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, if not already a Lender, shall become a Lender under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an "") to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, such Additional Lender and the Administrative Agent. No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Revolving Commitment unless, in its sole discretion, it so agrees. An Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section (including to provide for voting provisions applicable to the Additional Lenders comparable to the provisions of clause (B) of the second proviso of Section 9.02(b)). The effectiveness of any Incremental Facility Amendment shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Additional Lenders, be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof (each, an "") of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (it being understood that all references to "the date of such Borrowing" in Section 4.02 shall be deemed to refer to the Incremental Facility Closing Date). The Administrative Agent shall receive not less than 10 Business Days' advance notice (or shorter, if agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior to any proposed Incremental Facility Closing Date.

If with respect to any determination of the Eurocurrency Rate the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that BBA LIBOR will not be available on a Quotation Day using Reuters or another commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR, the Administrative Agent shall promptly request that each Reference Bank supply it with its Quoted Rate, and the Eurocurrency Rate to be used to determine the interest rate applicable to the relevant Borrowing, conversion or continuation shall be the average of the Quoted Rates supplied to the Administrative Agent by the Reference Banks. If the Administrative Agent makes such request and one or more Reference Banks fails to supply its Quoted Rate to the Administrative Agent by 11:30 a.m., London time, on a Quotation Day, the applicable Eurocurrency Rate shall (subject to Section 2.12(b)) be determined on the basis of the Quoted Rates supplied by the remaining Reference Banks.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
The bank serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number
 
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary or believed by the such Agent in good faith to be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 2.05 or Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 2.05 or Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by The Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as The Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may resign at any time upon notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after such retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then such retiring Administrative
 
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent that shall be a bank with an office in the United States or an Affiliate of any such bank, that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) such retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After such Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as the Administrative Agent.
provided
Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, (ii) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.
Each Lender and the Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this any Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished thereunder.
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LC Exposure shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)
 
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to (a) file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC Exposures and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Issuing Bank under Sections 2.05(e) and 2.12) allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (b) collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 2.10.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or the Issuing Bank or in any such proceeding.
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender or the Issuing Bank an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender or the Issuing Bank failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective), such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.15 and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other reasonable expenses, whether or not such tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or the Issuing Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the Issuing Bank and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of any Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the institutions identified as an Arranger, Joint Bookrunning Manager or Syndication Agent on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under any Loan Document, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder.

The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.

Waivers; Amendments
(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.18 with respect to any Incremental Facility Amendment, neither any Loan Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders, that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, LC Disbursement or LC Advance or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the date of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.08 or the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the election of the Borrower to switch from GAAP to IFRS this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with only the written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (and not any other Lender or the Required Lenders) to eliminate any changes to the meaning of this Agreement as a result of such election.
