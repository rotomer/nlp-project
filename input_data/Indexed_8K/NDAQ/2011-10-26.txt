Bob Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer and President, NASDAQ OMX said:
"Our fourth consecutive quarter of record earnings was driven by strong growth in revenues. And year-to-date our revenues have increased 13 percent over last year, against a 10 percent decline in U.S. equity volumes. But to truly appreciate our performance one must consider the strength and diversity of the business we've built and evaluate what we've delivered over the longer term, and that is double digit earnings growth. A truly impressive track record for the team here at NASDAQ OMX."

Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, said:
"Building on the positive steps made in prior periods, we continue to take actions to improve our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, we reduced our leverage ratios, refinanced our credit facility, and lowered our borrowing costs. And we recently announced the approval of a $300 million share repurchase plan. The strength of our business model and the strong cash flows it generates leave us well positioned to continue to invest in new growth opportunities and deliver strong returns to investors."

Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $438 million for the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $22 million, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2011 and an increase of $66 million, or 18%, from the third quarter of 2010. Changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar had the impact of decreasing revenues in the third quarter of 2011 by $3 million when compared to the second quarter of 2011, and increasing revenues by $16 million when compared to the third quarter of 2010.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $300 million for the third quarter of 2011, up 8% when compared to the second quarter of 2011 results and 20% when compared to the third quarter of 2010.
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $211 million for the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $22 million, or 12%, when compared to the second quarter of 2011, and $43 million, or 26%, when compared to the third quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $83 million for the third quarter of 2011, equal to revenues for the second quarter of 2011, but up $7 million, or 9%, when compared to the third quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
Issuer Services
Issuer Services revenues were $92 million for the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the second quarter of 2011, and an increase of $7 million, or 8%, when compared to the third quarter of 2010.
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $79 million for the third quarter of 2011, down $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the second quarter of 2011, but up $6 million, or 8%, when compared to the third quarter of 2010. The decrease when compared to the second quarter of 2011 is due to lower Corporate Solutions and European listing revenues. When compared to the prior year period, revenue growth is primarily due to increases in Corporate Solutions revenues, resulting from higher demand for services from listed companies, and increases in listing revenues. When compared to the third quarter of 2010, European listing revenues benefited from changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar.
Global Index Group
Global Index Group revenues were $13 million for the third quarter of 2011, equal to revenues in the second quarter of 2011, and up $1 million, or 8%, when compared to the third quarter of 2010. Higher revenues when compared to the prior year period are primarily due to increases in asset sizes of licensed ETFs, as well as additional demand for new licensed ETFs and other financial products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $46 million for the third quarter of 2011, equal to revenues in the second quarter of 2011, and up $8 million, or 21%, when compared to the third quarter of 2010. The increase when compared to the third quarter of 2010 is primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from SMARTS, which was acquired in August 2010. Also contributing to the increase in revenues when compared to the third quarter of 2010 are revenues associated with recently delivered projects and changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar.
 
 
 
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses increased $5 million, or 2%, to $234 million in the third quarter of 2011 from $229 million in the second quarter of 2011, and increased $31 million, or 15%, from $203 million in the prior year quarter. The increase when compared to the second quarter of 2011 is primarily driven by higher compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. When compared to the third quarter of 2010, the increase is primarily due to higher expenses associated with FTEN (acquired in December 2010), SMARTS (acquired in August 2010), and Zoomvision Mamato (acquired in December 2010). Also contributing to the increase were higher compensation expenses and changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $10 million.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $27 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $28 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $23 million for the third quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest expense when compared to the second quarter of 2011 is primarily due to a lower average interest rate on the floating rate term loan in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in net interest expense when compared to the third quarter of 2010 is primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in December 2010 to partially finance the repurchase of shares. Included in total net interest expense for the third quarter of 2011 is $23 million in interest expense, $4 million of non-cash expense associated with the accretion of debt discounts, $2 million in debt issuance amortization expense, and $1 million of other bank-related fees. Interest income for the third quarter of 2011 was $3 million.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter 2011 earnings per diluted share were $0.67 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 in the second quarter of 2011 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.50 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share was 181 million for the second and third quarters of 2011 and 204 million for the third quarter of 2010.
