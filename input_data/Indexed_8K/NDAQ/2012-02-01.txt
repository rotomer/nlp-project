Expense Guidance
For the full year of 2012 total core operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $915 million to $935 million, plus an additional $40 million to $50 million in incremental new initiative spending, resulting in total operating expenses in the range of $955 million to $985 million.
Financial Review
Revenues
Revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees ("net exchange revenues") were $422 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of $16 million, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2011 but an increase of $22 million, or 6%, from the fourth quarter of 2010. Changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar had the impact of decreasing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011 by $6 million when compared to the third quarter of 2011, and increasing revenues by $1 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Market Services
Market Services net exchange revenues were $281 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, down 6% when compared to the third quarter of 2011 but up 6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
Transaction Services
Net exchange revenues from Transaction Services were $188 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of $23 million, or 11%, when compared to the third quarter of 2011, but an increase of $6 million, or 3%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Data
Market Data revenues were $87 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $4 million, or 5%, when compared to the third quarter of 2011, and up $8 million, or 10%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
Issuer Services
Issuer Services revenues were $93 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the third quarter of 2011, and an increase of $4 million, or 4%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Global Listing Services
Global Listing Services revenues were $80 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $1 million, or 1%, when compared to the third quarter of 2011, and up $3 million, or 4%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenue growth when compared to both periods is primarily due to increases in Corporate Solutions revenues resulting from higher demand for services from customers. Also contributing to the increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 are higher European listing revenues.
Global Index Group
Global Index Group revenues were $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, equal to revenues in the third quarter of 2011, and up $1 million, or 8%, when compared to the
 
 
 
fourth quarter of 2010. Higher revenues when compared to the prior year period are primarily due to increases in asset sizes of licensed ETFs, as well as additional demand for new licensed ETFs and other financial products.
Market Technology
Market Technology revenues were $48 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $2 million, or 4%, when compared to both the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010. Contributing to increases when compared to both periods are revenues associated with recently delivered projects. Somewhat offsetting the increase when compared to the third quarter of 2011 are changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar.
Operating Expenses
Total non-GAAP operating expenses increased $1 million to $235 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $234 million in the third quarter of 2011, and increased $19 million, or 9%, from $216 million in the prior year quarter. The increase when compared to the third quarter of 2011 is primarily driven by higher marketing and advertising expenses, and incremental spending for professional and contract services. Somewhat offsetting these increases are lower compensation expenses and a favorable effect from changes in the exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, the increase is primarily due to higher expenses associated with FTEN (acquired in December 2010), and Zoomvision Mamato (acquired in December 2010). Also contributing to the increase were higher compensation expenses and incremental spending for professional and contract services.
Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Results
Included in the fourth quarter of 2011 results are $44 million of pre-tax expenses associated with debt refinancing, the impairment of an available-for-sale investment security, and merger and strategic initiatives. These expenses have been excluded from non-GAAP results.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $23 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $27 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $24 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest expense when compared to both periods is primarily due to the refinancing of a prior credit facility and the purchase of 2.5% convertible notes. Interest income for the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2011 was $3 million and was $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Earnings Per Share
On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2011 earnings per diluted share were $0.63 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.67 in the third quarter of 2011 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.55 in the prior year quarter. NASDAQ OMX's weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share were 180 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, 181 million for the third quarter of 2011, and 200 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
