Noble Drilling Corporation 7.50% Senior Notes due 2019
     In connection with an internal reorganization (the "Reorganization") involving various subsidiaries of Noble Corporation, a Swiss corporation ("Noble Switzerland"), and Noble Cayman, a Cayman Islands company ("Noble Cayman," and together with Noble Switzerland, the "Registrants"), on September 25, 2009, Noble Drilling Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Noble Drilling"), Noble Drilling Holding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Noble Drilling Services 1 LLC ("NDS1"), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of the Registrants, Noble Holding (U.S.) Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Holding"), Noble Cayman, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor by merger to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (formerly Chase Bank of Texas, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture to the Indenture dated as of May 1, 1999 (as supplemented, the "Noble Drilling Indenture"). The Noble Drilling Indenture governs Noble Drilling's 7.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Noble Drilling Notes"), of which approximately $202 million in aggregate principal amount were outstanding as of September 30, 2009. Pursuant to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, NDS1, as the transferee of certain assets of Noble Drilling, became a co-issuer under the Noble Drilling Indenture and assumed Noble Drilling's covenants and obligations under the Noble Drilling Indenture, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest on and additional amounts due under the Noble Drilling Notes.
     On October 1, 2009, NDS1 merged with and into Noble Drilling Services 6 LLC ("NDS6"), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of the Registrants, with NDS6 being the surviving entity. In connection with the merger, on October 1, 2009, Noble Drilling, NDS6, Holding, Noble Cayman and the Trustee entered into a Fifth Supplemental Indenture to the Noble Drilling Indenture. Pursuant to the Fifth Supplemental Indenture and effective upon the consummation of the merger, NDS6, as successor by merger to NDS1, became a co-issuer under the Noble Drilling Indenture and assumed NDS1's covenants and obligations under the Noble Drilling Indenture, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest on and additional amounts due under the Noble Drilling Notes. NDS1 was released of all of its covenants and obligations under the Noble Drilling Indenture and the Noble Drilling Notes.

Pursuant to the Second Supplemental Indenture, NHIL agreed to fully and unconditionally guarantee the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest on and all other amounts due under the Noble Cayman Indenture and the Noble Cayman Notes.
     The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Supplemental Indenture, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report and is incorporated by reference herein.

          (a) Subject to Subsection 1(b) below, NHIL (or any successor person pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Second Supplemental Indenture) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees (such guarantee being the "Guarantee") to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture and the Notes, that: (i) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes promptly will be paid in full when due, whether at the Maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes, if lawful, and all other payment obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee under the Indenture and the Notes will be promptly paid in full, all in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes, and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other payment obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.

NHIL hereby waives presentment, demand of payment, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture.
          (b) It is the intention of NHIL and the Company that the obligations of NHIL hereunder shall be, but not in excess of, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. Accordingly, if the obligations in respect of the Guarantee would be annulled, avoided or subordinated to the creditors of NHIL by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding actually pending before such court as a result of a determination both that such Guarantee was made without fair consideration and, immediately after giving effect thereto, NHIL was insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or left with an unreasonably small capital, then the obligations of NHIL under the Guarantee shall be reduced by such court if such reduction would result in the avoidance of such annulment, avoidance or subordination; provided, however, that
 
any reduction pursuant to this paragraph shall be made in the smallest amount as is strictly necessary to reach such result. For purposes of this paragraph, "fair consideration," "insolvency," "unable to pay its debts as they mature," "unreasonably small capital" and the effective times of reductions, if any, required by this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) NHIL shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by NHIL pursuant to the provisions of the Guarantee or the Indenture; provided, however, that NHIL shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all Notes issued under the Indenture shall have been paid in full.
     SECTION 2. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF GUARANTEE

          (ii) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event or condition which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and

supplemental indenture comply with this Section 3 and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with;
          (b) NHIL liquidates (other than pursuant to any applicable bankruptcy law or rule) and complies, if applicable, with the provisions of the Indenture; provided that if a Person and its Affiliates, if any, shall acquire all or substantially all of the assets of NHIL upon such liquidation NHIL shall liquidate only if:
               (i) the Person and each such Affiliate (or the common corporate parent of such Person and its Affiliates, if such Person and its Affiliates are wholly-owned by such parent) which acquire or will acquire all or a portion of the assets of NHIL shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental to the Indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of NHIL, under the Guarantee;
               (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event or condition which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and
