be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to service of process in suits, other than for actions or proceedings arising out of the offering of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject; and
     (i) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Pricing Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds".

conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this agreement shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through Barclays Capital Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC expressly for use therein.

9. (a) The Company and the Parent Guarantor, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Parent Guarantor shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Parent Guarantor by any Underwriter through Barclays Capital Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Parent Guarantor against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or the Parent Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Parent Guarantor by such Underwriter through Barclays Capital Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Parent Guarantor for any legal or other expenses
 
reasonably incurred by the Company or the Parent Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Parent Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the
 
Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Parent Guarantor, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Parent Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company and the Parent Guarantor under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company or the Parent Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and the Parent Guarantor and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Parent Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for
 
a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Parent Guarantor agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Parent Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Parent Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Parent Guarantor or any officer or director or controlling person of the Parent Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor the Parent Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities and the Guarantee are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company and the Parent Guarantor as provided herein,
 
the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but neither the Company nor the Parent Guarantor shall then be under further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by Barclays Capital Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC on behalf of you as the representatives.

Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     15. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, the Parent Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Parent Guarantor and each person who controls the Company or the Parent Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

     18. The Company and the Parent Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities and the Guarantee pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-
 
length commercial transaction between the Company and the Parent Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Parent Guarantor, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Parent Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Parent Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or the Parent Guarantor except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other effective agreement between you and the Company or the Parent Guarantor and (iv) the Company and the Parent Guarantor have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.

The obligation of the Company and the Parent Guarantor in respect of any sum due to any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day, following receipt by such Underwriter of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, on which (and only to the extent that) such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency; if the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter hereunder, the Company and the Parent Guarantor agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter against such loss. If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter hereunder, such Underwriter agrees to pay to the Company or the Parent Guarantor, as the case may be, an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter hereunder.
     20. The Company and the Parent Guarantor each hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and the Parent Guarantor each irrevocably appoints Noble Drilling Services Inc. as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any such suit or proceeding, and agrees that service of process upon such agent, and written notice of said service to the Company or the Parent Guarantor, as applicable, by the person serving the same to Noble Drilling Services Inc. at 13135 South Dairy Ashford, Suite 800, Sugar Land, TX 77478, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Company or the Parent Guarantor, as applicable, in any such suit or proceeding.

     22. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
     23. The Company, the Parent Guarantor and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

     25. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the Parent Guarantor are authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company or the Parent Guarantor relating to that treatment and structure without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.

ANNEX I
     1. When the Securities have been authenticated in the manner set forth in the Indenture and delivered against due payment therefor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Securities and the Guarantee will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the Parent Guarantor, respectively, enforceable against the Company and the Parent Guarantor in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. The Securities and the Guarantee, in the forms certified by the Company and the Parent Guarantor, as applicable, as of the date of such opinion letter, and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Agreement and in the information set forth under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes" in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     2. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, the Parent Guarantor and the Trustee, the Indenture constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
     3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Parent Guarantor of this Agreement and the Indenture and the consummation by the Company and the Parent Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not violate or result in any breach of (i) any agreement or instrument filed as an exhibit to or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or (ii) any Applicable Laws, except, in the case of clause (i), for such violations or breaches that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. "Applicable Laws" is defined as the laws of the State of New York, the laws of the State of Texas and the laws of the United States of America that, in such counsel's experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement and the Indenture.
     4. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any Applicable Governmental Authority is required for the issue and sale by the Company of the Securities, the making of the Guarantee by the Parent Guarantor or the consummation by the Company or the Parent Guarantor of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act, and
 
such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under the state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters. "Applicable Governmental Authority" is defined as any governmental body, agency or court of the United States of America, the State of Texas or the State of New York.
     5. Neither the Company nor the Parent Guarantor is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus neither will be, an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.
     Such counsel will also provide the following:
     Such counsel has reviewed the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the Parent Guarantor, with representatives of the Parent Guarantor's independent registered public accounting firm and with you and your counsel, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. The purpose of such counsel's professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, and such counsel has not undertaken to verify independently any of the factual matters in such documents. Moreover, many of the determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus involve matters of a non-legal nature. Accordingly, such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (except to the extent stated in the last sentence of paragraph 4 above). Subject to the foregoing and on the basis of the information such counsel gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, such counsel advises you that:
     (a) the Registration Statement, as of the latest effective time, the Pricing Prospectus, as of the Applicable Time, and the Prospectus, as of its date and the Time of Delivery, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
     (b) nothing came to such counsel's attention that caused it to believe that:
     (i) the Registration Statement, as of the latest effective time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
 
     (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
it being understood that in each case such counsel has not been asked to, and does not, express any belief with respect to (a) the financial statements and schedules or other financial or accounting information contained or included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, (b) representations and warranties and other statements of fact contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement or documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or (c) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1.

     In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined (a) the Registration Statement, (b) the Prospectus, (c) the Indenture dated as of November 21, 2008 between NHIL and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, (the ""), and (d) a form of Second Supplemental Indenture among NHIL, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as described in the Prospectus (the "," and together with the Base Indenture, the ""), pursuant to which the Notes will be issued.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes, when they have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and duly purchased and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of NHIL and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and the Guarantee will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in each case against NHIL and the Guarantor, as the case may be, in accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof is subject to the effect of (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity and public policy (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K. We also consent to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus.
