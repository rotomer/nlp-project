Fleet Status Update
The Company hereby incorporates by reference into this Item 7.01 the Noble Corporation and Subsidiaries Fleet Status Update as of September 29, 2010, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and will be published on the Companys website at http://www.noblecorp.com.

Merger-Related Costs and Effective Tax Rate
Nobles financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 will include costs incurred during the quarter related to the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited (Frontier), which closed on July 28, 2010.  Noble expects these merger-related costs, which are not tax-effected, to be $14 to $17 million.
In addition, for the third quarter of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.  Our tax rate can vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and the tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 will be impacted primarily by the current moratorium on specified types of drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and by our decision to reserve the revenue on the contract pending resolution of a dispute with our customer.   The determination of our final merger-related costs and our tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 is subject to the finalization and review of our financial results for the quarter.
