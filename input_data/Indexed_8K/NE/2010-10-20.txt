PRESS RELEASE
ZUG, Switzerland, October 20, 2010  Noble Corporation (NYSE: NE) today reported third quarter 2010 earnings of $86 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, versus $426 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, for the third quarter of last year. Results for the third quarter 2010 reflect $14 million, or $0.05 cents per share, in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited ("Frontier") at the end of July 2010. Contract drilling services revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were $585 million versus $875 million in the third quarter of 2009. The Company generated $271 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter.
"We are pleased to have closed the Frontier transaction during the quarter and commenced a new chapter in our relationship with Shell," said David W. Williams, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, the continuing and far-reaching effects of the ongoing operational disruption in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico negatively impacted Noble's third-quarter results. We recognize that the effects of U.S. policies related to offshore drilling will be felt into 2011 and beyond. Noble continues to make progress toward full compliance with the recently released regulatory changes and we look forward to clearing the remainder of these hurdles and returning to work in the near term."
Noble invested $355 million in capital projects during the quarter and repurchased 4 million shares at an average cost per share of $32.67, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in 2010 to 6.1 million shares as of September 30, 2010. At the end of the third quarter 2010, the Company had approximately 6.8 million shares remaining on its existing repurchase authorization. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased to 27.4 percent at September 30, 2010 from approximately 9.4 percent at the end of the second quarter 2010 due to the issuance of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in July 2010 to finance the purchase of Frontier and the assumption of approximately $690 million of fully consolidated joint venture project financing debt.

"Looking ahead, while there is little doubt we will be forced to endure continued challenges in the U.S. Gulf as a result of regulatory uncertainty, we remain optimistic about the long-term strength of the Company and the industry," said Williams.
