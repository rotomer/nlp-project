In December, Noble announced the construction of two JU3000N high-specification jackups with total costs of $220 million per rig. The Company has options to construct up to four additional units exercisable before year-end 2011. In January, Noble also announced plans to construct two ultra-deepwater drillships at a cost of $605 million per unit. This contract contains options for up to two additional units which must be exercised by early May 2011. One of the drillships has received a Letter of Intent to work for Shell upon delivery in 2013 at a base dayrate of $410,000. The unit will be eligible for a 15 percent performance bonus.
"These newbuild announcements reinforce our strategy of adding high-specification rigs to our fleet at investment levels we believe will generate solid returns," said Williams. "Since 2005, we have more than doubled Noble's floating fleet, and upon completion of our existing newbuild program, we expect to have twelve ultra-deepwater units deployed in major petroleum basins around the world. Likewise, the JU3000N units will continue the modernization of our jackup fleet and be some of the most capable rigs in the world. These newbuilds, each to be constructed under turnkey contracts with proven shipyards, are expected to deliver value for many years to come."
