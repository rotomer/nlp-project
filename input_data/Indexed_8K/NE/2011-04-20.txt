"Noble's first quarter results reflect the continuing impact of drilling restrictions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico," said David W. Williams, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, improving utilization in the rest of the world coupled with our extensive contract backlog afforded us the financial flexibility to expand and extend our newbuild program, adding both high-spec ultra-deepwater and jackup units to the fleet. With several new contracts commencing this quarter and the possibility of increased permitting in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we expect contract drilling revenues to improve across the balance of the year."
In February 2011, Noble issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in three separate tranches with a weighted average coupon of 4.71 percent. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay our half of the $693 million of joint venture debt associated with the and drillships. Our joint venture partner, Shell, contributed the remaining half to retire the full balance of the debt. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 29 percent at March 31, 2011.

"A number of anticipated catalysts have come to fruition and created value for our shareholders during the quarter, including a return to work of rigs in the U.S. Gulf, in Mexico, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean," said Williams. "With what is now eleven newbuilds, we have committed to a significant fleet upgrade program and are beginning to evaluate our existing assets to determine their ultimate future within our fleet.
