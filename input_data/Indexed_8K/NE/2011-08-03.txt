This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Noble Corporation (the Company) on May 4, 2011 (the Original Filing) to update Item 5.07, Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders, in the Original Filing regarding the results of the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 29, 2011 (the 2011 Annual Meeting).
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At the 2011 Annual Meeting, the Companys shareholders voted, on a non-binding advisory basis, that the Company annually conduct a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers, as such compensation is disclosed in the proxy statement for the annual shareholder meeting. On July 29, 2011, after considering the results of the shareholder advisory vote and other factors, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold an annual advisory vote on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers until the next required vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers or the Board of Directors otherwise determines that a different frequency for such advisory votes is in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company.
The information reported under Item 5.07 of the Original Filing is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
