PRESS RELEASE
ZUG, Switzerland, October 19, 2011  Noble Corporation (NYSE: NE) today reported third quarter 2011 earnings of $135 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $54 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2011. Contract drilling services revenues totaled $705 million in the third quarter of 2011, up 20 percent from $590 million in the second quarter of 2011. Contract drilling margin percentage for the third quarter of 2011 improved to approximately 49 percent compared to 43 percent in the prior quarter, reflecting higher fleet utilization and average daily revenues. Third quarter results included a benefit of approximately $0.04 per diluted share relating to certain discrete tax items. Noble invested $559 million in capital projects during the third quarter, resulting in capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 of approximately $2 billion.
At September 30, 2011, approximately 81 percent of the Company's available rig operating days in the floating rig fleet were committed to contracts for the remainder of 2011, with approximately 87 percent of the days committed for the jackup rig fleet. For 2012, approximately 62 percent and 52 percent of rig operating days were committed for the floating and jackup rig fleets, respectively.
David W. Williams, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, noted, "The third quarter was highlighted by a number of accomplishments that further advance the strategic transformation of our fleet. Options for two additional JU3000N design high specification jackup rigs were exercised, bringing the total number of these units to six currently under construction. Additionally, we ordered a fourth ultra-deepwater drillship from Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., increasing the total number of new, dynamically positioned drillships being added to our fleet to eight. Furthermore, this quarter our ongoing projects have achieved several milestones including the delivery of the drillship , which is now in transit to the Gulf of Mexico. The drillship, , has departed the dock to begin sea trials and the is undergoing the installation of topsides and commissioning."

"During the quarter, there were a number of contract awards and extensions throughout our fleet of floating and jackup units. These awards contributed to a revenue backlog at September 30, 2011 of $12.8 billion, which was essentially flat with the measure at June 30, 2011," Williams said.
Operations Highlights
In Mexico, where fleet utilization improved to 86 percent in the third quarter from 65 percent in the second quarter of 2011, two of the Company's jackup rigs received contract extensions; , to late December 2011, at a dayrate of $58,000, level with the previous contract, and the to late August 2014 at a dayrate of $68,000, up from $58,000 on the previous contract.

In closing, Williams commented, "We are witnessing an intensified effort by a number of customers to secure jackup and floating rigs for drilling operations in 2012 and beyond, supporting higher fleet utilization and improving dayrates, in spite of the unstable global macroeconomic picture. This effort, pertaining to jackup rig needs, remains most evident in Mexico, the North Sea, the Middle East and increasingly in Asia. In the floating rig fleet, especially ultra-deepwater rigs, the increased demand is apparent in numerous regions, but is most pronounced in Brazil, Africa, and the Gulf of Mexico, with all three regions displaying exceptional hydrocarbon potential."
 
"Our fleet is well positioned to benefit from this continued increase in activity, with available jackup rig capacity in Mexico and the North Sea, along with available deepwater capacity expected in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, where the semisubmersible rigs and , respectively, are expected to complete contracts in early 2012."
