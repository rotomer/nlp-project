ITEM 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) As previously announced, on January 9, 2012, James A. MacLennan commenced his employment as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Controller of Noble Corporation, a Swiss company (the "Company").
In October 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a new form of change of control employment agreement for executive officers employed after such time. Mr. MacLennan and Noble Drilling Services Inc. have entered into a change of control employment agreement substantially in the new form, effective as of January 9, 2012, that is guaranteed by the Company. The agreement becomes effective only upon a change of control (within the meaning set forth in the agreement) and remains effective for three years thereafter. Under the new form of employment agreement, if a defined change of control occurs and the employment of the officer is terminated either by the Company (for reasons other than death, disability or cause) or by the officer for good reason, which requirements can be referred to as a "double trigger," the officer will receive or be entitled to the following benefits:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A "change of control" is defined in the new form of employment agreement to mean:
 
 
 
 
However, a "change of control" will not occur as a result of a transaction if (i) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii) either (A) the shareholdings for such holding company immediately following such transaction are the same as the shareholdings immediately prior to such transaction or (B) the shares of the Company's voting securities outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such holding company immediately after giving effect to such transaction.
Under the agreement, "cause" means (i) the willful and continued failure by the officer to substantially perform his duties or (ii) the willful engaging by the officer in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially detrimental to the Company or its affiliates.
Payments to "specified employees" under Section 409A of the Code may be delayed until six months after the termination of the officer's employment.
The agreement provides that if the officer's employment is terminated within three years after a change of control by reason of disability or death, the agreement will terminate without further obligation to the officer or the officer's estate or beneficiary, other than for the payment of Accrued Obligations, the Severance Amount, the Supplemental Retirement Amount and the timely provision of the Welfare Benefit Continuation. If the officer's employment is terminated for cause within the three years after a change of control, the agreement will terminate
without further obligation to the officer other than for payment of the officer's base salary through the date of termination, to the extent unpaid, and the timely payment when otherwise due of any compensation previously deferred by the officer. If the officer voluntarily terminates the officer's employment within the three years after a change of control, excluding a termination for good reason, the agreement will terminate without further obligation to the officer other than for payment of the officer's base salary through the date of termination, to the extent unpaid, the payment of the Accrued Obligations, and the timely payment when otherwise due of any compensation previously deferred by the officer.
The agreement provides that payments thereunder do not reduce any amounts otherwise payable to the officer, or in any way diminish the officer's rights as an employee, under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement or other contract or agreement of the Company or any of its affiliated companies providing benefits to the officer.
The agreement also contains a confidentiality provision obligating the officer to hold in strict confidence and not to disclose or reveal, directly or indirectly, to any person, or use for the officer's own personal benefit or for the benefit of anyone else, any trade secrets, confidential dealings or other confidential or proprietary information belonging to or concerning the Company or any of its affiliated companies, with certain exceptions set forth expressly in the provision.
Any term or condition of the agreement may be waived at any time by the party entitled to have the benefit thereof (whether the subsidiary of the Company party to the agreement or the officer) if evidenced by a writing signed by such party.
The foregoing description of the new form of change of control employment agreement and guaranty is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Employment Agreement and Guaranty, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
In October 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved new form agreements for awards of time-vested restricted stock units and nonqualified stock options under the 1991 Plan, which has previously been approved by the shareholders of the Company. In connection with Mr. MacLennan's appointment as an officer of the Company, the Compensation Committee authorized and approved the issuance on January 9, 2012 of awards of 49,052 time-vested restricted stock units and 44,803 stock options under the new form agreements. These awards vest one-third per year over three years commencing on the first anniversary of the award. The new forms of time-vested restricted stock unit award agreement and nonqualified stock option award agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

Reg. section 1.414(c)-2 for the purposes of determining trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are under common control for the purposes of Section 414(c) of the Code, the phrase "at least 50 percent" shall be used instead of the phrase "at least 80 percent" in each place the phrase "at least 80 percent" appears in Treas.

(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably detrimental to the Company and/or its affiliated companies, monetarily or otherwise.
 
For purposes of this provision, no act, or failure to act, on the part of the Executive shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of Noble-Switzerland. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Noble-Switzerland Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or another senior officer of Noble-Switzerland or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company and its affiliated companies. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the entire membership of the Noble-Switzerland Board then in office at a meeting of the Noble-Switzerland Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Noble-Switzerland Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Noble-Switzerland Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(d) . The Executive may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder at any time during the Employment Term for Good Reason (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean any of the following (without the Executive's express written consent):
Termination by Executive
(i) a material diminution in the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), duties, functions, responsibilities or authority as contemplated by Paragraph 3(a) of this Agreement;
(ii) a material failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of Paragraph 4 of this Agreement;
(iii) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Paragraph 3(c) of this Agreement, or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on the Company's or its affiliated companies' business to a substantially greater extent than during the three-year period immediately preceding the Effective Date;
(iv) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Paragraph 17(c) of this Agreement; or
(v) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not have the right to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for Good Reason unless (i) within 60 days of the initial existence of the condition or conditions giving rise to such right the Executive provides written notice to the Company of the existence of such condition or conditions, and (ii) the Company fails to remedy such condition or conditions within 30 days following the receipt of such written notice. If any such condition is not remedied within such 30-day period, the Executive may provide a Notice of Termination for Good Reason in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 5(e).
 
(e) . Any termination of the Executive's employment hereunder by the Company or by the Executive (other than a termination pursuant to Paragraph 5(a)) shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination (as defined below) to the other party hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) in the case of a termination for Disability, Cause or Good Reason, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated, and (iii) specifies the Date of Termination (as defined in Paragraph 5(f) below); provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, a Notice of Termination given in connection with a termination for Good Reason shall be given by the Executive within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 150 days, following the initial existence of one or more of the conditions giving rise to such right of termination. The failure by the Company or the Executive to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Disability, Cause or Good Reason shall not waive any right of the Company or the Executive hereunder or preclude the Company or the Executive from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Company's or the Executive's rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
(f) . For purposes of this Agreement, the "Date of Termination" shall mean the effective date of the termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, which date shall be (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Executive's death, the date of the Executive's death, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated because of the Executive's Disability, the Disability Effective Date, (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company (or applicable affiliated company) for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date on which the Notice of Termination is given, (iv) if the Executive's employment is terminated pursuant to Paragraph 2(a), the date on which the Employment Term ends pursuant to Paragraph 2(a) due to a party's delivery of a Notice of Termination thereunder, and (v) if the Executive's employment is terminated for any other reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination, which date shall in no event be earlier than the date such notice is given.

Cause; Other than for Good Reason
(i) If the Executive's Separation from Service occurs by reason of the Company's termination of Executive's employment hereunder for Cause, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive hereunder other than the obligation to pay the Executive's Base Salary through the Executive's Separation Date and the timely payment or provision of deferred compensation and other employee benefits if and when otherwise due.
 
(ii) If the Executive's Separation from Service occurs by reason of the Executive's voluntary termination of the Executive's employment hereunder, excluding a termination of such employment by the Executive for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive hereunder other than for (1) the payment of the Executive's Base Salary through the Executive's Separation Date to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) the payment of the Accrued Obligations (which, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6(e) of this Agreement, shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days after the Executive's Separation Date), and (3) the timely payment or provision of deferred compensation and other employee benefits if and when otherwise due.

Payment Delay for Specified Employee
7. .
Certain Excise Taxes
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), and the payments and benefits provided for under this Agreement, together with any other payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to receive from the Company or any of its affiliated companies, would constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the payments and benefits provided for under this Agreement shall be either (a) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such total amounts and benefits received by the Executive from the Company and its affiliated companies will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three times the Executive's "base amount"(as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts and benefits received by the Executive shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or (b) paid in full, whichever produces the better net after-tax position to the Executive (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable taxes). The reduction of payments and benefits hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing, first, payments or benefits to be paid in cash hereunder in the order in which such payment or benefit would be paid or provided (beginning with such payment or benefit that would be made last in time and continuing, to the extent necessary, through to such payment or benefit that would be made first in time) and, then, reducing any benefit to be provided in kind hereunder in a similar order. The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the payments and benefits provided hereunder is necessary shall be made by the Company in good faith. If a reduced payment or benefit is made or provided and through error or otherwise that payment or benefit, when aggregated with other payments and benefits from the Company (or its affiliated companies) used in determining if a parachute payment exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than three times the Executive's base amount, then the Executive shall immediately repay such excess to the Company upon
 
notification that an overpayment has been made. Nothing in this Paragraph 7 shall require the Company (or any of its affiliated companies) to be responsible for, or have any liability or obligation with respect to, the Executive's excise tax liabilities under Section 4999 of the Code.

(a) All of the Awarded Restricted Stock Units that have not already vested shall become fully vested and no longer subject to any forfeiture restrictions under this Agreement if Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates (i) by reason of the death or Disability of Employee or (ii) after the occurrence of a Change in Control, by reason of (A) the Company's termination of Employee's employment other than for Cause or (B) Employee's termination of Employee's employment for Good Reason.
(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure of Employee to perform substantially Employee's duties for the Company (other than any such failure resulting from bodily injury or disease or any other incapacity due to mental or physical illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Employee by the Executive Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Company, which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes Employee has not substantially performed Employee's duties; or (ii) the willful engaging by Employee in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably detrimental to the Company and/or its Affiliates, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this provision, no act, or failure to act, on the part of Employee shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Employee in bad faith or without reasonable belief that Employee's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or another senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Company in good faith and in the best interests of the Company and its Affiliates.
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean any of the following (without Employee's express written consent): (i) a material diminution in Employee's base salary as of the day immediately preceding the Change in Control or (ii) the Company's requiring Employee to be based at any office or location more than 50 miles from Employee's principal office or location as of the day immediately preceding the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not have the right to terminate Employee's employment hereunder for Good Reason unless (1) within 60 days of the initial existence of the condition or conditions giving rise to such right Employee provides written notice to the Executive Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Company of the existence of such condition or conditions, and (2) the Company fails to remedy such condition or conditions within 30 days following the receipt of such written notice (the "Cure Period"). If any such condition is not remedied within the Cure Period, Employee must terminate Employee's employment with the Company within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the end of the Cure Period.
4. . As soon as practicable (but no later than 30 days) following the date an Awarded Restricted Stock Unit vests, the Company shall issue or transfer to Employee one Share in settlement of such Awarded Restricted Stock Unit and such Awarded Restricted Stock Unit shall be canceled.
Issuance of Shares
5. . Employee shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, voting rights or the right to receive dividends and distributions as a shareholder, with respect to the Shares subject to the Awarded Restricted Stock Units, unless and until such Shares are issued or transferred to Employee as provided herein.
No Rights as Shareholder
 
6. . The Company hereby awards cash dividend and cash distribution equivalent rights to Employee with respect to the Awarded Restricted Stock Units. The cash dividend and cash distribution equivalent rights awarded to Employee under this Section 6 shall entitle Employee to the payment, with respect to each Share that is subject to an Awarded Restricted Stock Unit that has not been canceled or forfeited, of an amount in cash equal to the amount of any cash dividend or other cash distribution paid by the Company with respect to one Share while such Awarded Restricted Stock Unit remains outstanding. Such amount shall be paid to Employee by Employee's employer on the date of the payment of the related cash dividend or cash distribution.
Cash Dividend and Cash Distribution Equivalent Rights
7. .
Agreements Regarding Withholding Taxes
(a) Employee shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for the payment of taxes of any kind that are required by law to be withheld with respect to the Awarded Restricted Stock Units or the cash dividend and cash distribution equivalent rights awarded under this Agreement, including, without limitation, taxes applicable to (i) the awarding of the Awarded Restricted Stock Units or the issuance or transfer of Shares in settlement thereof, or (ii) the awarding of the cash dividend and cash distribution equivalent rights or the payments made with respect thereto.
(b) Unless and until the Committee shall determine otherwise and provide notice to Employee in accordance with Section 7(c) of this Agreement, any obligation of Employee under Section 7(a) of this Agreement that arises with respect to the issuance or transfer of Shares in settlement of Awarded Restricted Stock Units that have become vested shall be satisfied by the Company withholding a portion of such Shares valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date on which the taxable event that gives rise to the withholding requirement occurs.
(c) The Committee may determine, after the Effective Date and on notice to Employee, to authorize one or more arrangements (in addition to or in lieu of the arrangement described in Section 7(b) of this Agreement) satisfactory to the Committee for Employee to satisfy the obligation of Employee under Section 7(a) of this Agreement.
(d) If Employee does not, for whatever reason, satisfy the obligation of Employee under Section 7(a) of this Agreement, then the Company and its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payments of any kind otherwise due to Employee the amount required to satisfy the obligation of Employee under Section 7(a) of this Agreement.
8. . This Agreement is not assignable or transferable by Employee. No right or interest of Employee under this Agreement or the Plan may be assigned, transferred or alienated, in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law (except pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code or a similar domestic relations order under applicable foreign law, either in such form as is acceptable to the committee), and no such right or interest shall be liable for or subject to any debt, obligation or liability of Employee.
Non-Assignability
9. . Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the capitalized terms used (and not otherwise defined) in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them under the provisions of the Plan. By execution of this Agreement, Employee agrees that the Awarded Restricted Stock Units and the cash dividend and cash distribution equivalent rights awarded under this Agreement shall be governed by and subject to all applicable provisions of the Plan. This Agreement is subject to the Plan, and the Plan shall govern where there is any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement.

The Committee has determined that the following specified restricted time periods shall be applicable to the Awarded Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to the Agreement:
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.3
THIS AGREEMENT, made as of the             day of             , 201    , by and between NOBLE CORPORATION, a Swiss corporation (the "Company"), and First_Name MI Last_Name ("Employee");
WHEREAS, the committee (the "Committee") acting under the Company's 1991 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, as amended (the "Plan"), has determined that it is desirable to grant a nonqualified stock option to Employee under the Plan;
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Plan, the Committee has determined that the option so awarded shall be subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions of this Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. . On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Company hereby grants to Employee the option to purchase Options registered shares of the Company ("Shares") at the price of $            per share, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, for a period commencing one year from the date of this Agreement and terminating on the first to occur of (i) the expiration of ten years from the date of this Agreement and (ii) the date Employee ceases for any reason to be employed by at least one of the employers in the group of employers consisting of the Company and its Affiliates (a "termination of employment"); provided that the number of Shares purchasable hereunder in any period or periods of time during which the option evidenced hereby is exercisable shall be limited as follows:
Grant of Option, Option Period and Terms of Exercise of Option
 
 
 
If a termination of employment occurs after the date upon which the option first becomes exercisable and before the date that is ten years from the date hereof for any reason other than Employee's (i) death, Disability, Retirement or (ii) within three years after the occurrence of a Change in Control, by reason of (A) the Company's termination of Employee's employment other than for Cause (as defined below) or (B) Employee's termination of Employee's employment for Good Reason (as defined below), then the option may be exercised, to the extent that Employee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination of employment, at any time within six months after such termination
 
of employment but not after the expiration of the ten-year period, except that, in the event of a termination of employment of Employee for Cause, the option shall be null and void for all purposes, effective as of such date of termination. Additionally, if a termination of employment occurs after the date upon which the option first becomes exercisable and before the date that is ten years from the date hereof by reason of (1) Employee's death, Disability or Retirement or (2) within three years after the occurrence of a Change in Control, by reason of (y) the Company's termination of Employee's employment other than for Cause or (z) Employee's termination of Employee's employment for Good Reason, then the option, including any then unvested Shares all of which shall be automatically accelerated, may be exercised at any time within five years after such termination of employment but not after the expiration of the ten-year period.
Transfer of employment without interruption of service between or among the Company and any of its Affiliates shall not be considered a termination of employment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Shares may be purchased upon exercise of the option.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure of Employee to perform substantially Employee's duties for the Company (other than any such failure resulting from bodily injury or disease or any other incapacity due to mental or physical illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Employee by the Executive Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Company, which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes Employee has not substantially performed Employee's duties; or (ii) the willful engaging by Employee in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably detrimental to the Company and/or its Affiliates, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this provision, no act, or failure to act, on the part of Employee shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Employee in bad faith or without reasonable belief that Employee's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or another senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Company in good faith and in the best interests of the Company and its Affiliates.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean any of the following (without Employee's express written consent): (i) a material diminution in Employee's base salary as of the day immediately preceding the Change in Control or (ii) the Company's requiring Employee to be based at any office or location more than 50 miles from Employee's principal office or location as of the day immediately preceding the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not have the right to terminate Employee's employment hereunder for Good Reason unless (1) within 60 days of the initial existence of the condition or conditions giving rise to such right Employee provides written notice to the Executive Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Company of the existence of such condition or conditions, and (2) the Company fails to remedy such condition or conditions within 30 days following the receipt of such written notice (the "Cure Period"). If any such condition is not remedied within the Cure Period, Employee must terminate Employee's employment with the Company within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the end of the Cure Period.
 
2. . Employee hereby agrees to serve the Company or Affiliate by performing the duties now assigned to Employee or such other duties as may hereafter be assigned to Employee, at Employee's present salary, with such increases and bonuses, if any, as the Company or Affiliate may authorize, for a period of at least one year from the date hereof. There is no obligation on the part of the Company or Affiliate to continue Employee's employment for said one-year period or for any period, and nothing in this Agreement shall in any way interfere with the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of Employee at any time, with or without Cause.
Agreement of Employee Regarding Employment
3. . Except as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, the option may not be exercised unless Employee is, at the time of exercise, an employee of the Company or an Affiliate.
Requirement of Employment
4. .
Exercise of Option
(a) The option may be exercised by notice to the Company signed by Employee which shall state the number of Shares as to which the option is exercised and shall be accompanied by the full amount of the purchase price of such Shares. The purchase price may be paid in cash or by certified check or cashier's check or, if permitted by the Committee, in whole or in part, by the surrender of issued and outstanding Shares (including an actual or deemed multiple series of exchanges of such Shares) which shall be credited against the purchase price at the Fair Market Value of the Shares surrendered on the date of exercise of the option.
(b) Promptly after demand by the Company, and at its direction, Employee shall pay to the Company or the appropriate Affiliate an amount equal to the applicable withholding taxes due in connection with the grant, vesting and/or exercise of the option. Such withholding taxes may be paid in cash or by certified check or cashier's check or, subject to the further provisions of this Paragraph 4(b), in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold from the Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the option a number of Shares having a value equal to the amount of such withholding taxes or by surrendering to the Company or the appropriate Affiliate a number of issued and outstanding Shares having a value equal to the amount of such withholding taxes. The value of any Shares so withheld by or surrendered to the Company or the appropriate Affiliate shall be based on the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date on which the option is exercised (in the case of a withholding of Shares) or the date (which shall not be earlier than the date of the event requiring withholding) on which the Shares are surrendered (in the case of a surrender of Shares). Employee shall pay to the Company or the appropriate Affiliate in cash or by certified check or cashier's check the amount, if any, by which the amount of such withholding taxes exceeds the value of the Shares so withheld or surrendered. Any election by Employee to have Shares withheld or to surrender Shares to pay withholding taxes must be made in writing at or prior to the time of exercise of the option (in the case of a withholding of Shares) or at or prior to the time of surrender of the Shares (in the case of a surrender of Shares).
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at the request of Employee and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, selectively approve arrangements with a brokerage firm or firms under which any such brokerage firm shall, on behalf of Employee, make payment in full to the Company of the aggregate purchase price of the Shares then being purchased upon exercise of the option, and the Company, pursuant to an irrevocable notice in writing from Employee, shall make prompt delivery of the purchased Shares to or on behalf of Employee. Payment in full for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence shall mean payment of the full amount due, either in cash or by certified check or cashier's check. Any arrangements shall be subject to such rules and regulations as the Committee may adopt in connection therewith.
5. . Delivery of the appropriate number of Shares to or on behalf of Employee shall be made as promptly as practicable after receipt by the Company of notice of exercise and payment in full of the purchase price and, if required, the amount of any withholding taxes; provided, however, that the Company shall have such time as is necessary to qualify or register such Shares under any applicable law or governmental rule or regulation or list such Shares on any securities exchange on which the Shares are listed.
Delivery Upon Exercise of Option
6. .
Transferability
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 6(b) below, the option evidenced hereby is not transferable otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or the rules thereunder, and may be exercised during the life of Employee only by Employee.
(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph 6(a), the option evidenced hereby may be transferred, in whole or in part, by Employee (i) by gift to the Immediate Family Members (as defined in Paragraph 6(c) below) of Employee, partnerships whose only partners are Employee or the Immediate Family Members of Employee, limited liability companies whose only shareholders or members are Employee or the Immediate Family Members of Employee, and trusts established solely for the benefit of Employee or the Immediate Family Members of Employee, or (ii) to any other persons or entities in the discretion of the Committee; provided, that any subsequent transfers of a transferred option shall be prohibited except those in accordance with Paragraph 6(a). Following transfer, any such option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer; provided, that for purposes of this Agreement, the term "Employee" (except as used in the next succeeding sentence) shall be deemed to refer to the transferee. The events of any termination of employment set forth in Paragraph 1 above shall continue to be applied with respect to Employee, following which any transferred options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods, specified in Paragraph 1 above.
 
(c) "Immediate Family Members" as used in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned thereto under the Plan, i.e., the spouse, former spouse, children (including stepchildren) or grandchildren of an individual.
7.. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the capitalized terms used (and not otherwise defined) in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them under the provisions of the Plan.
Defined Terms
8. . By execution of this Agreement, Employee agrees that the option and the Shares to be received upon exercise of the option shall be governed by and subject to all applicable provisions of the Plan. This Agreement is subject to the Plan, and the Plan shall govern where there is any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement.
Plan Provisions
9. . The option evidenced hereby is not an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not constitute a part hereof. This Agreement is governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof, except to the extent Texas law is preempted by Federal law of the United States or by the laws of Switzerland.
