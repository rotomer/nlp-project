PRESS RELEASE
ZUG, Switzerland, July 18, 2012  Noble Corporation (NYSE: NE) today reported second quarter 2012 earnings of $160 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, versus $120 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2012. Earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $54 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. Contract drilling services revenues for the second quarter of 2012 were $848 million versus $746 million for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of approximately 14 percent. For the second quarter of 2011, contract drilling services revenues totaled $590 million. Second quarter 2012 results included a non-recurring after tax net gain of $0.04 per diluted share related to the final settlement of certain Hurricane Ike claims, partially offset by the impairment of two submersible rigs and certain corporate assets.
David W. Williams, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Noble Corporation, stated, "Quarterly results, when compared to the first quarter, include improvements in revenues, margins and cash from operations. These improvements are the result of continuing strength in the offshore drilling business. Furthermore, our fleet mix has begun to shift with the addition of the ultra-deepwater drillships and Revenues from our floating rig fleet accounted for approximately 65 percent of contract drilling services revenues in the quarter, including an estimated 33 percent of revenues from our ultra-deepwater fleet of rigs. These contributions are expected to grow further as we add the remaining five ultra-deepwater drillships to our active fleet. Finally, we have seen some early benefits from a number of operational and process improvements, which have led to fewer unpaid downtime days across the fleet, a figure that declined to under 3 percent in the quarter."

Net cash from operating activities increased to $435 million in the second quarter of 2012, up from $101 million in the first quarter. Average dayrates across the fleet increased 9 percent in the second quarter to $181,700 from $167,100 in the first quarter.
Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was unchanged from the first quarter at approximately 35 percent. Capital expenditures in the first six months of 2012 totaled $665 million, including $162 million (excluding capitalized interest) related to Noble's fleet transformation program. The Company continues to expect capital expenditures for 2012 to total an estimated $1.9 billion, including approximately $618 million for newbuild construction programs.
 
Operations Highlights
At the end of the second quarter of 2012, approximately 79 percent of the Company's available rig operating days were committed for the remainder of 2012, including 79 percent of the floating rig fleet and 84 percent of the jackup fleet. For 2013, an estimated 61 percent of operating days are committed, including 80 percent of the floating rig days and 55 percent of jackup days. Total backlog at June 30, 2012 was approximately $14.4 billion, which excludes the recent contract award for the newbuild drillship .

Williams added, "The first half of 2012 was highlighted by the commencement of operations on our first new ultra-deepwater drillships and the award of a contract for the first of our newbuild jackups, the , a JU3000N high-specification unit. Also, as previously reported, in early July, we were awarded a three-year term contract for the second of our new ultra-deepwater drillships under construction at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., the , representing a total contract value of approximately $677 million. These contracts are evidence of the strong customer demand for drilling rigs with advanced technical specifications and operational efficiencies, and we continue to evaluate high quality opportunities for the remaining uncontracted drillships and jackups in our fleet expansion program."

In the North Sea, jackup fleet utilization remained at 100 percent in the second quarter, while the Company continued to benefit from steady customer demand, supporting an improving dayrate environment.

The semisubmersible rig was awarded a contract to early October 2014 at a dayrate of $275,000, up from a previous dayrate of $247,500. The , along with four of the Company's eight jackups in the region, are now contracted through mid-2013 or beyond.

In the Middle East and India, fleet utilization declined slightly in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter, due in part to downtime on the jackup , which in May incurred leg damage while moving on location and will undergo repairs. The rig is expected to resume its contract in India during the fourth quarter of 2012. The was contracted during the quarter to perform accommodation work until mid-September at $58,000 per day. Additionally, the drillship began in mid-May its three-year contract at $180,000 per day offshore India.

In closing, Williams commented, "Despite economic uncertainty and the corresponding pressure on commodity prices during the second quarter, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Our backlog continues to expand and we are benefitting from growing visibility into the latter part of this decade. The offshore drilling business is characterized by continued successes in exploration drilling and expanding geographies, a building portfolio of field development projects, interest in frontier locations and attractive commodity prices. This is especially true for the deepwater sector of our business, where we continue to see exceptional opportunities offshore the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Africa, Brazil and throughout Asia Pacific. I believe Noble is well positioned to benefit from this active business environment given the availability in our existing fleet of floating and jackup rigs, and through our fleet expansion program."
