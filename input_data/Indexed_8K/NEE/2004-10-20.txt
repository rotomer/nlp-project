On October 15, 2004, FPL Group, Inc.'s (FPL Group) subsidiaries FPL Group Capital Inc (FPL Group Capital) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) refinanced their credit facilities by entering into new five-year revolving credit facilities and amending their respective three-year credit facilities.  Bank lines of credit currently available to FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, under these separate credit facilities aggregate approximately $3.5 billion ($2.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $1.5 billion for FPL).  These credit facilities are available to support the companies' commercial paper programs and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a transmission and distribution property loss (in the case of FPL), as well as for general corporate purposes.  The five-year credit facilities ($1.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $1.0 billion for FPL) expire in October 2009.  The remaining $1.5 billion of credit facilities ($1.0 billion for FPL Grou p Capital and $500 million for FPL) expire in October 2006.  FPL Group (which guarantees payment of FPL Group Capital's credit facilities pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement) is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to capitalization under the terms of FPL Group Capital's credit facilities.  FPL is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to capitalization under the terms of FPL's credit facilities.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
