With respect to the Debentures of the Tenth Series, each of the following events shall be an additional Event of Default under the Indenture:
the consolidation of the Guarantor with or merger of the Guarantor into any other Person, or the conveyance or other transfer or lease by the Guarantor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless

immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and
the failure of the Company to redeem the Outstanding Debentures of the Tenth Series as required by paragraph 11 hereof;
If a Guarantor Event occurs and the Company is not required to redeem the Debentures of the Tenth Series pursuant to paragraph 11 hereof, the Company will provide to the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures of the Tenth Series annual and quarterly reports containing the information that the Company would be required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if it were subject to the reporting requirements of those Sections. If the Company is, at that time, subject to the reporting requirements of those Sections, the filing of annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to those Sections will satisfy this requirement;
The Debentures of the Tenth Series will be initially issued in global form registered in the name of Cede & Co. (as nominee for DTC). The Debentures of the Tenth Series in global form shall bear the depository legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

Exhibit A
[Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to FPL Group Capital Inc or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.]
FPL GROUP CAPITAL INC, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida (herein referred to as the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to
or registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________ Dollars on September 1, 2011 and to pay interest on said principal sum semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each, year commencing March 1, 2007 (each, an "Interest Payment Date") at the rate of 5-5/8% per annum until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest on the Securities of this series will accrue from and including August 18, 2006, to and excluding the first Interest Payment Date, and thereafter will accrue from and including the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. No interest will accrue on the Securities with respect to the day on which the Securities mature. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) with the same force and eff ect as if made on the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be payable to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the "Regular Record Date" for such interest installment which shall be the business day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date so long as the Securities are registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or any other successor depositary or a nominee thereof, provided, however, that if the Securities are not registered in the name of DTC or any other successor depositary or a nominee thereof the Regular Record Date will be the close of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding such Interest Payment Date and provided further that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. Any such interest not so punctua lly paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder of this Security on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York, the State of New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, at the option of the Company, interest on this Security may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto, as such address shall appear on the Security Register or by a wire transfer to an account designated by the Person entitled thereto.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed in New York, New York.
Dated:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities), dated as of June 1, 1999 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officer's Certificate filed with the Trustee on August 18, 2006 creating the series designated on the face hereof (herein called the "Officer's Certificate"), for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
Securities of this series shall be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to the Stated Maturity, upon notice mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), at a price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus (iii) a premium, if any (the "Make-Whole Premium"). In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the Stated Maturity of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over
the principal amount of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed.
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 15 basis points.
The Company will appoint an independent investment banking institution of national standing to calculate the Make-Whole Premium; that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. or Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee at the expense of the Company (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker").
provided
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Independent Investment Banker will determine the Treasury Yield as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
The Independent Investment Banker will determine the weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Independent Investment Banker will calculate the Treasury Yield by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). The Independent Investment Banker will round any weekly average yields so calculated to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Independent Investment Banker will select comparable rates and calculate the Treasury Yield by reference to those rates.
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
The Securities will be absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, by FPL Group, Inc., as Guarantor (the "Guarantor"), pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999, between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York (as Guarantee Trustee) (the "Guarantee Agreement"). The following shall constitute "Guarantor Events" with respect to the Securities:
the failure of the Guarantee Agreement to be in full force and effect;
the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Guarantor in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Guarantor bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition by one or more entities other than the Guarantor seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Guarantor under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Guarantor or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order shall have remained unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
the commencement by the Guarantor of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Guarantor in a case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Guarantor or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, o r the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the authorization of such action by the Board of Directors of the Guarantor.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Securities, the Officer's Certificate dated August 18, 2006, establishing the Securities, or in the Indenture, the Company shall, if a Guarantor Event shall occur and be continuing, redeem all of the Outstanding Securities within 60 days after the occurrence of such Guarantor Event at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of redemption unless, within 30 days after the occurrence of such Guarantor Event, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (a Division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc.) and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (if the Securities are then rated by those rating agencies, or, if the Securities are not then rated by those rating agencies but are then rated by one or more other nationally recognized rating agencies, then at least one of those other nationally recognized rating agencies) shall have reaffirmed in writing that, after giving effect to such Guarantor Event, th e credit rating on the Securities shall be investment grade (i.e. in one of the four highest categories, without regard to subcategories within such rating categories, of such rating agency).
If a Guarantor Event occurs and the Company is not required to redeem the Securities pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Company will provide to the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities annual and quarterly reports containing the information that the Company would be required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if it were subject to the reporting requirements of those Sections. If the Company is, at that time, subject to the reporting requirements of those Sections, the filing of annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to those Sections will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, including the Officer's Certificate described above.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registrat ion of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a dire ction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor and of authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture and/or in the Officer's Certificate shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture and/or in the Officer's Certificate.

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Debentures and the Guarantee, as it relates to the Debentures, are legally issued, valid, and binding obligations of FPL Group Capital and FPL Group, respectively, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity

In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that the certificates representing the Debentures conform to specimens examined by us and that the Debentures have been duly authenticated by the Trustee under the Indenture and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
