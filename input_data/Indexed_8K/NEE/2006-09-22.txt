Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company or the Guarantor may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which such Officer's Certificate or opinion are based are erroneous.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Securities issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company and the Guarantor. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied there in and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 901) conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 1306.
(b)    The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof or may be proved in any other manner which the Trustee and the Company deem sufficient. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
(c)    The principal amount (except as otherwise contemplated in clause (y) of the first proviso to the definition of Outstanding) and serial numbers of Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register;
(d)    Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of a Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantor in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
(e)    Until such time as written instruments shall have been delivered to the Trustee with respect to the requisite percentage of principal amount of Securities for the action contemplated by such instruments, any such instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of a Holder may be revoked with respect to any or all of such Securities by written notice by such Holder or any subsequent Holder, proven in the manner in which such instrument was proven.
(f)    Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after any Act of Holders may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any action taken by such Act of Holders. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to such action may be prepared and executed by the Company and the Guarantor and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series or Tranche.
(g)    If the Company or the Guarantor shall solicit from Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, may, at its option, by Company Order or Guarantor Order, as appropriate, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall have any obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of the Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, n otice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of the record date. Any such Act, given as aforesaid, shall be effective whether or not the Holders which authorized or agreed or consented to such Act remain Holders after such record date and whether or not the Securities held by such Holders remain Outstanding after such record date.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given, and shall be deemed given, to Holders if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event otherwise to be specified therein, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of a series, with the Guarantees endorsed thereon, for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of:
(a)    the instrument or instruments establishing the form or forms and terms of the Securities of such series and the Guarantees to be endorsed thereon, as provided in Sections 201 and 301;
(b)    a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of such Securities with the Guarantees endorsed thereon and to the extent that the terms of such Securities and Guarantees shall not have been established in an indenture supplemental hereto or in a Board Resolution, or in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Board Resolution, all as contemplated by Sections 201 and 301, either (i) establishing such terms or (ii) in the case of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, specifying procedures, acceptable to the Trustee, by which such terms are to be established (which procedures may provide, to the extent acceptable to the Trustee, for authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company or any agent or agents thereof, which oral instructions are to be promptly confirmed electronically or in writing), in either case in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuan t to clause (a) above;
(c)    a Guarantor Order (which may be combined with a Company Order hereunder) approving the terms and delivery of the Guarantees to be endorsed on such Securities as contemplated by the Company Order delivered pursuant to clause (b) above;
(d)    the Securities of such series, each executed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer of the Company and having a Guarantee endorsed thereon executed on behalf of the Guarantor by an Authorized Officer of the Guarantor;
(e)    an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:
(i)    (A) the form or forms of such Securities have been duly authorized by the Company, (B) the form or forms of such Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Guarantor, and (C) the form or forms of the Securities and the Guarantees have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(ii)    (A) the terms of such Securities have been duly authorized by the Company, (B) the terms of such Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Guarantor and (C) the terms of the Securities and the Guarantees have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(iii)    such Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will have been duly issued under this Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, entitled to the benefits provided by this Indenture, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication and delivery of Securities of such series, and the Guarantees endorsed thereon, and that in lieu of the opinions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above such Opinion of Counsel may, alternatively, state, respectively,
(x)    that, when the terms of such Securities and the Guarantees to be endorsed thereon shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or Orders and, if applicable, a Guarantor Order or Orders or pursuant to such procedures (acceptable to the Trustee) as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order or Orders, and, if applicable, a Guarantor Order or Orders all as contemplated by and in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above, such terms will have been duly authorized by the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, and will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(y)    that such Securities, and the Guarantees endorsed thereon, when (1) executed by the Company and the Guarantor, as the case may be, (2) authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture, (3) issued and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel and (4) in the case of Securities, paid for, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the aforesaid Company Order or Orders and, if applicable, a Guarantor Order or Orders or specified procedures referred to in paragraph (x) above, as the case may be, will have been duly issued under this Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights, inclu ding, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company and the Guarantor of any of such Securities and Guarantees, the forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series, with the Guarantees endorsed thereon, unless and until such opinion or other documents have been superseded or revoked or expire by their terms. In connection with the authentication and delivery of Securities of a series, with the Guarantees endorsed thereon, pursuant to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that the Company's instructions to authenticate and deliver such Securities and the Guarantor's approval of the delivery of the Guarantees thereon do not viola te any applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Company or the Guarantor.
If the forms or terms of the Securities of any series have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate as permitted by Sections 201 or 301, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will materially or adversely affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, or any Tranche thereof, each Security and any Guarantee endorsed thereon shall each be dated the date of its authentication.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, or any Tranche thereof, no Security or Guarantee endorsed thereon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer hereof, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security or Guarantee endorsed thereon has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder to the Company, or any Person acting on its behalf, but shall never have been issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Security Regist rar for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security (including any Guarantee endorsed thereon) shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits hereof.
SECTION 304.    Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order and a Guarantor Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, having Guarantees endorsed thereon with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities or Guarantees may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities or Guarantees; provided, however, that temporary Securities need not recite specific redemption, sinking fund, conversion or exchange provisions.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, after the preparation of definitive Securities of such series or Tranche, the temporary Securities of such series or Tranche shall be exchangeable, without charge to the Holder thereof, for definitive Securities of such series or Tranche with the definitive Guarantee endorsed thereon upon surrender of such temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such Securities. Upon such surrender of temporary Securities, the Company shall, except as aforesaid, execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount with the definitive Guarantee endorsed thereon.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and Tranche and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.
SECTION 305.    Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept in each office designated pursuant to Section 602, with respect to the Securities of each series or any Tranche thereof, a register (all registers kept in accordance with this Section being collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities of such series or Tranche and the registration of transfer thereof. The Company shall designate one Person to maintain the Security Register for the Securities of each series on a consolidated basis, and such Person is referred to herein, with respect to such series, as the "Security Registrar." Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of its offices or an office of any Affiliate (including the Guarantor) as an office in which a register with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche or Tranches thereof, shall be ma intained, and the Company may designate itself or any Affiliate (including the Guarantor) as the Security Registrar with respect to one or more of such series. The Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor at all reasonable times.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of such series or Tranche at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such series or Tranche, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, with the Guarantee endorsed thereon.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, any Security of such series or Tranche may be exchanged at the option of the Holder, for one or more new Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities, with the Guarantee endorsed thereon which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities and Guarantees delivered upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon shall be valid obligations of the Company and Guarantor, respectively evidencing the same obligation, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities and Guarantees surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 406 or 1206 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers of the Securities of such series or Tranche called for redemption or (b) any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
SECTION 306.    Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount, having a Guarantee endorsed thereon and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee that such Security is held by a Person purporting to be the owner of such Security, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount, having a Guarantee endorsed thereon and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company or the Guarantor in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) in connection therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security and any Guarantee endorsed thereon shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone other than the Holder of such new Security, and any such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 307.    Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Subject to Section 312, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the related Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company or the Guarantor, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
(a)    The Company or the Guarantor may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a date (herein called a "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company or the Guarantor shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such D efaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Guarantor of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall promptly cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date.
(b)    The Company or the Guarantor may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company or the Guarantor to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
SECTION 308.    Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to the due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Guarantor or Trustee or any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
SECTION 309.    Cancellation by Security Registrar.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Security Registrar, be delivered to the Security Registrar and, if not theretofore canceled, shall be promptly canceled by the Security Registrar. The Company or the Guarantor may at any time deliver to the Security Registrar for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company or the Guarantor may have acquired in any manner whatsoever or which the Company shall not have issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Security Registrar. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities held by the Security Registrar shall be disposed of in accordance with the customary procedures o f the Security Registrar as at the time of disposition shall be in effect, and the Security Registrar shall promptly deliver a certificate of disposition to the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor unless, by a Company Order delivered to the Security Registrar and the Trustee, the Company shall direct that canceled Securities be returned to it. The Security Registrar shall promptly deliver evidence of any cancellation of a Security in accordance with this Section 309 to the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor.
SECTION 310    Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and for any period shorter than a full calendar month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period.
SECTION 311.    Payment to Be in Proper Currency.
In the case of the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, denominated in any currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency (the "Required Currency"), except as otherwise specified with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 301, the obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to make any payment of the principal thereof, or the premium, if any, or interest, if any, thereon, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender by the Company or the Guarantor, or recovery by the Trustee, in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the Trustee timely holding the full amount of the Required Currency then due and payable. If any such tender or recovery is in a currency other than the Required Currency, the Trustee may take such actions as it considers appropriate to exchange such currency for the Required Currency. The costs and risks of any such exchange, including without limitation t he risks of delay and exchange rate fluctuation, shall be borne by the Company and the Guarantor, the Company and the Guarantor shall remain fully liable for any shortfall or delinquency in the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable, and in no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable therefor except in the case of its negligence or willful misconduct.
SECTOPM 312.    Extension of Interest Payment.
The Company shall have the right at any time, so long as no Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, to extend interest payment periods (i.e. defer interest payments) from time to time on all Securities of such series, if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities and upon such terms as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities.
SECTION 313.    CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar may use "CUSIP" or such other numbers in notices or redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, in which case none of the Company or, as the case may be, the Trustee or the Security Registrar, or any agent of any of them, shall have any liability in respect of any CUSIP or such other numbers used on any such notice, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
SECTION 401.    Applicability of Article.
Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series or Tranche) in accordance with this Article.
SECTION 402.    Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate of the Company. The Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee, in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (a) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or (b) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company and the Guarantor, if applicable, shall each furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
SECTION 403.    Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of such series or Tranche not previously called for redemption, by such method as shall be provided for any particular series or Tranche, or, in the absence of any such provision, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may, in any case, provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or Tranche or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series or Tranche of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or Tranche; provided, however, that if, as indicated in an Officer's Certificate, the Company shall have offered to purchase all or any principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of any seri es, or any Tranche thereof, and less than all of such Securities as to which such offer was made shall have been tendered to the Company for such purchase, the Trustee, if so directed by Company Order, shall select for redemption all or any principal amount of such Securities which have not been so tendered.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company, the Guarantor and the Security Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected to be redeemed in part, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 404.    Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106 to the Holders of the Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, all notices of redemption shall state:
(a)    the Redemption Date,
(b)    the Redemption Price, or the formula pursuant to which the Redemption Price is to be determined if the Redemption Price cannot be determined at the time the notice is given,
(c)    if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series or Tranche are to be redeemed, the identification of the particular Securities to be redeemed and the portion of the principal amount of any Security to be redeemed in part,
(d)    that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
(e)    the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, unless it shall have been specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities that such surrender shall not be required,
(f)    that the redemption is for a sinking or other fund, if such is the case,
(g)    the CUSIP numbers, if any, assigned to such Securities; provided however, that such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of CUSIP numbers, and the redemption of such Securities shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers, and
(h)    such other matters as the Company shall deem desirable or appropriate.
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities in accordance with Section 301, with respect to any notice of redemption of Securities at the election of the Company, unless, upon the giving of such notice, such Securities shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance with Section 701, such notice may state that such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Paying Agent or Agents for such Securities, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities and that if such money shall not have been so received such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such Securities. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption shall not be made and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of rede mption was given, that such money was not so received and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Paying Agent or Agents for the Securities otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. Notice of mandatory redemption of Securities shall be given by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
SECTION 405.    Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the conditions, if any, set forth in such notice having been satisfied, the Securities or portions thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Securities or portions thereof, if interest-bearing, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Security or portion thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security; and provided, further, that except as otherwise specif ied as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security, any installment of interest on any Security the Stated Maturity of which installment is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holder of such Security, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the related Regular Record Date according to the terms of such Security and subject to the provisions of Section 307.
SECTION 406.    Securities Redeemed in Part.
Upon the surrender of any Security which is to be redeemed only in part at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and Tranche, of any authorized denomination requested by such Holder and of like tenor and in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered, with the Guarantee endorsed thereon.
SECTION 501.    Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series or Tranche.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 502. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of the series or Tranche in respect of which it was made as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
SECTION 502.    Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
The Company (a) may deliver to the Trustee Outstanding Securities (other than any previously called for redemption) of a series or Tranche in respect of which a mandatory sinking fund payment is to be made and (b) may apply as a credit Securities of such series or Tranche which have been (i) redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities or (ii) repurchased by the Company in the open market, by tender offer or otherwise, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of such mandatory sinking fund payment; provided, however, that no Securities shall be applied in satisfaction of a mandatory sinking fund payment if such Securities shall have been previously so applied. Securities so applied shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operati on of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
SECTION 503.    Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying:
(a)    the amount of the next succeeding mandatory sinking fund payment for such series or Tranche;
(b)    the amount, if any, of the optional sinking fund payment to be made together with such mandatory sinking fund payment;
(c)    the aggregate sinking fund payment;
(d)    the portion, if any, of such aggregate sinking fund payment which is to be satisfied by the payment of cash; and
(e)    the portion, if any, of such aggregate sinking fund payment which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of such series or Tranche pursuant to Section 502 and stating the basis for such credit and that such Securities have not previously been so credited, and the Company shall also deliver to the Trustee not later than 45 days prior to such sinking fund payment date, any Securities to be so delivered.
If the Company shall not deliver such Officer's Certificate, the next succeeding sinking fund payment for such series or Tranche shall be made entirely in cash in the amount of the mandatory sinking fund payment. Not less than 40 days before each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 403 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 404. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 405 and 406.
SECTION 601.    Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
The Company shall pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities of each series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
SECTION 602.    Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Company and the Guarantor shall maintain in each Place of Payment for the Securities of each series, or any Tranche thereof, an office or agency where payment of such Securities shall be made or such Securities shall be surrendered for payment, where the registration of transfer or exchange of such Securities may be effected and where notices and demands to or upon the Company or the Guarantor in respect of such Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company and the Guarantor shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency and prompt notice to the Holders of any such change in the manner specified in Section 106. If at any time the Company or the Guarantor shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, payment of such Securities may be made, registration of transfer or exchange thereof may be effected and notices and demands in respect thereof may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes in any such event.
The Company or the Guarantor may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, for any or all of the foregoing purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of such series or Tranche, no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company or the Guarantor of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such purposes in each Place of Payment for such Securities in accordance with the requirements set forth above. The Company and the Guarantor shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee, and prompt notice to the Holders in the manner specified in Section 106, of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any office or agency required by this Section may be maintained at an office of the Company or the Guarantor or any Affiliate of either of them, in which event the Company, the Guarantor or such Affiliate, as the case may be, shall perform all functions to be performed at such office or agency.
SECTION 603.    Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any of such Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and premium, if any, or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by the Company (or any other obligor on such Securities) to make any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities, deposit with such Paying Agents sums sufficient (without duplication) to pay the principal and premium or interest so becoming due, such sums to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by it so to act.
The Company shall cause each Paying Agent for the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, other than the Company or the Trustee, to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall:
(a)    hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(b)    give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or any other obligor upon such Securities) to make any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities; and
(c)    at any time during the continuance of any such failure, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent and furnish to the Trustee such information as it possesses regarding the names and addresses of the Persons entitled to such sums.
The Company may at any time pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent and, if so stated in a Company Order delivered to the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of Article Seven; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest, if any, has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust; and, upon such payment or discharge, the Holder of such Security shall, as an unsecured general creditor and not as a Holder of an Outstanding Security, look only to the Company and the Guarantor for payment of the amount so due and payable and remaining unpaid, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment to the Company, may at the expense of the Company cause to be mailed, on one occasion only, notice to such Holder that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to the Company.
SECTION 604.    Corporate Existence.
Subject to the rights of the Company and the Guarantor under Article Eleven, each of the Company and the Guarantor shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence.
SECTION 605.    Maintenance of Properties.
Each of the Company and the Guarantor shall cause (or, with respect to property owned in common with others, make reasonable effort to cause) all its properties used or useful in the conduct of its business to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and shall cause (or, with respect to property owned in common with others, make reasonable effort to cause) to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as, in the judgment of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company or the Guarantor from discontinuing, or causing the discontinuance of, the operation and maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, desirable in the conduct of its business.
SECTION 606.    Annual Officer's Certificate as to Compliance.
Not later than April 1 in each year, commencing April 1, 2007, each of the Company and the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate which need not comply with Section 102, executed by its principal executive officer, principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer, as to such officer's knowledge of such obligor's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture, such compliance to be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice under this Indenture.
SECTION 607.    Waiver of Certain Covenants.
The Company or the Guarantor may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in (a) Sections 602, 608 or any additional covenant or restriction specified with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, as contemplated by Section 301 or by clause (b) of Section 1201 if before the time for such compliance the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series and Tranches with respect to which compliance with Section 602, 608 or such additional covenant or restriction is to be omitted, considered as one class, shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition and (b) Section 604, 605 or Article Eleven if before the time for such compliance the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities Outstanding under this Indenture shall, by Act of such Holders, either waiv e such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition; but, in the case of (a) or (b), no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 608.    Restrictions on Dividends and Debt Payments.
If the Company shall have elected to extend any interest payment period as provided in Section 312, and any such period, or any extension thereof, shall be continuing, then neither the Guarantor nor the Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock, (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its capital stock, (iii) pay any principal, interest or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities that are equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities or the Guarantees (as the case may be), or (iv) make any payments with respect to any guarantee of debt securities if such guarantee is equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities or the Guarantees (as the case may be).
The foregoing provisions do not prevent or restrict the Guarantor or the Company from making: (1) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the interest payment period is extended requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock, (2) any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clauses (i) and (ii) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock, (3) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to the conversio n or exchange provisions of its capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts, (4) dividends or distributions paid or made in its capital stock (or rights to acquire its capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts), (5) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, (6) payments under any preferred trust securities guarantee or guarantee of subordinated debentures, which guarantee is executed and delivered by the Guarantor concurrently with the issuance by a trust of any preferred trust securities , so long as the amount of payments made on any preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is paid on all preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full distributions to which each series of preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is then entitled, (7) payments under any guarantee of junior subordinated debentures executed and delivered by the Guarantor (including a Guarantee hereunder), so long as the amount of payments made on any junior subordinated debentures is paid on all junior subordinated debentures then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of junior subordinated debentures is then entitled, (8) dividends or distributions by the Company on its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor, or (9) redemptions, purchases, acquisitions or liquidation payments by the Company with respect to its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor.

(y)  if Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited, an Opinion of Counsel that the obligations so deposited constitute Eligible Obligations and do not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment at the option of the issuer thereof, and an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Company, to the effect that the requirements set forth in clause (b) above have been satisfied; and
(z)  if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Securities, an Officer's Certificate stating the Company's intention that, upon delivery of such Officer's Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Securities or portions thereof will have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section.
Upon the deposit of money or Eligible Obligations, or both, in accordance with this Section, together with the documents required by clauses (x), (y) and (z) above, the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Request, acknowledge in writing that the Security or Securities or portions thereof with respect to which such deposit was made are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture and that the entire indebtedness of the Company and the obligations of the Guarantor in respect thereof have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section. In the event that all of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph shall have been satisfied in respect of any Securities or portions thereof except that, for any reason, the Officer's Certificate specified in clause (z) (if otherwise required) shall not have been delivered, such Securities or portions thereof shall nevertheless be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof shall nevertheless be no longer entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or of any of the covenants of the Company under Article Six (except the covenants contained in Sections 602 and 603) or any other covenants made in respect of such Securities or portions thereof as contemplated by Section 301 or Section 1201(b), but the indebtedness of the Company and the obligations of the Guarantor in respect of such Securities or portions thereof shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged prior to Maturity for any other purpose, and the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof shall continue to be entitled to look to the Company for payment of the indebtedness represented thereby; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing that such Securities or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture.
If payment at Stated Maturity of less than all of the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is to be provided for in the manner and with the effect provided in this Section, the Trustee shall select such Securities, or portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 403 for selection for redemption of less than all the Securities of a series or Tranche.
In the event that Securities which shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, in respect of which the Company's indebtedness and the obligations of the Guarantor in respect thereof shall have been satisfied and discharged, all as provided in this Section do not mature and are not to be redeemed within the 60 day period commencing with the date of the deposit of moneys or Eligible Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a notice, in the same manner as a notice of redemption with respect to such Securities, to the Holders of such Securities to the effect that such deposit has been made and the effect thereof.
Notwithstanding that any Securities shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee in respect of such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 403, 404, 406, 503 (as to notice of redemption), 602, 603, 907, 909, 910 and 915 and this Article Seven shall survive.
The Company shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee or any Paying Agent with which Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited as provided in this Section against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against such Eligible Obligations or the principal or interest received in respect of such Eligible Obligations, including, but not limited to, any such tax payable by any entity deemed, for tax purposes, to have been created as a result of such deposit.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) if, at any time after a Security would be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, the Company's indebtedness and the obligations of the Guarantor in respect thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied or discharged, pursuant to this Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, (i) shall be required to return the money or Eligible Obligations, or combination thereof, deposited with it as aforesaid to the Company or its representative under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or (ii) are unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, such Security shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have bee n paid and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness and the obligations of the Guarantor in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not to have been effected, and such Security shall be deemed to remain Outstanding and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness and the obligations of the Guarantor in respect of any Security shall be subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 603.
SECTION 702.    Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as hereinafter expressly provided), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
(a)    no Securities remain Outstanding hereunder; and
(b)    the Company or the Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company or the Guarantor;
provided, however, that if, in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 701, any Security, previously deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, shall be deemed retroactively not to have been so paid, this Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and discharged, as aforesaid, and to remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall execute and deliver such instruments as the Trustee shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee under Sections 304, 305, 306, 403, 404, 406, 503 (as to notice of redemption), 602, 603, 907, 909, 910 and 915 and this Article Seven shall survive.
Upon satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as provided in this Section, the Trustee shall assign, transfer and turn over to the Company or to the order of the Company, subject to the lien provided by Section 907, any and all money, securities and other property then held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities other than money and Eligible Obligations held by the Trustee pursuant to Section 703 and shall execute and deliver to the Company and the Guarantor such instruments as, in the judgment of the Company and the Guarantor, shall be necessary, desirable or appropriate to effect or evidence the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
SECTION 703.    Application of Trust Money.
Neither the Eligible Obligations nor the money deposited pursuant to Section 701, nor the principal or interest payments on any such Eligible Obligations, shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and such Eligible Obligations and money deposited and the principal and interest payments on any such Eligible Obligations shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities or portions of principal amount thereof in respect of which such deposit was made, all subject, however, to the provisions of Section 603; provided, however, that, so long as there shall not have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, any cash received from such principal or interest payments on such Eligible Obligations, if not then needed for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable, be invested in Eligible Obligations of the type described in clause (b) in the first paragraph of Section 701 maturing at such times and in su ch amounts as shall be sufficient, together with any other moneys and the proceeds of any other Eligible Obligations then held by the Trustee, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Securities or portions thereof on and prior to the Maturity thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestment shall be paid over to the Company or to the order of the Company as received, free and clear of any trust, lien or pledge under this Indenture except the lien provided by Section 907; and provided, further, that, so long as there shall not have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, any moneys held in accordance with this Section on the Maturity of all such Securities in excess of the amount required to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, then due on such Securities shall be paid over to the Company or to the order of the Company free and clear of any trust, lien or pledge under this Indenture except the lien provided by Section 907; and provided, further, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, moneys to be paid over to the Company or to the order of the Company pursuant to this Section shall be held until such Event of Default shall have been waived or cured.
SECTION 801.    Events of Default.
"Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events, subject to such additions and exceptions as may be provided pursuant to Section 301:
(a)    failure to pay interest, on any Security of such series within 30 days after the same becomes due and payable (whether or not payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of Article Fourteen or Article Fifteen hereof); provided, however, that a valid extension of the interest payment period by the Company as contemplated in Section 312 of this Indenture shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest for this purpose; or
(b)    failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, on any Security of such series when it becomes due and payable (whether or not payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of Article Fourteen or Article Fifteen hereof); or

(d)    except as provided by the terms of this Indenture, the Securities of such series and the Guarantees endorsed thereon, the cessation of effectiveness of the Guarantee endorsed on a Security of such series or the finding by any judicial proceeding that the Guarantee endorsed on a Security of such series is unenforceable or invalid or the denial or disaffirmation by the Guarantor of its obligations under the Guarantee endorsed on a Security of such series; or
(e)    the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (1) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or the Guarantor in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (2) a decree or order adjudging the Company or the Guarantor a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition by one or more Persons other than the Company or the Guarantor seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or the Guarantor under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Company or the Guarantor or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order shall have remained unstayed and in effe ct for a period of 90 consecutive days; or

(g)    any other Event of Default specified with respect to Securities of such series.
SECTION 802.    Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default applicable to the Securities of one or more series, but not applicable to all Outstanding Securities, shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each such series may then declare the principal amount of all Securities of such series (or, if any of the Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 301) and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately (provided that the payment of principal and interest on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in this Indenture), by a notice in writing to the Company and the Guarantor (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and, upon receipt by the Company and the Guarantor of notice of such declaration of acceleration, such principal amount (or specified amount) and interest accrued thereon shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default applicable to all Outstanding Securities shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of all Securities then Outstanding (considered as one class), and not the Holders of the Securities of any one of such series, may declare the principal of all Securities (or, if any of the Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 301) and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately (provided that the payment of principal and interest on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in this Indenture), by a notice in writing to the Company and the Guarantor (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and, upon receipt by the Company and the Guarantor of notice of such declaration of acceleration, su ch principal amount (or specified amount) and interest accrued thereon shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series shall have been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due shall have been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Event or Events of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if
(a)    the Company or the Guarantor shall have paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(1)    all overdue interest, if any, on all Securities of such series then Outstanding;
(2)    the principal of and premium, if any, on any Securities of such series then Outstanding which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities;
(3)    to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities;
(4)    all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907;
and
(b)    if, after application of money paid or deposited in accordance with clause (a) of this Section 802, Securities of such series would remain Outstanding, any other Event or Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 813.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 803.    Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
If an Event of Default described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 801 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company or the Guarantor shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of the series with respect to which such Event of Default shall have occurred, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on premium, if any, and on any overdue principal and interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, the rate or rates at which Securities shall bear interest on overdue principal, premium, interest, if any, shall be, to the extent permitted by law, the same rate or rates at which su ch Securities shall bear interest prior to Maturity.
If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company and the Guarantor or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company and the Guarantor or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
SESCTIN 804.    Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or Guarantor or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company or the Guarantor for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(b)    to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amounts due it under Section 907.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 805.    Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities or the Guarantees endorsed thereon may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
SECTION 806.    Application of Money Collected.
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money shall have been collected and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

Second
: To the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable.
Third
SECTION 807.    Limitation on Suits.
No Holder shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(a)    such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series;
(b)    the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, considered as one class, shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
(c)    such Holder or Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
(d)    the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(e)    no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, considered as one class;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
SECTION 808.    Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 307 and 312) interest, if any, on such Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 809.    Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Guarantor and Trustee and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
SECTION 810.    Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
SECTION 811.    Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
SECTION 812.    Control by Holders of Securities.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing in respect of a series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series; provided, however, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to more than one series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all such series, considered as one class, shall have the right to make such direction, and not the Holders of the Securities of any one of such series; and provided, further, that
(a)    such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where indemnity would not, in the Trustee's sole discretion, be adequate, and
(b)    the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
SECTION 813.    Waiver of Past Defaults.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default
(a)    in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security of such series, or
(b)    in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Section 1202 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any and all Events of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 814.    Undertaking for Costs.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee agree, and each Holder by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company or the Guarantor, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all seri es in respect of which such suit may be brought, considered as one class, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
SECTION 815.    Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws.
Each of the Company and the Guarantor covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company and the Guarantor (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 901.    Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a)    Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series,
(i)    the Trustee undertakes to perform, with respect to Securities of such series, such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii)    in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may, with respect to Securities of such series, conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
(b)    In case an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall exercise, with respect to the Securities of such series, such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(c)    No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i)    this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section;
(ii)    the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(iii)   the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any one or more series, as provided herein, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; and
(iv)    no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

(e)    If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause (other than as contemplated in clause (y) in subsection (d) of this Section), with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company and the Guarantor, by Board Resolutions, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time (subject to Section 914) there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 911. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Ho lders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 911, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company and the Guarantor.

Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
SECTION 911.    Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
(a)    In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of all series, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company, the Guarantor and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company, the Guarantor or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of all sums owed to it, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

Should any written instrument or instruments from the Company or the Guarantor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee to more fully confirm to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be.
Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following conditions:

(c)    the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the concurrence of the Company and the Guarantor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Company or the Guarantor. Upon the written request of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor shall join with the Trustee in the execution and delivery of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section;

(e)    any Act of Holders delivered to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.
SECTION 915    Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents acceptable to the Company with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series or Tranche, and any Guarantee to be endorsed thereon, issued upon original issuance, exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities, and any Guarantees endorsed thereon, so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities or the Guarantee by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and the Guarantor and shall at all times be a Corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any State or Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any Corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such Corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent, the Company and the Guarantor. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and the Guarantor. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
The provisions of Sections 308, 904 and 905 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.
If an appointment with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, shall be made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series or Tranche may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication substantially in the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
If all of the Securities of a series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Securities upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), shall appoint, in accordance with this Section and in accordance with such procedures as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Securities.
SECTION 1001.    Lists of Holders.
Semiannually, not later than June 1 and December 1 in each year, commencing December 1, 2006, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee information as to the names and addresses of the Holders, and the Trustee shall preserve such information and similar information received by it in any other capacity and afford to the Holders access to information so preserved by it, all to such extent, if any, and in such manner as shall be required by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that no such list need be furnished so long as the Trustee shall be the Security Registrar.
SECTION 1002.    Reports by Trustee, Company and Guarantor.
Not later than July 15 in each year, commencing July 15, 2007, the Trustee shall transmit to the Holders, the Commission and each securities exchange upon which any Securities are listed, a report, dated as of the next preceding May 15, with respect to any events and other matters described in Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, in such manner and to the extent required by the Trust Indenture Act. The Trustee shall transmit to the Holders, the Commission and each securities exchange upon which any Securities are listed, and the Company and the Guarantor, as the case requires, shall file with the Trustee (within 30 days after filing with the Commission in the case of reports which pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act must be filed with the Commission and furnished to the Trustee) and transmit to the Holders, such other information, reports and other documents, if any, at such times and in such manner, as shall be required by the Trust Indenture Act. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the listing of any Securities on any securities exchange or of the delisting thereof.
SECTION 1101.    Company or Guarantor May Consolidate, etc., Only on Certain Terms.
Neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity, or convey or otherwise transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless

(b)    immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and

SECTION 1102.    Successor Entity Substituted.
Upon any consolidation by the Company or the Guarantor with or merger by the Company or the Guarantor into any other Person or any conveyance, or other transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Company or the Guarantor substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 1101, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is merged or the Person to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, herein, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities Outstanding hereunder (or the Guarantees endorsed thereon, as the case may be).

(x)    if any such amendment shall require one or more changes to any provisions hereof or the inclusion herein of any additional provisions, or shall by operation of law be deemed to effect such changes or incorporate such provisions by reference or otherwise, this Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended so as to conform to such amendment to the Trust Indenture Act, and the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Holders, enter into an indenture supplemental hereto to effect or evidence such changes or additional provisions; or
(y)    if any such amendment shall permit one or more changes to, or the elimination of, any provisions hereof which, at the date of the execution and delivery hereof or at any time thereafter, are required by the Trust Indenture Act to be contained herein, this Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended to effect such changes or elimination, and the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Holders, enter into an indenture supplemental hereto to evidence such amendment hereof.
SECTION 1202.    Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.
With the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding under this Indenture, considered as one class, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, when authorized by Board Resolutions, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, this Indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under the Indenture; provided, however, that if there shall be Securities of more than one series Outstanding hereunder and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that if the Securities of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if the proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that no such supplemental indenture shall:
(a)    change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on (except as provided in Section 312 hereof), any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon (or the amount of any installment of interest thereon) or change the method of calculating such rate or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of a Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 802, or change the coin or currency (or other property), in which any Security or any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity of any Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or impair the right to receive payments under the Guarantee or to institute suit for the enfo rcement of any such payment under the Guarantee, without, in any such case, the consent of the Holder of such Security, or
(b)    reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series or any Tranche thereof, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the Holders of which is required for any waiver of compliance with any provision of this Indenture or of any default hereunder and its consequences, or reduce the requirements of Section 1304 for quorum or voting, without, in any such case, the consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Security of such series or Tranche, or
(c)    modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 607 or Section 813 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, or except to increase the percentages in principal amount referred to in this Section or such other Sections or to provide that other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 911(b), 914 and 1201(h).
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or of one or more Tranches thereof, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series or Tranches with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series or Tranche.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. A waiver by a Holder of such Holder's right to consent under this Section shall be deemed to be a consent of such Holder.
SECTION 1203.    Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 901) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, immunities or liabilities under this Indenture or otherwise.
SECTION 1204.    Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. Any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article may restate this Indenture in its entirety, and, upon the execution and delivery thereof, any such restatement shall supersede this Indenture as theretofore in effect for all purposes.
SECTION 1205.    Conformity With Trust Indenture Act.
Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.
SECTION 1206.   Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.
Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company and the Guarantor shall so determine, new Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company with the Guarantees endorsed thereon and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series or Tranche.
SECTION 1207.    Modification Without Supplemental Indenture.
If the terms of any particular series of Securities shall have been established in a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a Board Resolution as contemplated by Section 301, and not in an indenture supplemental hereto, additions to, changes in or the elimination of any of such terms may be effected by means of a supplemental Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate, as the case may be, delivered to, and accepted in writing by, the Trustee; provided, however, that such supplemental Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate shall not be accepted by the Trustee or otherwise be effective unless all conditions set forth in this Indenture which would be required to be satisfied if such additions, changes or elimination were contained in a supplemental indenture shall have been appropriately satisfied. Upon the acceptance thereof by the Trustee, any such supplemental Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate shall be deemed to be a "supplemental indenture" for purposes of Sections 1204 and 1206.

Each copy shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such copy shall be delivered to each of the Company, the Guarantor, and the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting. Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated.
SECTION 1307.    Action Without Meeting.
In lieu of a vote of Holders at a meeting as hereinbefore contemplated in this Article, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be made, given or taken by Holders by written instruments as provided in Section 104.
SECTION 1401.    Guarantee.
Subject to the terms of this Article, the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and to the Trustee on behalf of such Holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such Security and of this Indenture, regardless of any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim that the Guarantor may have (except the defense of payment). In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such p ayment were made by the Company. The Guarantor's obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by the Guarantor to the Holder of the Security or to a Paying Agent, or by causing the Company to pay such amount to such Holder or a Paying Agent.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its payment obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or this Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or this Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto (except that the Guarantor will have the benefit of any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company in accordance with this Indenture), by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security, or increase the interest rate thereon, or change any redemption provisions thereof (including any c hange to increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof), or change the Stated Maturity thereof, or increase the principal amount of any Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration or the maturity thereof pursuant to Article Eight of this Indenture.
The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or any of the Holders exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person, the filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to any Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of any Security except by complete performance of the payment obligations contained in such Security and in this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall constitute a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Guarantor hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security, whether at its Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Security, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Indenture, directly against the Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company.
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to any Security shall be continuing and irrevocable until the date upon which the entire principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Security has been, or has been deemed pursuant to the provisions of Article Seven of this Indenture to have been, paid in full or otherwise discharged.
The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders of the Securities upon which its Guarantee is endorsed against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor on account of such Securities pursuant to the provisions of its Guarantee or this Indenture; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all Securities issued hereunder which then are due and payable shall have been paid in full.
This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue notwithstanding any petition filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, the Company becoming insolvent or making an assignment for the benefit of creditors or a receiver or trustee being appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's property and assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of any Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any Holder of such Security, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any such payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned on a Security, such Security shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reins tated and deemed paid only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
SECTION 1402.    Guarantee Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor.
The Guarantor, for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees, and each Holder of the Securities of each series, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the payment under the Guarantee of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on each and all of the Securities is hereby expressly subordinated and junior in right of payment and subject, to the extent and in the manner set forth in this Article, in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor. However, the Guarantee will rank equally in right of payment with any Pari Passu Securities of the Guarantor.
Each Holder of the Securities of each series, by its acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article, and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
SECTION 1403.    Payment Over of Proceeds of Securities.
In the event (a) of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings in respect of the Guarantor or a substantial part of its property and assets, or of any proceedings for liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Guarantor, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (b) subject to the provisions of Section 1404, that (i) a default shall have occurred with respect to the payment of principal of or interest on or other monetary amounts due and payable on any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, or (ii) there shall have occurred a default (other than a default in the payment of principal or interest or other monetary amounts due and payable) in respect of any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, as defined therein or in the instrument under which the same is outstanding, permitting the holder or holders thereof, or any other Person on its or their behalf to accelerate the payment or maturity the reof (with notice or lapse of time, or both), and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, in respect thereof, and, in the cases of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (b), such default shall not have been cured or waived or shall not have ceased to exist, or (c) that the principal of and/or premium, if any, and/or accrued interest on the Securities of any series shall have been declared due and payable pursuant to Section 801 and such declaration shall not have been rescinded and annulled as provided in Section 802, then:
(1)    the holders of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor shall first be entitled to receive payment of the full amount due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Securities are entitled to receive a payment on account of the Guarantee of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities, including, without limitation, any payments made pursuant to Articles Four and Five;
(2)    any payment by, or distribution of property or assets of, the Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which any Holder or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribu tion (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities or to the Trustee under the Guarantee and this Indenture; and

Exhibit 4(b)
Robert Steven Schauer, an Assistant Treasurer of FPL Group Capital Inc (the "Company"), and Robert Steven Schauer, an Assistant Treasurer of FPL Group, Inc. (the "Guarantor"), pursuant to the authority granted in the accompanying Board Resolutions (all capitalized terms used herein which are not defined herein or in Exhibit A hereto, but are defined in the Indenture referred to below, shall have the meanings specified in the Indenture), and Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture, do hereby certify to The Bank of New York (the "Trustee"), as Trustee under the Indenture of the Company (For Unsecured Subordinated Debt Securities) dated as of September 1, 2006 (the "Indenture") that:
The securities to be issued under the Indenture shall be designated "Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066" (the "Debentures of the First Series") and shall be issued in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto;
The Debentures of the First Series shall mature and the principal shall be due and payable together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon on October 1, 2066 (the "Stated Maturity");
The Debentures of the First Series will bear interest at the rate of 6.60% per annum, and will bear interest on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest, at a rate equal to the interest rate borne by the Debentures of the First Series ("Additional Interest"), compounded quarterly, payable (subject to the provisions contained in paragraph 9 below) quarterly in arrears on the 1st day of January, April, July and October of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on January 1, 2007 to the Persons in whose names the Debentures of the First Series are registered, subject to certain exceptions, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date;
The amount of interest payable for any quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any period shorter than a full quarterly period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30-day calendar months). If an Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of the Debentures of the First Series falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable;
Registration and registration of transfers and exchanges in respect of the Debentures of the First Series may be effected at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, New York. Notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debentures of the First Series may be served at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, New York. The Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee will initially be the agency of the Company for such payment, registration and registration of transfers and exchanges and service of notices and demands and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes; provided, however, that the Company reserves the right to change, by one or more Officer's Certificates, any such office or agency and such agent. The Trustee will initially be the Security Registrar and the Paying Agent for the Debentures of the First Series;
The Regular Record Date for the interest payable on any given Interest Payment Date with respect to the Debentures of the First Series shall be the close of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding such Interest Payment Date, provided that if the Debentures of the First Series are held by a securities depository in book-entry form, the Regular Record Date will be the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date;
The Debentures of the First Series will be redeemable at the option of the Company before October 1, 2011, at any time in whole and from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price described in the form of the Debentures of the First Series set forth as Exhibit A hereto;
On or after October 1, 2011, the Debentures of the First Series will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole and from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date;
If before October 1, 2011 a Tax Event (as defined in the form of the Debentures of the First Series set forth as Exhibit A hereto) shall occur and be continuing, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Debentures of the First Series, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of the Tax Event, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date;
So long as any Debentures of the First Series are Outstanding, the failure of the Company to pay interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on any Debentures of the First Series within 30 days after the same becomes due and payable (whether or not payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of Article Fourteen and Article Fifteen of the Indenture) shall constitute an Event of Default; provided, however, that a valid deferral of the interest payments by the Company as contemplated in Section 312 of the Indenture and paragraph 9 of this Certificate shall not constitute a failure to pay interest for this purpose;
Pursuant to Section 312 of the Indenture, so long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Debentures of the First Series, to defer the payment of interest for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an "Optional Deferral Period"); provided that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date. During the Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided for in Exhibit A hereto, as if the interest payment had not been so deferred) will be compounded quarterly. Any deferred interest on the Debentures of the First Series will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the interest rate borne by the Debentures of the First Series , to the extent permitted by applicable law. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, including Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, to the Person in whose name the Debentures of the First Series are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. With respect to the Debentures of First Series, the term "Interest Period" shall mean each period from, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, except that the first Interest Period shall commence on the date of original issuance. However, during any such Optional Deferral Period, neither the Guarantor nor the Company shall:
declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock,
redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its capital stock,
pay any principal, interest or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities that are equal or junior in right of payment to the Debentures of the First Series or the Guarantee (as the case may be), or
make any payments with respect to any guarantee of debt securities if such guarantee is equal or junior in right of payment to the Debentures of the First Series or the Guarantee (as the case may be).
The foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Guarantor or the Company from making:
purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;
any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clauses (A) and (B) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock;
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts;
dividends or distributions paid or made in its capital stock (or rights to acquire its capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts);
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future;
payments under any preferred trust securities guarantee or guarantee of subordinated debentures executed and delivered by the Guarantor concurrently with the issuance by a trust of any preferred trust securities, so long as the amount of payments made on any preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is paid on all preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full distributions to which each series of preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is then entitled;
payments under any guarantee of junior subordinated debentures, which guarantee is executed and delivered by the Guarantor (including a Guarantee under the Indenture), so long as the amount of payments made on any junior subordinated debentures is paid on all junior subordinated debentures then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of junior subordinated debentures is then entitled,
dividends or distributions by the Company on its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor; or
redemptions, purchases, acquisitions or liquidation payments by the Company with respect to its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor.
Prior to the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that such Optional Deferral Period together with all such previous and further deferrals of interest payments shall not exceed 10 consecutive years at any one time or extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Debentures of the First Series. Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof. The Company will give the Trustee notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the applicable Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will promptly forward notice of such election to each Holder of record of the Debentures of the First Series;
The Debentures of the First Series will be initially issued in global form registered in the name of Cede & Co. (as nominee for The Depository Trust Company). The Debentures of the First Series in global form shall bear the depository legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto. The Debentures of the First Series in global form will contain restrictions on transfer, substantially as described in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto;
No service charge shall be made for the registration of transfer or exchange of the Debentures of the First Series; provided, however, that the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with the exchange or transfer;
If the Company shall make any deposit of money and/or Eligible Obligations with respect to any Debentures of the First Series, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, as contemplated by Section 701 of the Indenture, the Company shall not deliver an Officer's Certificate described in clause (z) in the first paragraph of said Section 701 unless the Company shall also deliver to the Trustee, together with such Officer's Certificate, either:
an instrument wherein the Company, notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of its indebtedness in respect of the Debentures of the First Series, shall assume the obligation (which shall be absolute and unconditional) to irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent such additional sums of money, if any, or additional Eligible Obligations (meeting the requirements of Section 701), if any, or any combination thereof, at such time or times, as shall be necessary, together with the money and/or Eligible Obligations theretofore so deposited, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest due and to become due on such Debentures of the First Series or portions thereof, all in accordance with and subject to the provisions of said Section 701; provided, however, that such instrument may state that the obligation of the Company to make additional deposits as aforesaid shall be subject to the delivery to the Company by the Trustee of a notice asserting the deficiency accompanied b y an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Trustee, showing the calculation thereof; or
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as a result of (i) the receipt by the Company from, or the publication by, the Internal Revenue Service of a ruling or (ii) a change in law occurring after the date of this certificate, the Holders of such Debentures of the First Series, or portions of the principal amount thereof, will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, at the same times and in the same manner as if such satisfaction and discharge had not been effected;
The Company reserves the right to require legends on Debentures of the First Series as it may determine are necessary to ensure compliance with the securities laws of the United States and the states therein and any other applicable laws;
The Debentures of the First Series shall have such other terms and provisions as are provided in the form set forth as Exhibit A hereto;
The undersigned has read all of the covenants and conditions contained in the Indenture relating to the issuance of the Debentures of the First Series and the definitions in the Indenture relating thereto and in respect of which this certificate is made;

In the opinion of the undersigned, such conditions and covenants and conditions precedent, if any (including any covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent) to the authentication and delivery of the Debentures of the First Series requested in the accompanying Company Order No. 1 and Guarantor Order No. 1, have been complied with.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed this Officer's Certificate on behalf of the Company this 19th day of September, 2006 in New York, New York.

FPL GROUP CAPITAL INC, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida (herein referred to as the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to____________________, or registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________ Dollars on October 1, 2066 (the "Stated Maturity"). The Company further promises to pay to the registered Holder of this Security (a) interest on said principal sum (subject to deferral as set forth herein) at the rate of 6.60% per annum, in like coin or currency, quarterly in arrears on the 1st day of January, April, July and October of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date") commencing January 1, 2007, from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date hereof to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (unless (i) no interest has yet been paid or duly provided for on this Security, in which case from September 19, 2006, or (ii) the date hereof is befo re an Interest Payment Date but after the Regular Record Date (as defined below) next preceding such Interest Payment Date, in which case from such following Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that if the Company shall default in payment of the interest due on such following Interest Payment Date, then from the next preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or if no interest has yet been paid or duly provided for on this Security, in which case from September 19, 2006), until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for, plus (b) Additional Interest, as defined in the Officer's Certificate, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on any interest payment that is not made on the applicable Interest Payment Date, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the interest rate borne by this Security, compounded quarterly. No interest will accrue on the Securities of this series with respect to the day on which the Securities of this series mature. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be payable to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the "Regular Record Date" for such interest installment which shall be the close of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding such Interest Payment Date, provided that if the Securities are held by a securities depository in book-entry form, the Regular Record Date will be the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, and provided further that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder of this Security on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York, the State of New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company, interest on this Security may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto, as such address shall appear on the Security Register or by a wire transfer to an account designated by the Person entitled thereto.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
FPL GROUP, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida (the "Guarantor", which term includes any successor under the Indenture (the "Indenture") referred to in the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed), for value received, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Holder of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on such Security when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such Security and of the Indenture regardless of any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim that the Guarantor may have (except the defense of payment). In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company. The Guarantor's obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by the Guarantor to the Holder of the Security or to a Paying Agent, or by causing the Company to pay such amount to such Holder or a Paying Agent.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its payment obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or the Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or the Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto (except that the Guarantor will have the benefit of any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company in accordance with the Indenture), by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security, or increase the interest rate thereon (including Additional Interest, if any), or change any redemption provisions the reof (including any change to increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof) or change the Stated Maturity thereof.
The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or the Holder of such Security exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person, the filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Security except by complete performance of the payment obligations contained in such Security and in this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall constitute a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Guarantor hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Security, whether at its Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, legal pro ceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Security, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, directly against the Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company.
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to such Security shall be continuing and irrevocable until the date upon which the entire principal of, premium, if any, and interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on such Security has been, or has been deemed pursuant to the provisions of Article Seven of the Indenture to have been, paid in full or otherwise discharged.
The obligations evidenced by this Guarantee are, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, and this Guarantee is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of a Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of a Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee or the Indenture; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all Securities issued under the Indenture which are then due and payable shall have been paid in full.
This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue notwithstanding any petition filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, the Company becoming insolvent or making an assignment for the benefit of creditors or a receiver or trustee being appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's property and assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Holder of such Security, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any such payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned on such Security, such Security shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and dee med paid only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.
This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this instrument to be duly executed in New York, New York.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Subordinated Debt Securities), dated as of September 1, 2006 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), among the Company, FPL Group, Inc. and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officer's Certificate filed with the Trustee on September 19, 2006, creating the series designated on the face hereof (herein called, the "Officer's Certificate"), for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Sec urities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
In addition to the option of the Company to redeem the Securities of this series in connection with a Tax Event described below, this Security shall be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to the Stated Maturity, upon notice, mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), at a price (the "Redemption Price") as follows: (i) if redeemed prior to October 1, 2011, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus a premium, if any (the "Make-Whole Premium"), or (ii) if redeemed on or after October 1, 2011, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securit ies being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
(1) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
(a) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring during the period from the Redemption Date to October 1, 2011 (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
(b) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the Stated Maturity of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over
(2) the principal amount of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed.
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 25 basis points.
The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC or Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee at the expense of the Company (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker").
provided
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to October 1, 2011 of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Treasury Yield will be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation wi ll be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
If before October 1, 2011 a Tax Event (as defined below) shall occur and be continuing, the Company shall have the right to redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of the Tax Event, at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any including Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption.
"Tax Event" means the receipt by the Guarantor or the Company of an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such tax matters to the effect that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, clarification of, or change (including any announced prospective change) in the laws or treaties (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authorities thereof or therein; (b) any judicial decision or any official administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure, notice or announcement (including any notice or announcement of intent to issue or adopt any such administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure or regulation) (each, an "Administrative Action"), or (c) any amendment to, clarification of, or change in the official position or the interpretation of any such Administrative Action or judicial decision or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to such Administrative Action or judicial decision that differs from the ther etofore generally accepted position, in each case by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, irrespective of the time or manner in which such amendment, clarification or change is introduced or made known, which amendment, clarification, or change is effective, or which Administrative Action is taken or which judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued, in each case after September 12, 2006, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on this Security is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for United States Federal income tax purposes.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture including the Officer's Certificate described above.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a direction inconsiste nt with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
Pursuant to Section 312 of the Indenture, so long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of this series, to defer the payment of interest for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an "Optional Deferral Period"); provided that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date. During the Optional Deferral Period interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided for on the face hereof, as if the payment of interest had not been so deferred) will be compounded quarterly at the rate of 6.60% per annum. Any deferred interest on the Securities of this series will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the interest rate borne by the Securitie s of this series, to the extent permitted by applicable law. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid hereon, including Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, to the Person in whose name the Securities of this series are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. During any such Optional Deferral Period, neither the Guarantor nor the Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock, (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its capital stock, (iii) pay any principal, interest or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities that are equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities of this series or the Guarantee (as the case may be), or (iv) make any payments with respect to any guarantee of debt securities if such guarantee is equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities of this series or the Guarantee (as the case may be).
The foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Guarantor or the Company from making:
purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;

Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the applicable Interest Payment Date.

(the "Guarantor"), pursuant to the authority granted in the accompanying Board Resolutions (all capitalized terms used herein which are not defined herein or in Exhibit A hereto, but are defined in the Indenture referred to below, shall have the meanings specified in the Indenture), and Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture, do hereby certify to The Bank of New York (the "Trustee"), as Trustee under the Indenture of the Company (For Unsecured Subordinated Debt Securities) dated as of September 1, 2006 (the "Indenture") that:
The securities to be issued under the Indenture shall be designated "Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066" (the "Debentures of the Second Series") and shall be issued in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto;
The Debentures of the Second Series shall mature and the principal shall be due and payable together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon on October 1, 2066 (the "Stated Maturity");
The Debentures of the Second Series will bear interest at (i) the rate of 6.35% per annum (the "Fixed Coupon Rate") until October 1, 2016 (the "Fixed Rate Period"), and (ii) the Three-Month LIBOR Rate (as defined below) plus 2.0675% per annum, reset quarterly on the LIBOR Rate Reset Dates (as defined below) (the "Floating Coupon Rate" and, together with the Fixed Coupon Rate, the "Coupon Rate"), from October 1, 2016 up to, but not including, the Stated Maturity (the "Floating Rate Period"), and will bear interest on any overdue principal at the then prevailing Coupon Rate and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the then prevailing Coupon Rate ("Additional Interest"), compounded semi-annually for the Fixed Rate Period and quarterly for the Floating Rate Period, payable (subject to the provisions contained in paragraph 10 below) semi-annually in arrears on the 1st day of April and October of each year during the Fixed R ate Period and quarterly in arrears on the 1st day of January, April, July and October of each year during the Floating Rate Period (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on April 1, 2007 for the Fixed Rate Period and January 1, 2017 for the Floating Rate Period to the Persons in whose names the Debentures of the Second Series are registered, subject to certain exceptions, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date;
During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any semi-annual period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30-day calendar months), and during the Floating Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any quarterly period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the relevant period divided by 360. During the Fixed Rate Period, if an Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of the Debentures of the Second Series falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable. During the Floating Rate Period, if any Interest Payment Date, other than a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of the Debentures of the Second Series, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. During the Floating Rate Period, if a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of the Debentures of the Second Series falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity. During the Floating Rate Period, if any LIBOR Rate Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. During the Floating Rate Period, the interest rate in effect on any LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on that date and the interest rate applicable to any other day will be the interest rate as reset on the immediately preceding LIBOR Rate Reset Date;

If at least two quotations are provided, then the Three-Month LIBOR Rate will be the average (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) of a percent) of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then the Three-Month LIBOR Rate will be the average (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) of a percent) of the rates quoted a t approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent or its affiliate for loans in U.S. Dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. Dollars in that market at that time.

So long as any Debentures of the Second Series are Outstanding, the failure of the Company to pay interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on any Debentures of the Second Series within 30 days after the same becomes due and payable (whether or not payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of Article Fourteen and Article Fifteen of the Indenture) shall constitute an Event of Default; provided, however, that a valid deferral of the interest payments by the Company as contemplated in Section 312 of the Indenture and paragraph 10 of this Certificate shall not constitute a failure to pay interest for this purpose;
Pursuant to Section 312 of the Indenture, so long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Debentures of the Second Series, to defer the payment of interest for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an "Optional Deferral Period"); provided that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date. During the Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided for in Exhibit A hereto, as if the interest payment had not been so deferred) will be compounded semi-annually during the Fixed Rate Period and quarterly during the Floating Rate Period. Any deferred interest on the Debentures of the Second Series will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the Coupon Rate then applicable to the Debentures of the Second Series, to the extent permitted by applicable law. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, including Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, to the Person in whose name the Debentures of the Second Series are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable.

No interest will accrue on the Securities of this series with respect to the day on which the Securities of this series mature.

While this Security bears interest at a fixed rate, the amount of interest payable on this Security will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30-day calendar months), and while this Security bears interest at the Three- Month LIBOR Rate, the amount of interest payable on this Security for any period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period divided by 360.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

FPL GROUP, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida (the "Guarantor", which term includes any successor under the Indenture (the "Indenture") referred to in the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed), for value received, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Holder of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on such Security when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such Security and of the Indenture regardless of any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim that the Guarantor may have (except the defense of payment). In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company. The Guarantor's obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by the Guarantor to the Holder of the Security or to a Paying Agent, or by causing the Company to pay such amount to such Holder or a Paying Agent.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its payment obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or the Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or the Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto (except that the Guarantor will have the benefit of any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company in accordance with the Indenture), by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security, or increase the interest rate thereon (including Additional Interest, if any), or change any redemption provisions the reof (including any change to increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof) or change the Stated Maturity thereof.
The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or the Holder of such Security exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person, the filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Security except by complete performance of the payment obligations contained in such Security and in this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall constitute a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Guarantor hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Security, whether at its Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, legal pro ceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Security, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, directly against the Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company.
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to such Security shall be continuing and irrevocable until the date upon which the entire principal of, premium, if any, and interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on such Security has been, or has been deemed pursuant to the provisions of Article Seven of the Indenture to have been, paid in full or otherwise discharged.
The obligations evidenced by this Guarantee are, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, and this Guarantee is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of a Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of a Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee or the Indenture; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all Securities issued under the Indenture which are then due and payable shall have been paid in full.
This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue notwithstanding any petition filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, the Company becoming insolvent or making an assignment for the benefit of creditors or a receiver or trustee being appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's property and assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Holder of such Security, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any such payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned on such Security, such Security shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and dee med paid only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.
This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this instrument to be duly executed in New York, New York.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Subordinated Debt Securities), dated as of September 1, 2006 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), among the Company, FPL Group, Inc. and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officer's Certificate filed with the Trustee on September 19, 2006, creating the series designated on the face hereof (herein called, the "Officer's Certificate"), for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Sec urities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
In addition to the option of the Company to redeem the Securities of this series in connection with a Tax Event described below, this Security shall be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to the Stated Maturity, upon notice, mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), at a price (the "Redemption Price") as follows: (i) if redeemed prior to October 1, 2016, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus a premium, if any (the "Make-Whole Premium"), or (ii) if redeemed on or after October 1, 2016, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securit ies being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
(1) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
(a) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring during the period from the Redemption Date to October 1, 2016 (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
(b) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the Stated Maturity of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over
(2) the principal amount of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed.
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 25 basis points.
The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Banc of America Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC , J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc. or Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee at the expense of the Company (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker").
provided
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to October 1, 2016 of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Treasury Yield will be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation wi ll be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
If before October 1, 2016 a Tax Event (as defined below) shall occur and be continuing, the Company shall have the right to redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of the Tax Event, at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any including Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption ("Tax Event Redemption Date") plus a premium, if any (the "Tax Event Make-Whole Premium"). In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Tax Event Redemption Date.
The amount of the Tax Event Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
(1) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Tax Event Redemption Date, of:
(a) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Tax Event Redemption Date to October 1, 2016 (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Tax Event Redemption Date); and
(b) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the final maturity of the Security of this series being redeemed; over
(2) the principal amount of the Security of this series being redeemed.
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Tax Event Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.
The Tax Event Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker in the same manner as the Make-Whole Premium described above.
"Tax Event" means the receipt by the Guarantor or the Company of an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such tax matters to the effect that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, clarification of, or change (including any announced prospective change) in the laws or treaties (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authorities thereof or therein; (b) any judicial decision or any official administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure, notice or announcement (including any notice or announcement of intent to issue or adopt any such administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure or regulation) (each, an "Administrative Action"), or (c) any amendment to, clarification of, or change in the official position or the interpretation of any such Administrative Action or judicial decision or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to such Administrative Action or judicial decision that differs from the ther etofore generally accepted position, in each case by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, irrespective of the time or manner in which such amendment, clarification or change is introduced or made known, which amendment, clarification, or change is effective, or which Administrative Action is taken or which judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued, in each case after September 13, 2006, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on this Security is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for United States Federal income tax purposes.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture including the Officer's Certificate described above.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a direction inconsiste nt with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
Pursuant to Section 312 of the Indenture, so long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of this series, to defer the payment of interest for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an "Optional Deferral Period"); provided that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date. During the Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided for on the face hereof, as if the payment of interest had not been so deferred) will be compounded semi-annually while this Security bears interest at a fixed rate and quarterly while this Security bears interest at the Three-Month LIBOR Rate. Any deferred interest on the Securities of this series will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the Securities of this series, to the extent permitted by applicable law. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid hereon, including Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, to the Person in whose name the Securities of this series are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. During any such Optional Deferral Period, neither the Guarantor nor the Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock, (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its capital stock, (iii) pay a ny principal, interest or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities that are equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities of this series or the Guarantee (as the case may be), or (iv) make any payments with respect to any guarantee of debt securities if such guarantee is equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities of this series or the Guarantee (as the case may be).
The foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Guarantor or the Company from making:
purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;
any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clauses (i) and (ii) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock;
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts;
dividends or distributions paid or made in its capital stock (or rights to acquire its capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts);
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future;
payments under any preferred trust securities guarantee or guarantee of subordinated debentures executed and delivered by the Guarantor concurrently with the issuance by a trust of any preferred trust securities, so long as the amount of payments made on any preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is paid on all preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full distributions to which each series of preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is then entitled;
payments under any guarantee of junior subordinated debentures, which guarantee is executed and delivered by the Guarantor (including a Guarantee under the Indenture), so long as the amount of payments made on any junior subordinated debentures is paid on all junior subordinated debentures then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of junior subordinated debentures is then entitled;
dividends or distributions by the Company on its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor; or
redemptions, purchases, acquisitions or liquidation payments by the Company with respect to its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor.
Prior to the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that such Optional Deferral Period together with all such previous and further deferrals of interest payments shall not exceed 10 consecutive years at any one time or extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Securities of this series. Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the applicable Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will promptly forward notice of such election to each holder of record of the Securities of this series.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor and of authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
