Bank revolving lines of credit available to FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, under these separate credit facilities aggregate $6.5 billion ($4.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $2.5 billion for FPL).  These new credit facilities replaced the previously existing five-year credit facilities which aggregated $4.5 billion ($2.5 billion for FPL Group Capital and $2.0 billion for FPL).  The new credit facilities are available to support the companies' commercial paper programs and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a property loss including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss, as well as for general corporate purposes.  FPL Group (which guarantees the payment of FPL Group Capital's credit facilities pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement) is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization under the terms of FPL Group Capital's credit facility.  FPL is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization under the terms of FPL's credit facility.
