This Supplemental Indenture has been executed in several counterparts, all of which constitute but one and the same instrument.  This Supplemental Indenture has been recorded in several counties and documentary stamp taxes as required by law in the amount of $1,750,000 and non-recurring intangible taxes as required by law in the amount of $120,359.37 were paid on the Supplemental Indenture recorded in the public records of Palm Beach County, Florida.
 
:  The new bonds (New Bonds) being issued in connection with this Supplemental Indenture are secured by real property and personal property located both within Florida and outside of Florida.  The aggregate fair market value of the collateral exceeds the aggregate principal amount of (y) the New Bonds plus (z) the other outstanding bonds secured by the mortgage supplemented hereby and all previous supplemental indentures thereto.  The intangible tax has been computed pursuant to Section 199.133 (2), Florida Statutes, by (i) determining the percentage of the aggregate fair market value of the collateral constituting real property situated in Florida and by multiplying that percentage times the principal amount of the New Bonds (the result hereinafter defined as the Tax Base) and (ii) multiplying the tax rate times the Tax Base.

FPL further covenants and agrees to and with the Trustee and its successors in said trust under the Mortgage, as follows:
 
 
 
Section 1.
 
(I)  There shall be a series of bonds designated 5.96% Series due April 1, 2039, herein sometimes referred to as the , each of which shall also bear the descriptive title First Mortgage Bond, and the form thereof, which shall be established by Resolution of the Board of Directors of FPL, shall contain suitable provisions with respect to the matters hereinafter in this Section specified.  Bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series shall mature on April 1, 2039 and shall be issued as fully registered bonds in denominations of One Thousand Dollars and, at the option of FPL, in integral multiples of One Thousand Dollars (the exercise of such option to be evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof); they shall bear interest at the rate of 5.96% per annum, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year (each an ) commencing on October 1, 2009; the principal of and interest on each said bond to be payable at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.  Bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series shall be dated as in Section 10 of the Mortgage provided.  The record date for payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date shall be the close of business on (1) the business day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date so long as the bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series are held by a securities depository in book-entry only form or (2) the 15th calendar day immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date if the bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series are not held by a securities depository in book-entry only form.  Interest on the bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series will accrue from and including March 17, 2009 to but excluding October 1, 2009 and, thereafter, from and including the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (and if no interest has been paid on the bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series, from March 17, 2009) to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.  No interest will accrue on a bond of the One Hundred Eleventh Series for the day on which such bond matures.  The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the number of days in the period using 30-day calendar months.

(II)
 
Bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series shall be redeemable either at the option of FPL or pursuant to the requirements of the Mortgage (including, among other requirements, the application of cash delivered to or deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of Section 64 of the Mortgage or with proceeds of Released Property) in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to maturity, upon notice, as provided in Section 52 of the Mortgage, mailed at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the ), at a price (the ) equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus a premium, if any (the ).  In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
Redemption Date
Redemption Price
Make-Whole Premium
 
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any bond of the One Hundred Eleventh Series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
 
 
 
 
 
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.  Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 35 basis points.
 
The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by FPL; that if FPL fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Calyon Securities (USA) Inc., Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., or if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee at the expense of FPL (in any such case, an ).

Independent Investment Banker
 
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium,  means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the ).  The Independent Investment Banker will determine the Treasury Yield as of the third business day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
Treasury Yield
Remaining Term
 
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates or any successor release (the ).  If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield.  In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release).  Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation will be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward.  If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
H.15 Statistical Release
 
(III)
 
At the option of the registered owner any bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series, upon surrender thereof for exchange at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, together with a written instrument of transfer wherever required by FPL, duly executed by the registered owner or by his duly authorized attorney, shall (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of bonds of the same series of other authorized denominations.
 
Bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series shall be transferable (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
 
Upon any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series, FPL may make a charge therefor sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge, as provided in Section 12 of the Mortgage, but FPL hereby waives any right to make a charge in addition thereto for any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series.

Section 4.
 
The holders of bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series consent that FPL may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of bonds of the One Hundred Eleventh Series entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver.  If a record date is fixed, those persons who were holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such persons continue to be holders after such record date.  No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.

Section 6.
 
Whenever in this One Hundred Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture either of the parties hereto is named or referred to, this shall, subject to the provisions of Articles XVI and XVII of the Mortgage, as heretofore amended, be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party, and all the covenants and agreements in this One Hundred Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture contained by or on behalf of FPL, or by or on behalf of the Trustee, or either of them, shall, subject as aforesaid, bind and inure to the respective benefits of the respective successors and assigns of such parties, whether so expressed or not.

Make-Whole Premium
 
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
 
(1)           the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
 
(a)           each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring during the period from the Redemption Date to March 1, 2014 (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
 
(b)           the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the Stated Maturity of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over
 
(2)           the principal amount of the Security of this series (or portion thereof)being redeemed.
 
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.  Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 50 basis points.
 
The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC or Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee in consultation with, and at the expense of, the Company (in any such case, an ).

For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium,  means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to March 1, 2014 of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the ).  The Treasury Yield will be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
Treasury Yield
Remaining Term
 
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates or any successor release (the ).  If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield.  In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release).  Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation will be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward.  If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
H.15 Statistical Release
 
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
 
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
If before March 1, 2014 a Tax Event (as defined below) shall occur and be continuing, the Company shall have the right to redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of the Tax Event, at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption.
 
 means the receipt by the Guarantor or the Company of an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such tax matters to the effect that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, clarification of, or change (including any announced prospective change) in the laws or treaties of the United States or any political subdivisions or taxing authorities, or any regulations under such laws or treaties, (b) any judicial decision or any official administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure, notice or announcement (including any notice or announcement of intent to issue or adopt any such administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure or regulation) (each, an ), (c) any amendment to, clarification of, or change in the official position or the interpretation of any such Administrative Action or judicial decision or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to such Administrative Action or judicial decision that differs from the theretofore generally accepted position, in each case by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, irrespective of the time or manner in which such amendment, clarification or change is introduced or made known, or (d) threatened challenge asserted in writing in connection with an audit of the Guarantor or the Company or any of their subsidiaries, or a publicly-known threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the Securities of this series, which amendment, clarification, or change is effective, or which Administrative Action is taken or which judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued or threatened challenge is asserted or becomes publicly-known, in each case after March 12, 2009, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on this Security is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for United States Federal income tax purposes.

In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Rating Agency Event Redemption Date.
Rating Agency Event Redemption Date
Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Premium
 
The amount of the Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
 
(1)           the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Rating Agency Event Redemption Date, of:
 
(a)           each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Rating Agency Event Redemption Date to March 1, 2014 (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Rating Agency Event Redemption Date); and
 
(b)           the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the final maturity of the Security of this series being redeemed; over
 
(2)           the principal amount of the Security of this series being redeemed.
 
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.  Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Rating Agency Event Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined above for the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium) plus 50 basis points.
 
The Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker in the same manner as the Make-Whole Premium described above.
 
 means a change in the methodology employed by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a ), that currently publishes a rating for the Company or the Guarantor in assigning equity credit to securities such as the Securities of this series, as such methodology is in effect on March 12, 2009 (the ""), which change results in (a) the length of time for which such current criteria are scheduled to be in effect being shortened with respect to the Securities of this series, or (b) a lower or higher equity credit being assigned by such Rating Agency to the Securities of this series as of the date of such change than the equity credit that would have been assigned to the Securities of this series as of the date of such change by such Rating Agency pursuant to its current criteria.
