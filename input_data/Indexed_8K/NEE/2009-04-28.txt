FPL Group announces solid first quarter earnings for 2009
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  FPL Group, Inc. (NYSE: FPL) today reported 2009 first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $364 million, or $0.90 per share, compared with $249 million, or $0.62 per share, in the first quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, FPL Groups earnings were $364 million, or $0.90 per share, compared with $305 million, or $0.76 per share, in the first quarter of 2008. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to NextEra Energy Resources.
FPL Group management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether certain performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. FPL Group management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of FPL Groups fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
FPL Group had a very good first quarter, with adjusted earnings per share rising 18 percent year over year, largely as a result of strong results from our NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary. At Florida Power & Light, we announced proposed investments that will significantly improve the electrical system for our customers  specifically, a large-scale deployment of smart grid technology in Miami, and a new natural gas pipeline to provide increased energy security. As pleased as we are with FPL Groups current results, we are even more optimistic about the future. The reason is simple: We believe that the policy climate in the nation is trending in a direction highly favorable to power companies with low emissions profiles and significant clean-energy fleets, said FPL Group Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
 
 
Florida Power & Light
Company
FPL Group's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported first quarter net income of $127 million, or $0.31 per share, compared with $108 million, or $0.27 per share, for the prior-year quarterThe weak economy, however, continued to have a negative impact on FPL. Sales declined for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, as did the average number of customers and usage per customer.
.  
FPLs improved results were driven by a 10 percent reduction in operations and maintenance expenses compared to last years first quarter, with much of that reduction attributable to timing of expenses in 2009.  In addition, in March of this year, FPL, along with certain NextEra Energy Resources subsidiaries, signed a settlement agreement with the U.S. government dismissing lawsuits related to spent nuclear fuel disposal. The total settlement helped FPL Groups net income by about 4 cents per share, half of which was at FPL.
Other key developments:
 
 
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of FPL Group with generating facilities in 25 states and Canada, reported first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $252 million, or $0.62 per share, compared with $164 million, or $0.41 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $252 million, or $0.62 per share, compared with $220 million, or $0.55 per share, in the first quarter of 2008.

NextEra Energy Resources first quarter adjusted earnings per share contribution rose by 13 percent over the prior-year quarter. These results were driven primarily by new investments, specifically new wind generation facilities. Included in this category are the favorable impacts of state investment tax incentives and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Adjusted earnings from the existing portfolio, which includes both the contracted and merchant segments, declined versus the year ago quarter. The contracted segment was down due primarily to a refueling outage at one of our nuclear plants this year and lower earnings at one of the companys natural gas-fired facilities in the Northeast. Earnings from the merchant assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) were down due to softer market conditions, partially offset by incremental contributions from the companys retail provider, Gexa. The merchant assets in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) were up 3 cents owing to the absence of an unplanned outage that occurred during last years first quarter.  The existing wind portfolio was down compared to last years first quarter primarily reflecting a weaker wind resource. NextEra Energy Resources results also benefited from an additional equity investment made in its Canadian operations that allowed the company to reduce previously deferred taxes.
In late January, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved the states Competitive Renewable Energy Zone initiative, a collaborative effort by the PUCT, ERCOT, and interested stakeholders to deliver more renewable wind energy to customers in the state. The PUCT voted to implement an approximately $5 billion transmission build-out, awarding 11 percent of the total, or approximately $565 million, to Lone Star Transmission, an FPL Group subsidiary. Lone Star is expected to add approximately 250 miles of 345 kilovolt lines capable of transporting a significant amount of renewable energy from West Texas to the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.
Corporate and Other
The loss in Corporate and Other declined to $15 million in the first quarter of 2009 from $23 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Outlook
FPL Group believes it is well positioned for earnings growth and now believes the company will deliver adjusted earnings per share for 2009 and 2010 in a higher range than previously announced. For 2009, the new adjusted earnings per share range is $4.20 to $4.40 and for 2010 the new range is $4.65 to $5.05. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of risk factors that may affect future earnings.
As always, FPL Groups adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions, no further decline in the national or Florida economy, a reasonable capital markets atmosphere, and exclude the mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges, OTTI, and the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, if any, none of which can be determined at this time.

(FPL Group) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL in this press release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or performance, climate change strategy or growth strategies (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL. 
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and FPL Group and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on FPL Group's and FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause FPL Group's and FPL's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements:
FPL Group and FPL are subject to complex laws and regulations and to changes in laws and regulations as well as changing governmental policies and regulatory actions.  FPL holds franchise agreements with local municipalities and counties, and must renegotiate expiring agreements.  These factors may have a negative impact on the business and results of operations of FPL Group and FPL.

The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear units owned by FPL or NextEra Energy Resources, and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission facilities involve substantial risks.  Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful or delayed, the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL could be adversely affected.
 
6
 
The use of derivative contracts by FPL Group and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that adversely impact the results of operations or cash flows of FPL Group and FPL.
FPL Group's competitive energy business is subject to risks, many of which are beyond the control of FPL Group, including, but not limited to, the efficient development and operation of generating assets, the successful and timely completion of project restructuring activities, the price and supply of fuel and equipment, transmission constraints, competition from other generators, including those using new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and demand for power, that may reduce the revenues and adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group.
FPL Group's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.
 
7
 
FPL Group and FPL participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth, future income and expenditures.
Customer growth and customer usage in FPL's service area affect FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations.
Weather affects FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations, as can the impact of severe weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, and can affect the production of electricity at power generating facilities.
Adverse capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and increase the cost of capital.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL, as well as exert downward pressure on the market price of FPL Group's common stock.
FPL Groups, FPL Group Capitals and FPLs inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect FPL Groups and FPLs liquidity, limit the ability of FPL Group and FPL to grow their businesses, and would likely increase interest costs.

FPL Group and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from third parties under supply and service contracts.
 
FPL Group and FPL are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as regulatory compliance and changes in or additions to applicable tax laws, rates or policies, rates of inflation, accounting standards, securities laws, corporate governance requirements and labor and employment laws.
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt FPL Group's and FPL's business may impact the operations of FPL Group and FPL in unpredictable ways.
The ability of FPL Group and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The risks described herein are not the only risks facing FPL Group and FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties also may materially adversely affect FPL Group's or FPL's business, financial condition and/or future operating results.
