On May 18, 2009, Heartland Wind II, LLC (Heartland Wind II), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources), entered into an approximately $343 million limited-recourse senior secured variable rate term loan agreement that will fund in full later this week.  NextEra Energy Resources is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc.  Interest on the loan will be payable quarterly and the principal will be partially amortizing with a balloon payment at maturity in May 2017.  The proceeds of the loan will be used to reimburse, in part, capital contributions made by NextEra Energy Resources to develop and construct wind generation facilities totaling 298.5 megawatts and associated transmission facilities located in North Dakota and Iowa. The loan will be secured by liens on those wind generation assets and associated transmission facilities, and certain other assets of, and the ownership interest in, Heartland Wind II. The loan agreement contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to the failure to make required payments, certain events in bankruptcy and other covenants applicable to Heartland Wind II.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date:  May 18, 2009
