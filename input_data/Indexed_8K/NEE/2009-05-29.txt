Any adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rate under this subparagraph (ii) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (A) the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off and (B) in the case of any Spin-Off that is effected simultaneously with an Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off, the date on which the initial public offering price of the securities being offered in such Initial Public Offering is determined.

In case the Company shall, (I) by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash during any quarterly period (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which applies or as part of a distribution referred to in ) in an amount in excess of $0.4725 per share of Common Stock per quarter (the ), immediately after the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing such Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the per share amount of the distribution and the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination minus the Reference Dividend.  The Reference Dividend is subject to adjustment (without duplication) from time to time in a manner inversely proportional to any adjustment made to each Fixed Settlement Rate under Section 5.6(a);provided that no adjustment will be made to the Reference Dividend for any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.6(a)(5).  In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

No adjustment in a Fixed Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  If an adjustment is made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to , an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of Settlement Rate in will apply on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date.  Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by the Adjustment Factor.  The  means, initially, a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after the first adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.6(a) and the denominator shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment.

(10)           The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish the effect of any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons.
 
(11)           If the Company hereafter adopts any shareholder rights plan involving the issuance of preferred share purchase rights or other similar rights (the ) to all holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless such Rights under the future shareholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock prior to the time of settlement of such Purchase Contract, in which case each Settlement Rate shall be adjusted as provided in on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock.

In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Exchange Property Unit that Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units would have been entitled to receive will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election.  The number of Exchange Property Units to be delivered upon settlement of a Purchase Contract following the effective date of a Reorganization Event shall equal the Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 5.6, determined as if the references to shares of Common Stock in were to Exchange Property Units.

Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments to the amount of any securities constituting all or a portion of an Exchange Property Unit which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such Reorganization Event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.6.  The above provisions of this Section 5.6(b) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
 
(ii)           Prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then following such Fundamental Change a Holder of a Unit will have the right to accelerate and settle () its Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate (determined as if the Applicable Market Value equaled the Stock Price), plus an additional make-whole amount of shares (the ); provided that no Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel for the Company, which need not be in the form of a written opinion,) under the Securities Act.  If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement.  In the event that a Holder seeks to exercise its Fundamental Change Early Settlement right and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such right but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holders exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement shall be effective and the Company shall have no further obligation with respect to any such Registration Statement if, notwithstanding using its commercially reasonable efforts, no Registration Statement is then effective.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement
Make-Whole Share Amount
 
If a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, with respect to such Purchase Contracts.  The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
 
Within five Business Days of the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, if such request is delivered at least two Business Days prior to the date such notice is to be given to Holders of Units (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by the Purchase Contract Agent), the Purchase Contract Agent, shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Fundamental Change, which shall specify

(1)           the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) and how and where such notice to settle early should be delivered,
 
(2)           the date on which such Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least ten days after the date of the notice but not later than the earlier of 20 days after the date of such notice or five Business Days prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) (the ),
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date
 
(3)           the amount of cash payable in respect of the exercise of such Fundamental Change Early Settlement (giving effect to the credit for any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the preceding paragraph),
 
(4)            the applicable Settlement Rate,
 
(5)           the Make-Whole Share Amount and
 
(6)           the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder, including any amount of Contract Adjustment Payments receivable upon settlement.
 
The Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent.
 
Corporate Unit Holders (unless Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units) and Treasury Unit Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be.  If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Unit Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) in multiples of 20,000 Corporate Units (or such other number of Corporate Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent upon a Successful Remarketing if the Reset Effective Date is not a Payment Date).  Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of shall apply with respect to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii).
Section 5.1
 
In order to exercise the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office, no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, such Certificate duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early/Fundamental Change Early Settlement on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the product of (1) the Stated Amount times (2) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
 
 
52
 
 
Upon receipt of any such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Fundamental Change Early Settlement by a Holder of Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
 
If a Holder properly effects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.6(b)(ii), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date:
 
(A)           the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Fundamental Change by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Fundamental Change (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time plus the Make-Whole Share Amount), assuming such holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Fundamental Change provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates.  In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Fundamental Change, the kind and amount of securities, cash and/or other property receivable by Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units exercising their right to effect a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election.  For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Fundamental Change shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date;
 
(B)           the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Fundamental Change Early Settlement;
 
(C)           any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments (to the extent such payments are not applied as a credit to the Purchase Price in connection with the settlement of the Purchase Contracts); and
 
(D)           if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.6(b)(ii).
 
The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing provisions will continue to remain Outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
The Make-Whole Share Amounts applicable to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Fundamental
 
 
53
 
Change becomes effective (the ) and the price (the ) paid per share for Common Stock in such Fundamental Change, which will be (a) in the case of a Fundamental Change described in clause (ii) of the definition of such term and the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in such transaction, the Stock Price paid per share will be the cash amount paid per share; or (b) otherwise, the Stock Price paid per share will be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on the twenty Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change.

If the Stock Price or Effective Date applicable to a Fundamental Change is not expressly set forth on the table, then the Make-Whole Share Amount will be determined as follows:
 
(1)           if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is between two dates on the table, the Make-Whole Share Amount will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Share Amounts set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
 
(2)           if the Stock Price is in excess of $200 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in ), then the Make-Whole Share Amount shall be zero; and

Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice thereof to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, and to the Holders at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register.  Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming a part of such Units in the case of Corporate Units, or Treasury Securities in the case of Treasury Units, in accordance with the provisions of .

Unless the context otherwise requires, each provision of this Unit shall be part of the Purchase Contract evidenced hereby.  This Unit and each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2009 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the ), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as purchase contract agent (including any successor thereunder, herein called the ), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Corporate Unit Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
Purchase Contract Agreement
Purchase Contract Agent
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled either through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement, shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the applicable Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly-issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate or the applicable Settlement Rate, as applicable.
 
The  means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day during the Observation Period; provided, however, that if the Company enters into a Reorganization Event, the Applicable Market Value will mean the value of an Exchange Property Unit.  Following the occurrence of any such Reorganization Event, references herein to the purchase or issuance of shares of Common Stock shall be construed to be references to settlement into Exchange Property Units.  For purposes of calculating the value of an Exchange Property Unit, (x) the value of any common stock included in the Exchange Property Unit shall be determined using the average of the Closing Price per share of such common stock on each Trading Day during the Observation Period (only if such common stock has traded on any Trading Day during the Observation Period)(adjusted as set forth under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement) and (y) the value of any other property, including securities other than common stock included in the Exchange Property Unit, shall be the value of such property on the first Trading Day of the Observation Period (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution).  The  of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the ) on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the Pink OTC Markets Inc. or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose.  A  means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or over-the-counter market that is the primary market

In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby shall pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement.  A Holder of Corporate Units who does not make such payment in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement or who does not notify the Purchase Contract Agent of such Holders intention, at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to make an effective Cash Settlement or an Early Settlement, shall have defaulted in its obligations under the related Purchase Contract.  If a Holder of Corporate Units fails to notify the Purchase Contract Agent of such Holders intention to effect a Cash Settlement in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement, such failure shall constitute a default under the related Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures pursuant to the Remarketing during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period described in the Purchase Contract Agreement.  If a Holder of Corporate Units does notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement but fails to deliver cash to pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement, such failure shall also constitute a default under the Purchase Contract; however, the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures of such a Holder will not be remarketed but instead the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures to satisfy the Holders obligations under such Purchase Contract to purchase Common Stock at the Purchase Price.  If there is no Successful Remarketing during the Period for Early Remarketing and if all the Remarketings during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period result in Failed Remarketings in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Failed Remarketing on the last Remarketing Date during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period shall constitute a default under the related Purchase Contracts by such Holder and the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures to satisfy the Holders obligations under such Purchase Contract to purchase Common Stock at the Purchase Price.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
 
Under and subject to the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below in this paragraph.  Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Debentures are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Debentures, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Corporate Units a notice
 
 
 
 
(a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each Corporate Unit Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Debentures entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures constituting a part of such Holders Corporate Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given.  Upon the written request of the Holders of Corporate Units on such record date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Debentures as to which any particular voting instructions are received.  In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of Corporate Units, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures constituting a part of such Corporate Units.
Upon the occurrence of (i) a Mandatory Redemption where the related Purchase Contracts have not been previously or concurrently terminated in accordance with Section 5.8 of the Purchase Contract Agreement or (ii) a Special Event Redemption, in each case, prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Redemption Price equal to the Redemption Amount together with any accrued and unpaid interest payable on the Mandatory Redemption Date or the Special Event Redemption Date, as the case may be, with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent in exchange for the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures.  Pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will apply an amount equal to the Redemption Amount to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such Redemption Price, if any, to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units.  The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Applicable Ownership in Debentures, and will be held by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Corporate Unit to purchase the Common Stock on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date under the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Corporate Unit.  Following the occurrence of a Mandatory Redemption or a Special Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V, and VI, of the Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Debentures shall be deemed to be reference to such Treasury Portfolio.  The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Unit Certificate therewith to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio for the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures as Collateral.
 
The Corporate Unit Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof.  The transfer of any Corporate Unit Certificate will be registered and Corporate Unit Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.  The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement.  No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
 
 
 
 
 
exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.  A Holder who elects to substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith.  Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Corporate Unit remains in effect, such Corporate Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Unit in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the Purchase Contract comprising such Corporate Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged only as an entire Corporate Unit.  The holder of any Corporate Units may substitute for the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) securing its obligation under the related Purchase Contract, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or Stated Amount of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.  From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Security secures the Holders obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a .  A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units for 20 Treasury Units; provided, however, that if a Special Event Redemption or a Mandatory Redemption or a Successful Early Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may make such Collateral Substitutions only in integral multiples of 20,000 Corporate Units for 20,000 Treasury Units (or such other number of Treasury Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent in connection with a Successful Remarketing of the Debentures if the Reset Effective Date is not a Payment Date).
Treasury Unit
 
A Holder of Treasury Units may create or recreate Corporate Units by depositing with the Collateral Agent the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, with a Stated Amount, in the case of such Debentures, or with the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), in the case of such Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such Pledged Treasury Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
 
Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date  the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Corporate Unit Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Security Register at the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date.  The Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated in writing by such person.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date to any subsequent Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred and the expected Deferral Period) as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.  Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 8.375% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the ).  Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement.  No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.
Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments
 
In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing other than:
 
(i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that payment of Contract Adjustment Payments are deferred requiring the Company to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock,

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 
 
Dated:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is one of the Treasury Unit Certificates referred to in the within mentioned Purchase Contract Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, each provision of this Unit shall be part of the Purchase Contract evidenced hereby.  This Unit and each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2009 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the Purchase Contract Agreement), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as purchase contract agent (including any successor thereunder, herein called the Purchase Contract Agent), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Treasury Unit Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled either through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement, shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the applicable Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly-issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate or the applicable Settlement Rate, as applicable.
 
The  means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day during the Observation Period; provided, however, that if the Company enters into a Reorganization Event, the Applicable Market Value will mean the value of an Exchange Property Unit.  Following the occurrence of any such Reorganization Event, references herein to the purchase or issuance of shares of Common Stock shall be construed to be references to settlement into Exchange Property Units.  For purposes of calculating the value of an Exchange Property Unit, (x) the value of any common stock included in the Exchange Property Unit shall be determined using the average of the Closing Price per share of such common stock on each Trading Day during the Observation Period (only if such common stock has traded on any Trading Day during the Observation Period)(adjusted as set forth under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement) and (y) the value of any other property, including securities other than common stock included in the Exchange Property Unit, shall be the value of such property on the first Trading Day of the Observation Period (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution).  The  of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the ) on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the Pink OTC Markets Inc. or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose.  A  means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock at the close of business.  If the Common Stock is not traded

In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby shall pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement.  A Holder of Treasury Units who does not make such payment in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement or who does not notify the Purchase Contract Agent of such Holders intention at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to make an effective Cash Settlement or an Early Settlement, shall have defaulted in its obligations under the related Purchase Contract. If a Holder of Treasury Units fails to notify the Purchase Contract Agent of such Holders intention to effect a Cash Settlement in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement such failure shall constitute a default under the related Purchase Contract.  If a Holder of Treasury Units does notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement but fails to deliver cash to pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement, such failure shall also constitute a default under the Purchase Contract.  If any such default occurs, upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities held by the Collateral Agent on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the principal amount of the Treasury Securities received by the Collateral Agent will be invested promptly in overnight Permitted Investments.  On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date an amount equal to the Purchase Price will be remitted to the Company in settlement of the Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement without receiving any instructions from the Holder.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
 
The Treasury Unit Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof.  The transfer of any Treasury Unit Certificate will be registered and Treasury Unit Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.  The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement.  No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.  A Holder who elects to substitute the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for Treasury Securities, thereby creating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith.  Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract comprising such Treasury Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as an entire
 
 
 
 
 
Treasury Unit. The holder of any Treasury Units may substitute for the Treasury Securities securing its obligation under the related Purchase Contract, the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.  From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) secures the Holders obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a Corporate Unit.  A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units for 20 Corporate Units; provided, however, that if a Special Event Redemption or a Mandatory Redemption or a Successful Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may make such Collateral Substitutions only in integral multiples of 20,000 Treasury Units for 20,000 Corporate Units (or such other number of Corporate Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent in connection with a Successful Remarketing of the Debentures if the Reset Effective Date is not a Payment Date).
 
A Holder of a Corporate Unit may, at any time, on or prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, create or recreate a Treasury Unit by substituting Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) that form a part of such Corporate Unit, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
 
Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Treasury Unit Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Security Register at the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date.  The Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated in writing by such person.
 
The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date to any subsequent Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred and the expected Deferral Period) as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.  Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 8.375% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments).  Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement.  No Contract
 
 
 
 
 
Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.
 
In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing other than:
 
(i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that payment of Contract Adjustment Payments are deferred requiring the Company to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock,
 
(ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Companys capital stock or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of the Companys capital stock for another class or series of the Companys capital stock,
 
(iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Companys capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of the Companys capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts,
 
(iv) dividends or distributions paid or made in capital stock of the Company (or rights to acquire capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Companys capital stock and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts) or
 
(v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future.
 
The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the rights and obligations of the Holders to purchase shares of Common Stock will immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred.  Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register.  Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may settle the related Purchase Contracts in their entirety at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period in the manner prescribed herein, but only in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units.  In order to exercise the right to effect any such early settlement (Early Settlement) with respect to any Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Treasury Unit Certificate, the Holder of this Treasury Unit Certificate shall deliver this Treasury Unit Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early/ Fundamental Change Early Settlement set forth below duly completed and executed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the Early Settlement Amount) equal to the sum of (i) $50 times the number of Purchase Contracts being settled, plus (ii) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date relating to any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable, if any, on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts; provided that no payment is required if the Company has elected to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments which would otherwise be payable on the Payment Date.

In accordance with , unless a Successful Remarketing or a Special Event Redemption or a Mandatory Redemption has previously occurred, Holders of Treasury Units shall not be permitted to effect Collateral Substitutions during the period commencing on and including the Business Day prior to the first of the three sequential Remarketing Dates comprising a Three-Day Remarketing Period and ending on and including the Reset Date relating to a Successful Remarketing during such Three-Day Remarketing Period or, if none of the Remarketings during such Three-Day Remarketing Period is successful, the Business Day following the last of the three sequential Remarketing Dates occurring during such Three-Day Remarketing Period.

Exhibit B
Exhibit A
 
Upon receipt of the Debenture or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, described in clause (a) or (b) above and the instructions described in clause (c) above from the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities and shall promptly Transfer such Pledged Treasury Securities, free and clear of the lien, pledge or security interest created hereby, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders.
 
 
Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of written notice from the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent that there has occurred a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release all Collateral from the Pledge and shall promptly Transfer any Debentures underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures (or, if (i) a Special Event Redemption, (ii) a Mandatory Redemption if the proceeds thereof were used to acquire the Treasury Portfolio in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement or (iii) a Successful Remarketing, as the case may be, has occurred, the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio) and Pledged Treasury Securities to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Corporate Units and the Treasury Units, respectively, free and clear of any lien, pledge or security interest or other interest created hereby.
 
If such Termination Event shall result from the Companys becoming a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, and if the Collateral Agent shall for any reason fail promptly to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, as provided by this Section 4.3, any Holder may, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall, upon receipt from the Holders of security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by the Purchase Contract Agent in compliance with this paragraph, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of a nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent to the effect that, as a result of the Company being the debtor in such a bankruptcy case, the Collateral Agent will not be prohibited from releasing or Transferring the Collateral as provided in this Section 4.3, and shall deliver such opinion to the Collateral Agent within ten days after the occurrence of such
 
13
 
Termination Event, and if (A) any such Holder or the Purchase Contract Agent shall be unable to obtain such opinion within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event or (B) the Collateral Agent shall continue, after delivery of such opinion, to refuse to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 4.3, then any Holder may, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall within 15 days after the occurrence of such Termination Event, commence an action or proceeding in the court with jurisdiction of the Companys case under the Bankruptcy Code seeking an order requiring the Collateral Agent to effectuate the release and transfer of all Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or of the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, as provided by this Section 4.3 or (ii) commence an action or proceeding in the court with jurisdiction of the Companys case under the Bankruptcy Code like that described in clause (i)(B) of this Section 4.3 within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event.

If all the Remarketings during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period result in Failed Remarketings as described in , such Failed Remarketings shall constitute a default under the related Purchase Contracts by such Holder, and the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures at the direction of the Company to retain or dispose of the Collateral in accordance with applicable law.

If a Holder of Treasury Units or Corporate Units (if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units) fails to notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement in accordance with , or if a Holder of Treasury Units or Corporate Units (if the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units) notifies the Purchase Contract Agent as provided in of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, but fails to make such payment as required by , such failure shall constitute a default under the related Purchase Contracts by such Holder and upon the maturity of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, if any, held by the Collateral Agent on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the principal amount of such Pledged Treasury Securities, or the portion of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, corresponding to such Purchase Contracts received by the Collateral Agent shall, upon written direction of the Company, be invested promptly in Permitted Investments.  On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price will be remitted to the Company as payment of the Purchase Price of such Purchase Contracts.  In the event the sum of the Proceeds from the Pledged Treasury Securities or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the investment earnings earned from the Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent will distribute such excess to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holder of the related Treasury Units or Corporate Units.

Upon written notice to the Collateral Agent by the Purchase Contract Agent that a Holder of an Equity Unit has elected to effect Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement of its entire obligation under the Purchase Contract forming a part of such Equity Unit in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and the Purchase Contract Agreement, and that the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount or Fundamental Change Early Settlement Amount, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase
 
 
15
 
Contract and the Purchase Contract Agreement and that all conditions to such Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement, as the case may be, have been satisfied, then the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (a) the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (b) Pledged Treasury Securities in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case that had been components of such Equity Unit, and shall transfer such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, free and clear of the Pledge created hereby, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of such Holder.
 
(a)
 
In the event a Holder of Corporate Units, unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent in the manner provided for in or has not made an Early Settlement or a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying its Corporate Units, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures pursuant to the Remarketing as described in in order to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contract.  The Collateral Agent shall by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the sixth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, without any instruction from such Holder of Corporate Units, present the related Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing.  Upon receiving such Debentures, the Remarketing Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to remarket such Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures on such date at a price equal to or greater than 100% of the aggregate Value of such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures plus the applicable Remarketing Fee.  The Remarketing Agent may deduct the Remarketing Fee from any portion of the proceeds from the Remarketing of the Debentures that is in excess of the sum of 100% of the aggregate Value of such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the aggregate Separate Debentures Purchase Price.  Upon a Successful Remarketing and after deducting the Remarketing Fee from such Proceeds, the Remarketing Agent will remit the remaining portion of the Proceeds of a Successful Remarketing related to such Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures to the Collateral Agent.  On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall apply that portion of the Proceeds from such Remarketing equal to the aggregate Value of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures to satisfy in full the obligations of such Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Purchase Price for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts.  The remaining portion of such Proceeds, if any, shall be distributed by the Collateral Agent to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders.  If the Remarketing Agent advises the Collateral Agent in writing that it cannot remarket the related Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures of such Holders of Corporate Units at a price not less than 100% of the aggregate Value of such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, or if the Remarketing does not occur because a condition precedent to such Remarketing has not
Section 5.4(a)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement
Section 5.4(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement
 
 
16
 
been fulfilled, thus resulting in a Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent will, for the benefit of the Company, at the written direction of the Company, retain or dispose of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures in accordance with applicable law and satisfy in full, from any such disposition or retention, such Holders obligation to pay the Purchase Price for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts.
 
(b)
 
In the event a Holder of Treasury Units or, if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of Corporate Units, Corporate Units, has not made an Early Settlement or a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying its Treasury Units or Corporate Units, as the case may be, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or the related Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.  On the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the Purchase Contract Agent, invest the cash Proceeds of the maturing Pledged Treasury Securities or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in Permitted Investments.  Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder of Treasury Units or Corporate Units, the Collateral Agent shall apply the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio to the settlement of the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.  In the event the sum of the Proceeds from the related Pledged Treasury Securities or related Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and the investment earnings from the investment in Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall distribute such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of the Purchase Contract(s) or deliver any certificate therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder.
 
(c)
 
Pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of the applicable Three-Day Remarketing Period, but no earlier than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding such first Remarketing Date of the applicable Three-Day Remarketing Period, holders of Separate Debentures may elect to have their Separate Debentures remarketed by delivering the Separate Debentures, together with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of hereto, to the Custodial Agent.  The Custodial Agent will hold the Separate Debentures in an account separate from the Collateral Account.  A holder of Separate Debentures electing to have its Separate Debentures remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of hereto, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of the relevant Three-Day Remarketing Period, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Debentures to such holder.  After such time, such election to remarket shall become an irrevocable election to have such Separate Debentures remarketed in such
Exhibit C
Exhibit D
 
 
17
 
Remarketing.  Promptly after 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of the relevant Three-Day Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Debentures to be remarketed and shall deliver to the Remarketing Agent for Remarketing all Separate Debentures delivered to the Custodial Agent, and not withdrawn, pursuant to this Section 4.6(c) prior to such date.  The portion of the proceeds from such remarketing equal to the aggregate Value of the Separate Debentures will automatically be remitted by the Remarketing Agent to the Custodial Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Separate Debentures.
 
(d)
 
In addition, after deducting the Remarketing Fee from the Value of the remarketed Separate Debentures, from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the aggregate Value of the remarketed Separate Debentures, the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the remaining portion of the proceeds, if any, for the benefit of such holders.  If, despite using its commercially reasonable efforts, a remarketing attempt is unsuccessful on the first Remarketing Date of a Three-Day Remarketing Period, subsequent remarketings will be attempted on each of the two following Remarketing Dates in that Three-Day Remarketing Period until a Successful Remarketing occurs.  If the Remarketing Agent advises the Custodial Agent in writing that none of the three remarketings occurring during a Three-Day Remarketing Period resulted in a Successful Remarketing or, if a condition to the Remarketing shall not have been fulfilled, thus in either case resulting in a Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return the Separate Debentures to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to such holders.

The Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement; provided, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or, as the case may be, shall not refrain from exercising such right if, in the judgment of the Company evidenced in writing and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures; and provided, further, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five days prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right.

In addition to the rights and remedies specified in hereof or otherwise available at law or in equity, after a default hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor thereto) as in effect in the State of New York from time to time (the ) (whether or not the UCC is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted.

(c)
 
upon the Transfer of the Collateral to the Collateral Account or physical delivery of the Debentures to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing operation or any Intermediary or other entity not within the control of the Holder involved in the Transfer of the Collateral, including the Collateral Agent, gives the notices and takes the action required of it hereunder and under applicable law for perfection of that interest and assuming the establishment and exercise of control pursuant to ); and
Section 2.2 hereof
 
(d)
 
the execution and performance by the Holder of its obligations under this Agreement will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the Collateral other than the security interest and lien granted under hereof or violate any provision of any existing law or regulation applicable to it or of any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets.

The Holders from time to time, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any covenant made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby covenant to the Collateral Agent that for so long as the Collateral remains subject to the Pledge:
 
(a)
 
neither the Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holders will create or purport to create or allow to subsist any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge or any other security interest whatsoever over the Collateral or any part of it other than pursuant to this Agreement; and

In no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary be liable for any amount in excess of the Value of the Collateral.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary, each in its individual capacity, hereby waive any right of setoff, bankers lien, liens or perfection rights as Securities Intermediary or any counterclaim with respect to any of the Collateral.
 
 
The Company shall have the right, by one or more instruments in writing executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for the realization of any right or remedy available to the Collateral Agent, or of exercising any power conferred on the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, or to direct the taking or refraining from taking of any action authorized by this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) such direction shall not conflict with the provisions of any law or of this Agreement and (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be adequately indemnified as provided herein.

The Company shall promptly confirm in writing any oral instructions furnished to the Collateral Agent by the Company.
 
 
Each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely upon any certification, order, judgment, opinion, notice or other communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone, telecopy or facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein), and upon advice and statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may (without having to account therefor to the Company) accept deposits from, lend money to, make their investments in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Purchase Contract Agent and any Holder of Equity Units (and any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) as if it were not acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Purchase Contract Agent and any Holder of Equity Units without having to account for the same to the Company; provided that each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent covenants and agrees with the Company that it shall not accept, receive or permit there to be created in favor of itself and shall take no affirmative action to permit there to be created in favor of any other Person, any security interest, lien or other encumbrance of any kind in or upon the Collateral.
 
 
None of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Equity Units of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Equity Units or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Equity Units.  The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide the Company with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Equity Units (or any of their respective affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective affiliates.
 
 
The Company agrees:
 
(a)
 
to pay each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, for all services rendered by each of them hereunder; and
 
(b)
 
to indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and each of their respective directors, officers, agents and employees for, and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any loss, all claims (whether asserted by the Company, a Holder or any other Person) and liabilities and reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its powers and duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of such powers and duties.
 
 
25
 
The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each promptly notify the Company of any third party claim which may give rise to indemnity hereunder and give the Company the opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and no such claim shall be settled without the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
Without prejudice to its rights hereunder, when any of the Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary incurs expenses after a Termination Event occurs, or renders services after a Termination Event occurs, such expenses and compensation are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.
 
 
In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property deposited hereunder, the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent shall be entitled, after prompt notice to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, at its sole option, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and neither the Collateral Agent nor the Custodial Agent shall be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions.  The Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent shall be entitled to refuse to act until either (i) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing, satisfactory to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be, or (ii) the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be, shall have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be, sufficient to save the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be, harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be, may without negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith on its part incur by reason of its acting.  The Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent may in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be, may deem necessary.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Collateral Agent nor the Custodial Agent shall be required to take any action that is in its opinion contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability.
 
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent as provided below, (a) the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Equity Units, (b) the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent may be removed at any time by the Company and (c) if the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a
 
 
26
 
period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent.  The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be.  If no successor Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agents or Custodial Agents giving of notice of resignation or such removal, then the retiring Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be.  Each of the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent shall be a bank which has an office in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be, hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as the case may be, shall take all appropriate action to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor.  The retiring Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent hereunder.  After any retiring Collateral Agents or Custodial Agents resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent.  Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary.
 
 
The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith.  The appointment of agents pursuant to this Section 8.9 shall be subject to prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
 
The provisions of this Article VIII and Section 10.7 shall survive termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary.
 
 
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall any of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement to any third party for indirect, special, punitive, or
 
 
27
 
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them, incurred without any act or deed that is found to be attributable to negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary.
 
 
 
 
Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, at any time and from time to time, may amend this Agreement, in form satisfactory to the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, for any of the following purposes:

(c)
 
to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, Securities Intermediary or Purchase Contract Agent; or

It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly or semi-annual period for which interest is computed shall be computed on the basis of the number of days in such period using 30-day calendar months.  In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date.

The Company may select a Three-Day Remarketing Period during the Period for Early Remarketing by designating each of the three sequential Remarketing Dates to comprise such Three-Day Remarketing Period, provided that no Remarketing Date during the Period for Early Remarketing shall occur earlier than the third Business Day prior to December 1, 2011 nor later than the ninth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.
 
The Company will announce any Remarketing on the sixth Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of a Three-Day Remarketing Period and, for the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period, the Company will announce the remarketing of the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series on the third Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period.  Each such announcement (each a ) on each such date (each, a ).  The Remarketing Announcement shall specify the following:
Remarketing Announcement
Remarketing Announcement Date
 
(i)        (A)           if the Remarketing Announcement relates to a Remarketing to occur during the Period for Early Remarketing, that the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series may be remarketed on any and all of the sixth, seventh and eighth Business Days following such Remarketing Announcement Date;
 
(B)           if the Remarketing Announcement relates to a Remarketing to occur during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period, that the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series may be remarketed on any and all of the third, fourth and fifth Business Days following such Remarketing Announcement Date;
 
(ii)       (A)           if the Remarketing Announcement relates to a Remarketing to occur during the Period for Early Remarketing, that the Reset Effective Date will be the third Business Day following the Remarketing Date on which the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series are successfully remarketed, unless the Remarketing is successful within five business days of the next succeeding Interest Payment Date in which case such Interest Payment Date will be the Reset Effective Date; or
 
(B)           if the Remarketing Announcement relates to a Remarketing to occur during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period, that the Reset Effective Date will be June 1, 2012 if there is a Successful Remarketing;
 
(iii)       that the Reset Rate and Subsequent Interest Payment Dates for the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series will be established on the Successful Remarketing Date and effective on and after the Reset Effective Date;
 
(iv)       (A)           if the Remarketing Announcement relates to a Remarketing to occur during the Period for Early Remarketing, that the Reset Rate will equal the interest rate on the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series that will enable the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series to be remarketed at a price equal to 100% of the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series Purchase Price plus the applicable Remarketing Fee (the ); or
Remarketing Price
 
(B)           if the Remarketing Announcement relates to a Remarketing to occur during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period, that the Reset Rate will equal the interest rate on the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series that will enable the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series included
 
 
 
 
in the Remarketing to be remarketed at a price equal to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, plus the applicable Remarketing Fee on the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series being remarketed (the ); and
Contract Settlement Price
 
(v)       the possible ranges of the Remarketing Fee.
 
On the Business Day immediately following the Remarketing Announcement Date, the Company will issue a press release through any appropriate news agency, including Dow Jones & Company, Inc. and Bloomberg Business News, containing the Remarketing Announcement and publish such Remarketing Announcement on the Companys website or through another public medium as the Company may use at the time.
 
Each Holder of Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series may elect to have some or all of Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing.  A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement, Pledge Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series to the Custodial Agent on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day, but no earlier than the fifth Business Day, immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of any Three-Day Remarketing Period.  Any such notice and delivery may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing.  Any such notice and delivery may be withdrawn on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of the applicable Three-Day Remarketing Period in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Pledge Agreement.  Any such notice and delivery not withdrawn by such time will be irrevocable with respect to such Remarketing.  Promptly after 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first Remarketing Date of the applicable Three-Day Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent, based on the notices and deliveries received by it prior to such time, shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the principal amount of Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series to be tendered for Remarketing and shall cause such Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series to be presented to the Remarketing Agent.  Debentures of the Fifteenth Series that are components of Corporate Units will be deemed tendered for Remarketing and will be remarketed in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement.
 
Unless and until there has been a Successful Remarketing, on each Remarketing Date during a Three-Day Remarketing Period, the Company shall cause the Remarketing Agent to use its commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series that the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent shall have notified the Remarketing Agent have been tendered for, or otherwise are to be included in, the Remarketing, at a price per $1,000 principal amount of the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series such that the aggregate price for the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series being remarketed on that date will be approximately (i) if the Reset Effective Date is not the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Remarketing Price or (ii) if the Reset Effective Date is the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Contract Settlement Price.
 
In the event of a Successful Remarketing, on the Remarketing Date the Company will request the Depositary to notify its participants holding the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series, no later than the Business Day next succeeding the Successful Remarketing Date, of the Reset Rate, the Subsequent Interest Payment Dates and related Regular Record Dates for the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series.  If a Successful Remarketing does not occur during a Three-Day Remarketing Period, the Company will cause a notice of such unsuccessful Remarketing attempt to be
 
 
 
 
published on the Business Day following the last of the three Remarketing Dates comprising the Three-Day Remarketing Period (which notice, in the event of an unsuccessful Remarketing on the Final Remarketing Date, shall be published not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, and shall include the procedures that must be followed if a Holder of Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series wishes to exercise its right to put such Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series to the Company), in each case, by making a timely release to any appropriate news agency, including Bloomberg Business News and the Dow Jones News Service.
 
In accordance with the Depositarys normal procedures, on the Reset Effective Date, the transactions described above with respect to each Debenture of the Fifteenth Series tendered for purchase and sold in such Remarketing shall be executed through the Depositary, and the accounts of the respective Depositary participants shall be debited and credited and such Debentures of the Fifteenth Series delivered by book entry as necessary to effect purchases and sales of such Debentures of the Fifteenth Series.  The Depositary shall make payment in accordance with its normal procedures.
 
In no event shall the aggregate price for the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series in a Remarketing be less than a price (the ) equal to (i) in the case of a Remarketing during the Period for Early Remarketing, 100% of the sum of the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series Purchase Price or (ii) in the case of a Remarketing during the Final Three-Day Remarketing Period, 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series being remarketed.  A remarketing attempt on any Remarketing Date will be deemed unsuccessful if the (i) Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series for an aggregate price that is at least equal to the Minimum Price; or (ii) if a condition precedent to such Remarketing is not fulfilled.
Minimum Price
 
The right of each Holder of Debentures of the Fifteenth Series that are included in Corporate Units to have such Debentures of the Fifteenth Series, and each Holder of Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series to have any Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series (together, the ) remarketed and sold on any Remarketing Date shall be limited to the extent that (i) the Remarketing Agent conducts a Remarketing pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) a Special Event Redemption or Mandatory Redemption has not occurred prior to such Remarketing Date, (iii) the Remarketing Agent is able to find a purchaser or purchasers for Remarketed Debentures of the Fifteenth Series at the Minimum Price, and (iv) the purchaser or purchasers deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent as and when required.

In the event of a Failed Remarketing or if no Debentures of the Fifteenth Series are included in Corporate Units and none of the Holders of the Separate Debentures of the Fifteenth Series elect to have their Debentures of the Fifteenth Series remarketed in any Remarketing, the Interest Rate on the Debentures of the Fifteenth Series will not be reset and will continue to be the Interest Rate.
 
In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Interest Rate shall be reset at the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement.  The Reset Rate shall be effective from and after the Reset Effective Date.

Special Event Treasury Portfolio

As counsel to FPL Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (FPL Group), and FPL Group Capital Inc, a Florida corporation (FPL Group Capital), in connection with the issuance and sale by FPL Group of its new securities (the Securities) consisting of an aggregate of 7,000,000 equity units of FPL Group (Equity Units), initially consisting of an aggregate of 7,000,000 of FPL Groups corporate units (Corporate Units), with each Corporate Unit consisting of a contract to purchase shares (the Purchase Contracts) of FPL Groups common stock, $.01 par value (Common Stock), and, initially, a 1/20 or 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of FPL Group Capitals Series C Debenture due June 1, 2014 (Debentures), which Debentures are absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by FPL Group.
 
 We have participated in the preparation of or reviewed (1) Registration Statement Nos. 333-137120, 333-137120-01, 333-137120-02, 333-137120-03, 333-137120-04, 333-137120-05, 333-137120-06, 333-137120-07 and 333-137120-08, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto (the Registration Statement), which registration statement, as amended, was filed jointly by FPL Group, FPL Group Capital, Florida Power & Light Company, FPL Group Capital Trust II, FPL Group Capital Trust III, FPL Group Trust I, FPL Group Trust II, Florida Power & Light Company Trust I and Florida Power & Light Company Trust II with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); (2) the Base Prospectus dated May 3, 2007 forming a part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated May 20, 2009 (Prospectus Supplement) relating to the Securities, both such Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement having been filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act; (3) the Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities), dated as of June 1, 1999 (the Indenture), from FPL Group Capital to The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the Trustee); (4) the Guarantee Agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999 (the Guarantee Agreement), from FPL Group to The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Guarantee Trustee, pursuant to which the Debentures are absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed (the Guarantee) by FPL Group; (5) the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2009 (the Purchase Contract Agreement), between FPL Group and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Purchase Contract Agent (the Purchase Contract Agent); (6) the Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2009 (the Pledge Agreement), among FPL Group, the Purchase Contract Agent and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary; (7) the corporate proceedings of FPL Group with respect to the Registration Statement, the Guarantee, the Guarantee Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement; (8) the corporate proceedings of FPL Group Capital with respect to the Registration Statement, the Indenture and the Debentures; and (9) such other corporate records, certificates and other documents (including a receipt executed on behalf of FPL Group acknowledging receipt of the purchase price for the Corporate Units net of underwriting discounts, and an executed receipt on behalf of FPL Group Capital acknowledging receipt of the purchase price for the Debentures) and such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
 
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Debentures and the Guarantee, as it relates to the Debentures, are legally issued, valid, and binding obligations of FPL Group Capital and FPL Group, respectively, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity.
 
2.

3.           The Purchase Contracts are valid and binding obligations of FPL Group, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity.
 
4.           The Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Purchase Contracts, when issued and delivered by FPL Group against payment therefor in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts and the Pledge Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by FPL Group on or about May 26, 2009, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  In giving the foregoing consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
