FPL Group announces 2009 second quarter earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  FPL Group, Inc. (NYSE: FPL) today reported 2009 second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $370 million, or $0.91 per share, compared with $209 million, or $0.52 per share, in the second quarter of 2008. Compared to the prior-year quarter, NextEra Energy Resources net income increased by $183 million while Florida Power & Lights decreased by $4 million.
On an adjusted basis, FPL Groups earnings were $401 million, or $0.99 per share, compared with $375 million, or $0.93 per share, in the second quarter of 2008. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to NextEra Energy Resources.
FPL Groups management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. FPL Group management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of FPL Groups fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Our earnings for the quarter were solid overall, with lower year-over-year earnings at Florida Power & Light Company more than offset by the performance of NextEra Energy Resources. While the Florida economy is quite challenging, we are delivering exceptional value to FPL customers in the form of reliable, clean energy at low rates and are continuing to invest to support the needs of our customers in the years ahead. At NextEra Energy Resources, were investing to support the long-term growth of our renewables business, which continues to perform well and which we believe continues to have good growth prospects, said FPL Group Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
 
 
Florida Power & Light
Company
FPL Group's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported second quarter net income of $213 million, or $0.52 per share, down from $217 million, or $0.54 per share, in the prior years quarter.
Floridas economy continued to have a negative impact on FPLs results. Retail sales declined for the quarter by 2.8 percent on a year-over-year basis, and usage per retail customer declined by 2.5 percent. The average number of customers for the quarter was down by 16,000 on a year-over-year basis. Weather-related usage was above normal in the quarter but was the same amount as in last years comparable quarter.
While managing near-term economic challenges, the company also took actions designed to provide customers with affordable, reliable and clean energy in the future. During the quarter, FPL filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission for the construction of a new underground natural gas pipeline in Florida to meet increasing demand for natural gas as a clean fuel for generating electricity while helping to diversify and secure the states access to natural gas supplies. The pipeline, approximately 300 miles long, is proposed for construction in the eastern portion of the state from Palm Beach County in the south to Bradford County in the north. The Public Service Commission is expected to vote on the pipeline proposal in September.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy subsidiary of FPL Group with generating facilities in 25 states and Canada, reported second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $186 million, or $0.46 per share, compared with $3 million, or $0.01 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $217 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with $169 million, or $0.42 per share, in the second quarter of 2008.
NextEra Energy Resources second quarter adjusted earnings per share rose by 29 percent over the prior-year quarter despite a much lower than normal wind resource. These results were driven by the addition of new assets, the wholesale marketing and trading business, and the retail business. The companys wind assets increased by roughly 1,370 megawatts compared to the prior-year quarter, accounting for adjusted earnings per share of $0.05, with an additional $0.04 attributable to the ability to take the value of federal tax credits in the form of cash grants on 685 megawatts of wind projects in 2009. Earnings from the companys existing wind assets were negatively affected by a lower wind resource compared to last years second quarter, reducing earnings by $0.07 per share. In addition, a lower than expected wind resource associated with our new wind investments negatively affected earnings by $0.02 per share this quarter. The wholesale marketing and trading business added $0.09 in adjusted earnings per share when compared to the prior years quarter.
Results from operations in the Northeast benefited from the lack of a refueling outage at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station and higher-priced hedges and were up $0.08 per share over the prior-year quarter, while results from the companys Texas gas-fired facilities were adversely affected by lower power prices and were down $0.08 per share.

Corporate and Other
The loss in Corporate and Other increased to $29 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $11 million in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of consolidating tax adjustments and higher interest expense.
Outlook
FPL Group is affirming its adjusted earnings expectations of $4.20 to $4.40 per share for 2009 and $4.65 to $5.05 per share for 2010. However, for 2009, in light of a continued weak economy and the poor wind resource experienced in the second quarter, management currently feels more comfortable with the lower half of the adjusted earnings per share range. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a full list of the risk factors that may affect future earnings.
As always, FPL Groups adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions, no further decline in the national or Florida economy, and a reasonable capital markets atmosphere, and exclude the effect of adopting new accounting standards, if any, the mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and OTTI, none of which can be determined at this time.

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), FPL Group, Inc. (FPL Group) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL in this press release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or performance, climate change strategy or growth strategies (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL. 
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and FPL Group and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on FPL Group's and FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause FPL Group's and FPL's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements:
FPL Group and FPL are subject to complex laws and regulations and to changes in laws and regulations as well as changing governmental policies and regulatory actions.  FPL holds franchise agreements with local municipalities and counties, and must renegotiate expiring agreements.  These factors may have a negative impact on the business and results of operations of FPL Group and FPL.

The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear units owned by FPL or NextEra Energy Resources, and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission facilities involve substantial risks.  Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful or delayed, the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL could be adversely affected.

The use of derivative contracts by FPL Group and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that adversely impact the results of operations or cash flows of FPL Group and FPL.
FPL Group's competitive energy business is subject to risks, many of which are beyond the control of FPL Group, including, but not limited to, the efficient development and operation of generating assets, the successful and timely completion of project restructuring activities, the price and supply of fuel and equipment, transmission constraints, competition from other generators, including those using new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and demand for power, that may reduce the revenues and adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group.
FPL Group's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.

FPL Group and FPL participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth, future income and expenditures.
Customer growth and customer usage in FPL's service area affect FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations.
Weather affects FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations, as can the impact of severe weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, and can affect the production of electricity at power generating facilities.
Adverse capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and increase the cost of capital.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL, as well as exert downward pressure on the market price of FPL Group's common stock.
FPL Groups, FPL Group Capitals and FPLs inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect FPL Groups and FPLs liquidity, limit the ability of FPL Group and FPL to grow their businesses, and would likely increase interest costs.

FPL Group and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from third parties under supply and service contracts.
 
FPL Group and FPL are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as regulatory compliance and changes in or additions to applicable tax laws, rates or policies, rates of inflation, accounting standards, securities laws, corporate governance requirements and labor and employment laws.
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt FPL Group's and FPL's business may impact the operations of FPL Group and FPL in unpredictable ways.
The ability of FPL Group and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The risks described herein are not the only risks facing FPL Group and FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties also may materially adversely affect FPL Group's or FPL's business, financial condition and/or future operating results.
