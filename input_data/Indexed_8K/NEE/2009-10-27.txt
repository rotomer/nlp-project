FPL Group announces 2009 third quarter earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  FPL Group, Inc. (NYSE: FPL) today reported 2009 third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $533 million, or $1.31 per share, compared with $774 million, or $1.92 per share, in the third quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, FPL Groups earnings per share were $562 million, or $1.38 per share, compared with $506 million, or $1.25 per share, in the third quarter of 2008. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to NextEra Energy Resources.
FPL Groups management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. FPL Group management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of FPL Groups fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Despite challenges at FPL and in the Florida economy, FPL Group had another solid quarter. Our basic earnings story has remained fairly constant over the past two years: NextEra Energy Resources continues to grow adjusted earnings and earnings per share, while Florida Power & Light remains challenged by the economic downturn in Florida, said FPL Group Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
 
 
Florida Power & Light
Company
FPL Group's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported third quarter net income of $306 million, or $0.75 per share, down from $314 million, or $0.78 per share, in the prior-year quarter.
Floridas economy continued to have a negative impact on FPLs results. The total number of customers continued to decline in the third quarter, although at a slower pace.
FPL had approximately 9,000 fewer customers on average during the third quarter of 2009 than it did during the third quarter of 2008. The number of inactive accounts rose by 4,000 since the end of the second quarter of 2009.
Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales were up by 0.4 percent on a quarter-over-quarter basis primarily as a result of warmer weather. Operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses rose by $36 million over the prior-year quarter. The largest contributor to the increase was clause-related O&M, which has no effect on earnings.
Today, FPL is putting into service the 25 megawatt DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, the largest solar photovoltaic power plant in the country. President Barack Obama is scheduled to attend the commissioning. The DeSoto plant will produce enough electricity to serve approximately 3,000 homes, or nearly 20 percent of DeSoto County. Along with solar energy plants that FPL is building in other parts of the state, the company expects to have 110 megawatts of installed solar capacity by late 2010.
The company also completed construction of West County Energy Center Unit 1 during the quarter, a 1,220 megawatt combined cycle natural gas unit in Palm Beach County.
FPLs rate proceeding before the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) remains ongoing.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy subsidiary of FPL Group with generating facilities in 25 states and Canada, reported third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $233 million, or $0.57 per share, compared with $483 million, or $1.20 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $262 million, or $0.64 per share, compared with $215 million, or $0.53 per share, in the third quarter of 2008.
NextEra Energy Resources third quarter adjusted earnings per share rose by 21 percent over the prior-year quarter. The principal driver was the companys investment in new wind energy projects. This includes the positive effects of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which allows the company to take the value of federal wind production tax credits in the form of cash grants. Other positive drivers were strong performance from retail operations and the wholesale marketing and trading business. These were offset by unfavorable market conditions for the companys fossil power plants in Texas. In addition, while the wind resource was above prior-year quarter, the wind resource across the fleet this quarter was well below normal.
NextEra Energy Resources continued to make progress on its wind development program during the quarter. The company has 985 megawatts of wind projects either completed or under construction and has agreed to acquire an additional 185 megawatts of existing wind projects. Including the pending acquisition, the company now expects to add 1,170 megawatts of wind power in 2009.

Going forward, we believe it is clear that the United States is moving inexorably toward a carbon-constrained world. As a result of the investments we are continuing to make in clean energy, we believe we are well positioned for a future where carbon carries a cost, said Lew Hay.
Corporate and Other
The loss in Corporate and Other was $6 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared with $23 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Outlook
Due to a number of factors, including continued disappointment with the contributions from its Texas gas generation assets and another quarter of wind resource below expectations, FPL Group is revising its 2009 adjusted earnings expectations from $4.20 to $4.40 per share for 2009 to $4.10 to $4.20 per share. In addition, in light of the challenging market environment for the companys Texas merchant assets and the continued uncertainty about economic conditions in Florida, FPL Group is revising adjusted earnings expectations for 2010 from a range of $4.65 to $5.05 per share to a range of $4.25 to $4.85 per share.
FPL Groups adjusted earnings exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, these expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; continued public policy support for renewable power project development; selective transmission expansion to support renewable power projects; continued wind supply chain expansion; continued expansion of NextEra Energy Resources non-wind activities; access to reasonable capital and credit markets; no acquisitions; and a constructive regulatory framework in Florida. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future earnings.
As previously announced, FPL Groups third quarter earnings conference call is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET on Tuesday, Oct. 27, 2009.

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), FPL Group, Inc. (FPL Group) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL in this press release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, adjusted earnings or other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or performance, climate change strategy or growth strategies (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL. 
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and FPL Group and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on FPL Group's and FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause FPL Group's and FPL's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements:
FPL Group and FPL are subject to complex laws and regulations and to changes in laws and regulations as well as changing governmental policies and regulatory actions.  FPL holds franchise agreements with local municipalities and counties, and must renegotiate expiring agreements.  These factors may have a negative impact on the business and results of operations of FPL Group and FPL.

The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear units owned by FPL or NextEra Energy Resources, and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission facilities involve substantial risks.  Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful or delayed, the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL could be adversely affected.
 
6
 
The use of derivative contracts by FPL Group and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that adversely impact the results of operations or cash flows of FPL Group and FPL.
FPL Group's competitive energy business is subject to risks, many of which are beyond the control of FPL Group, including, but not limited to, the efficient development and operation of generating assets, the successful and timely completion of project restructuring activities, the price and supply of fuel and equipment, transmission constraints, competition from other generators, including those using new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and demand for power, that may reduce the revenues and adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group.
 
7
 
FPL Group's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.
FPL Group and FPL participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth, future income and expenditures.
Customer growth and customer usage in FPL's service area affect FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations.
Weather affects FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations, as can the impact of severe weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, and can affect the production of electricity at power generating facilities.
Adverse capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and increase the cost of capital.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL, as well as exert downward pressure on the market price of FPL Group's common stock.
 
8
 
FPL Groups, FPL Group Capitals and FPLs inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect FPL Groups and FPLs liquidity, limit the ability of FPL Group and FPL to grow their businesses, and would likely increase interest costs.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from third parties under supply and service contracts.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as regulatory compliance and changes in or additions to applicable tax laws, rates or policies, rates of inflation, accounting standards, securities laws, corporate governance requirements and labor and employment laws.
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt FPL Group's and FPL's business may impact the operations of FPL Group and FPL in unpredictable ways.
The ability of FPL Group and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events.
 
9
 
FPL Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The risks described herein are not the only risks facing FPL Group and FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties also may materially adversely affect FPL Group's or FPL's business, financial condition and/or future operating results.
