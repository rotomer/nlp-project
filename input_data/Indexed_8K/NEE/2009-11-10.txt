We have participated in the preparation of or reviewed (1) Registration Statement Nos. 333-160987, 333-160987-01, 333-160987-02, 333-160987-03, 333-160987-04, 333-160987-05, 333-160987-06, 333-160987-07 and 333-160987-08 (Registration Statement No. 333-160987), which registration statement was filed jointly by FPL Group, FPL Group Capital, Florida Power & Light Company, FPL Group Capital Trust II, FPL Group Capital Trust III, FPL Group Trust I, FPL Group Trust II, Florida Power & Light Company Trust I and Florida Power & Light Company Trust II with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); (2) the prospectus dated August 3, 2009 forming a part of Registration Statement No. 333-160987, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated November 5, 2009 relating to the Debentures, both such prospectus and prospectus supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; (3) the Indenture; (4) the Guarantee Agreement; (5) the corporate proceedings of FPL Group with respect to Registration Statement No. 333-160987 and the Guarantee Agreement; (6) the corporate proceedings of FPL Group Capital with respect to Registration Statement No. 333-160987, the Indenture and the Debentures; and (7) such other corporate records, certificates and other documents (including a receipt executed on behalf of FPL Group Capital acknowledging receipt of the purchase price for the Debentures) and such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
 
 
 
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Debentures and the Guarantee, as it relates to the Debentures, are legally issued, valid, and binding obligations of FPL Group Capital and FPL Group, respectively, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity.
 
In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that the certificates representing the Debentures conform to specimens examined by us and that the Debentures have been duly authenticated, in accordance with the Indenture, by the Trustee under the Indenture and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by FPL Group on or about November 10, 2009, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  In giving the foregoing consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
