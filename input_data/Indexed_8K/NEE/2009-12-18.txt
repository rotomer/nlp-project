Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On December 14, 2009, Calhoun Power Company I, LLC (Calhoun I), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources), entered into a $130 million limited-recourse senior secured variable rate term loan agreement and, on December 15, 2009, borrowed $130 million under the agreement. NextEra Energy Resources is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc.  Interest on the loan will be based on the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate plus a specified margin, payable quarterly, and the principal will be partially amortizing on a semi-annual basis with a balloon payment at maturity in December 2019.  Immediately upon funding of the loan, Calhoun I entered into several interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate movements with respect to interest payments on the loan.  The proceeds of the loan will be used to reimburse NextEra Energy Resources, in part, for its capital contributions related to a 668 megawatt natural gas-fired power generation facility in Alabama.  The loan will be secured by liens on the natural gas-fired power generation facility's assets, and certain other assets of, and the ownership interest in, Calhoun I.  The loan agreement contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to the failure to make required payments or to observe other covenants in the term loan agreement and related documents, actions by Calhoun I or by other parties under specified agreements relating to the generating facility or the term loan agreement, the termination of certain of such specified agreements, and certain events in bankruptcy.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date:  December 18, 2009
