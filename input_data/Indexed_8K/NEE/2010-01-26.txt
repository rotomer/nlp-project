FPL Group reports 2009 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings
 
 
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  FPL Group, Inc. (NYSE: FPL) today reported 2009 fourth-quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $349 million, or $0.85 per share, compared with $408 million, or $1.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, FPL Groups earnings were $323 million, or $0.79 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with $361 million, or $0.90 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to NextEra Energy Resources.
For the full-year 2009, FPL Group reported net income on a GAAP basis of $1.62 billion, or $3.97 per share, compared with $1.64 billion, or $4.07 per share, in 2008. On an adjusted basis, FPL Groups 2009 earnings were $1.65 billion, or $4.05 per share, for the full year, compared with $1.55 billion, or $3.84 per share, in 2008.
FPL Groups management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. FPL Group management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of FPL Groups fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Despite some significant challenges, FPL Groups adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 5 percent in 2009. At NextEra Energy Resources, the addition of nearly 1,200 megawatts of wind generation assets led the way to adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 6 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. At Florida Power & Light, we continued to provide customers with the lowest typical monthly bill in the state and excellent reliability; financial performance was helped by favorable weather. Looking ahead, I remain convinced that FPL Groups commitment to being a clean energy leader is the right strategy at the right time and will serve our customers and investors well for many years to come, said FPL Group Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
Florida Power & Light
Company
Reflecting the favorable impact of weather, fourth-quarter 2009 net income for Florida Power & Light Company, FPL Group's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, was $186 million, or $0.45 per share, compared with $151 million, or $0.38 per share, in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, net income was $831 million, or $2.04 per share, compared with $789 million, or $1.96 per share, in 2008.
Retail sales of electricity increased 7.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the prior-year quarter due to unseasonably warm weather. For the full-year 2009, retail sales of electricity were flat compared to the prior year despite significantly favorable weather that, on its own, added 14 cents per share to earnings compared with 2008. FPLs average number of customer accounts for both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 were essentially unchanged compared with the prior-year periods.
In October, with President Barack Obama in attendance, Florida Power & Light commissioned the DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, the largest solar photovoltaic power plant in the United States. During the year, construction also began on FPLs Martin and Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Centers, which are slated to open this yearFPL will recover the cost of these investments, totaling 110 megawatts, under a Florida statute enacted to encourage renewable energy projects.
.
During 2009, FPL also completed construction of units 1 and 2 at the companys West County Energy Center, twin 1,220-megawatt natural gas combined-cycle generating units in Palm Beach County. In total, FPL invested approximately $1.2 billion in new generation in 2009. These investments will increase the efficiency of FPLs generation fleet, provide savings to customers through fuel-cost reductions over the life of the projects, and reduce emissions.
Overall, FPLs fossil fuel fleet reached a record level of efficiency in 2009. FPLs investments since 2002 in cleaner, more efficient technology avoided approximately 4.9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2009 while saving customers an estimated $440 million in fuel costs. Increased fuel efficiency will contribute to a reduction in customers bills in 2010.
During 2009, FPLs rate proposal was heard by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC). A partial decision on the companys proposal was issued by the PSC on Jan. 13, 2010. The PSC granted FPL a 10 percent regulatory midpoint return on equity, a 59 percent regulatory equity ratio, and an annualized $75 million base rate increase. FPL is continuing to assess what changes it will need to make as a result of the outcome of the rate case.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy subsidiary of FPL Group, reported fourth-quarter 2009 net income on a GAAP basis of $178 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with $265 million, or $0.66 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $152 million, or $0.37 per share, compared with $218 million, or $0.55 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
For the full-year 2009, NextEra Energy Resources reported net income on a GAAP basis of $849 million, or $2.08 per share, compared with $915 million, or $2.27 per share, in 2008. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $882 million, or $2.16 per share, compared with $821 million, or $2.04 per share, for the full-year 2008.
NextEra Energy Resources had a challenging quarter but a strong year overall. Its fourth-quarter 2009 performance was impacted by the extension of a planned outage at the Seabrook Station nuclear plant, a poor wind resource across its fleet of wind turbines, and unfavorable market conditions in the Texas region. The company believes that the El Nio weather pattern currently being experienced in North America explains some of the poor wind resource experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
For the full-year 2009, growth in adjusted earnings per share of approximately 6 percent was driven largely by new wind projects, including the effects of taking the convertible investment tax credit on wind projects totaling 815 megawatts, and favorable performance by NextEra Energy Resources energy marketing and trading business and its Texas retail energy business. This was partially offset by unfavorable market conditions in Texas and a poor wind resource.
 
 
In 2009, NextEra Energy Resources added approximately 1,170 megawatts of wind capacity in North America. NextEra Energy Resources 2009 wind program included 985 megawatts of newly built projects in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon, and the purchase from Babcock & Brown of 185 megawatts of operating wind projects in South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. In all, NextEra Energy Resources now owns 7,540 megawatts of wind capacity in 17 states and Canada, maintaining its position as North Americas wind energy leader. To date, NextEra Energy Resources has invested approximately $11 billion in its wind business.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other negatively impacted FPL Groups fourth-quarter 2009 net income by $0.03 per share, compared with a loss of $0.03 per share in the prior-year quarter. For the full-year 2009, Corporate and Other negatively impacted net income by $0.15 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share for the prior year. As in most recent years, the primary component was interest expense.
Outlook
For 2010, FPL Group currently expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.65. The company does not expect a rapid recovery of the Florida economy. It also expects continued moderate natural gas prices and to add another 1,000 megawatts to its U.S.-leading wind portfolio in 2010.
FPL Groups adjusted earnings exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, FPL Groups adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no acquisitions. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), FPL Group, Inc. (FPL Group) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL in this press release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, adjusted earnings or other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or performance, climate change strategy or growth strategies (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could cause FPL Group's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL. 
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and FPL Group and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on FPL Group's and FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause FPL Group's and FPL's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements:
FPL Group and FPL are subject to complex laws and regulations and to changes in laws and regulations as well as changing governmental policies and regulatory actions.  FPL holds franchise agreements with local municipalities and counties, and must renegotiate expiring agreements.  These factors may have a negative impact on the business and results of operations of FPL Group and FPL.
The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear units owned by FPL or NextEra Energy Resources, and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission facilities involve substantial risks.  Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful or delayed, the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL could be adversely affected.
The use of derivative contracts by FPL Group and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that adversely impact the results of operations or cash flows of FPL Group and FPL.
FPL Group's competitive energy business is subject to risks, many of which are beyond the control of FPL Group, including, but not limited to, the efficient development and operation of generating assets, the successful and timely completion of project restructuring activities, the price and supply of fuel and equipment, transmission constraints, competition from other generators, including those using new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and demand for power, that may reduce the revenues and adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group.
FPL Group's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.
FPL Group and FPL participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth, future income and expenditures.
Customer growth and customer usage in FPL's service area affect FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations.
Weather affects FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations, as can the impact of severe weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, and can affect the production of electricity at power generating facilities.
Adverse capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and increase the cost of capital.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL, as well as exert downward pressure on the market price of FPL Group's common stock.
FPL Groups, FPL Group Capitals and FPLs inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect FPL Groups and FPLs liquidity, limit the ability of FPL Group and FPL to grow their businesses, and would likely increase interest costs.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from third parties under supply and service contracts.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as regulatory compliance and changes in or additions to applicable tax laws, rates or policies, rates of inflation, accounting standards, securities laws, corporate governance requirements and labor and employment laws.
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt FPL Group's and FPL's business may impact the operations of FPL Group and FPL in unpredictable ways.
The ability of FPL Group and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events.
FPL Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.
The risks described herein are not the only risks facing FPL Group and FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties also may materially adversely affect FPL Group's or FPL's business, financial condition and/or future operating results.
