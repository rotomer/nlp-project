On May 4, 2010, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc., entered into a $500 million, three-year bank revolving credit agreement that expires in May 2013.  The credit agreement provides for the funding of loans and the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate total of $500 million, which are available for FPLs general corporate purposes, including to provide back-up liquidity for FPL's commercial paper program and to provide liquidity in the event of a loss to FPL's operating facilities, including transmission and distribution facilities.  In order for FPL to borrow or issue letters of credit under the terms of the credit agreement, FPL is required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio.  The credit agreement also contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
