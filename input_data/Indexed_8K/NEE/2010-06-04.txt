Interest on the loan is based on the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate plus a specified margin.  Principal and interest on the loan are payable quarterly and the loan matures no later than February 28, 2015.

The proceeds from the loan were used to reimburse, in part, capital contributions made by NextEra Energy Resources for the development and construction of the wind generation facilities.  The loan agreement contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to the failure to make required payments or to observe other covenants in the term loan agreement and related documents, actions by Peace Garden Wind Funding, Peace Garden Wind, or by other parties under specified agreements relating to the generating facilities or the term loan agreement, the termination of such specified agreements, and certain events in bankruptcy.
