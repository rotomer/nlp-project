Exhibit 99
NextEra Energy announces second quarter 2010 earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported second quarter 2010 net income on a GAAP basis of $417 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with $370 million, or $0.91 per share, in the second quarter of 2009. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys earnings were $457 million, or $1.11 per share, compared with $401 million, or $0.99 per share, in the second quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to NextEra Energy Resources.
NextEra Energys management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energys fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Were pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. While the second quarter was certainly helped by favorable weather, we continue to see positive earnings impacts from our continued investments in clean and efficient power generation at both of our operating companies. In fact, on a weather-normalized basis, we have achieved a 7 percent year-to-date increase in adjusted earnings per share over last years comparable period. We continue to have a strong pipeline of investment opportunities that we believe should benefit both customers and shareholders alike over the long term, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported second quarter net income of $265 million, or $0.64 per share, up from $213 million, or $0.52 per share, in the prior-year quarter.

Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3 percent, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage and an increase of about 24,000 customers compared to the same period a year ago. Usage growth due to weather helped the quarterly earnings comparison by approximately $0.05 per share and customer growth added another $0.01.
In addition to positive customer growth, FPL has seen continued improvement in the number of inactive and low-usage customers since the fourth quarter of 2009. During the second quarter, the number of inactive customers rose modestly as expected due to seasonality, but at a rate lower than typically experienced. In addition, low-usage customers as a percentage of total residential customers improved slightly during the quarter. 
Operationally, the company announced that it is moving forward with an approximately $2 billion investment to modernize its Cape Canaveral and Riviera power plants. FPL estimates the new units will save customers $850 million to $950 million over the life of the plants compared with keeping the existing facilities in the fleet. They will also improve air quality by reducing particulate emissions by an estimated 88 percent at these sites and improve the plants carbon dioxide emission rate by roughly 50 percent.
In addition, elected officials and community leaders joined NASA and FPL executives on April 8 to commission FPLs Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center. The 10-megawatt facility, which is located on NASA property at Kennedy Space Center, is producing enough clean, emissions-free power to serve approximately 1,100 homes. The facility is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 227,000 tons over the life of the project, which according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is equivalent to removing 1,800 cars from the road each year. It is also expected to save approximately 122,000 barrels of oil and 2.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas over its lifetime.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy with generating facilities in 26 states and Canada, reported second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $154 million, or $0.38 per share, compared with $163 million, or $0.40 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $195 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with $194 million, or $0.48 per share, in the second quarter of 2009.
NextEra Energy Resources second quarter results were driven mainly by the addition of new wind projects, improved performance of existing assets, and the sale of a power plant, largely offset by higher interest expenses.
The companys wind assets increased by nearly 1,460 megawatts compared to the end of the prior-year quarter, contributing $0.03 to adjusted earnings per share. Existing assets contributed $0.01 to adjusted earnings per share as a result of higher generation from the wind portfolio and higher-priced hedges for the output of the Seabrook nuclear station. At 96 percent relative to the long-term expected average, the wind resource in the second quarter improved significantly over the prior two sequential quarters and the 89 percent measured in last years second quarter, a result the company believes is primarily attributable to the weakening of the El Nio weather effect.
All other factors were a negative $0.04 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense, offset by a $0.01 gain on the sale of an asset. The other category includes interest expense, differential membership costs, income tax adjustments, general and administrative expenses, share dilution and rounding differences.

The company currently has approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010. 
Outlook
NextEra Energy continues to expect it will deliver adjusted earnings per share for 2010 in the range of $4.25 to $4.65. For 2011, the company believes that adjusted EPS will fall roughly in the same range. It also expects adjusted EPS will grow at an overall average rate of 5 percent to 7 percent through 2014 from a 2009 base.
NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no acquisitions. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
