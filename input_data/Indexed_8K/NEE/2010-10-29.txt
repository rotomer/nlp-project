Exhibit 99
NextEra Energy announces third quarter 2010 earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported third quarter 2010 net income on a GAAP basis of $720 million, or $1.74 per share, compared with $533 million, or $1.31 per share, in the third quarter of 2009. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys earnings were $602 million, or $1.45 per share, compared with $562 million, or $1.38 per share, in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities (Energy Resources).
NextEra Energys management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energys management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energys fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter of 2010, increasing adjusted earnings per share by more than 5 percent over the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we continued expansion of our wind energy fleet at Energy Resources and also received most of the approvals necessary to build a 250-megawatt solar facility in California, with the output to be sold under a long-term contract. At FPL, we believe the settlement agreement we reached with the intervenors in our rate case is in the best interest of all of the parties involved, especially the approximately 8.7 million Floridians we serve. If the settlement is approved, base rates would be frozen through the end of 2012 as specified in the agreement. It would also allow substantial cost recovery on West County Energy Center Un it 3, a state-of-the-art combined-cycle natural gas plant that will provide significant fuel savings and environmental benefits for customers, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.

Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported third quarter net income of $308 million, or $0.74 per share, compared to $306 million, or $0.75 per share, in the prior-year quarter.
Retail kilowatt-hour sales for the quarter grew by 3 percent, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage and an increase of about 27,000 customers compared to the same period a year ago. Another key driver was cost recovery on West County Energy Center Units 1 and 2, which added $0.09 per share, offset by $0.02 lower Allowance for Funds Used During Construction as a result of the units entering service and by a portion of the $0.02 per share increase in operations and maintenance (O&M). Higher base rate revenue added another $0.03 per share, and the reversal of previously recorded depreciation surplus amortization, consistent with the pending settlement agreement, resulted in additional depreciation expense of $0.15 per share.
On Aug. 20, 2010, the company and the primary intervenors in its rate case reached a settlement agreement in the companys rate proceeding. If approved by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC), the settlement agreement would resolve all outstanding issues related to FPLs recent rate proceeding. The key elements of the agreement, if approved, are as follows:
NextEra Energy Resources
Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy with generating facilities in 26 states and Canada, reported third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $386 million, or $0.93 per share, compared with $212 million, or $0.52 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Energy Resources earnings were $267 million, or $0.64 per share, compared with $241 million, or $0.59 per share, in the third quarter of 2009.
Energy Resources comparable third quarter results were driven mainly by the addition of new wind projects, improved performance of existing assets, and gains in the gas infrastructure business, partially offset by reduced earnings in its proprietary power and gas trading business, and by higher interest expense.

The companys wind assets increased by approximately 1,260 megawatts since the second quarter of 2009, contributing $0.05 to adjusted earnings per share. Existing assets also contributed $0.05 to adjusted earnings per share, largely driven by increased output from the wind portfolio. At 99 percent relative to the long-term expected average, the wind resource in the third quarter improved significantly over the 87 percent measured in last years third quarter. In its gas infrastructure business, the company determined it would not move forward on a small subset of future drilling opportunities and realized a $0.04 gain when it exited related hedges. The customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses had reduced adjusted earnings per share of $0.04.
All other factors, excluding the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, were a negative $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense. The other category includes interest expense, differential membership costs, impact of asset sales, income tax adjustments, general and administrative expenses, share dilution and rounding differences.
 
 
The company currently has approximately 680 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010 or the early part of 2011.
During the third quarter, the company also received approval from the California Public Utility Commission and the California Energy Commission for the 250-megawatt Genesis solar project. Genesis will be located in one of the best solar-resource regions in the United States and use proven solar-trough technology.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other results contributed $0.07 to adjusted earnings per share during the current quarter compared to $0.04 in the previously comparable quarter.  Current results primarily benefited from an adjustment related to previously deferred taxes.
Outlook
NextEra Energy expects to deliver adjusted earnings per share for 2010 in the lower half of the previously disclosed range of $4.25 to $4.65. For 2011, the company believes that adjusted earnings per share will fall in a range of $4.25 to $4.55. It also continues to expect that adjusted earnings per share will grow at an overall average rate of 5 percent to 7 percent through 2014 from a 2009 base.
NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; approval of the 2010 settlement agreement; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar dev elopment; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no acquisitions. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause NextEra Energy's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and FPL in this press release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, wil l likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could have a significant impact on NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and/or FPL.
 
 
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and NextEra Energy and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
 
 
The following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on NextEra Energy's and FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NextEra Energy's and FPL's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements:
 
 
4
 
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs results of operations may be adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their businesses.
 
 
 
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial performance could be negatively affected if FPL is unable to recover, in a timely manner, certain costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital from its customers through regulated rates and cost recovery clauses.
 
 
 
 
 
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings which have significant compliance costs and expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.
 
 
 
 
 
5

Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NextEra Energys and FPLs businesses may impact the operations of NextEra Energy and FPL in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect NextEra Energys and FPLs results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13
 
 
The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.
