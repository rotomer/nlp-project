Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On January 13, 2011, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) (the borrower) borrowed approximately Canadian $94 million (approximately US $95 million) under an existing three-year bank revolving credit agreement entered into in December 2010.  NextEra Energy Resources is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy).  The principal amount of all borrowings under the credit agreement must be repaid by the end of the revolving credit term.  Interest on this borrowing is based upon the applicable Canadian dollar bankers acceptance rate plus an associated acceptance fee, with payments being due at the end of rate periods which can range from one to six months, as selected by the borrower.  All borrowings un der the credit agreement are guaranteed by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (Capital Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, which payment obligations are in turn guaranteed by NextEra Energy.  The credit agreement contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to failure to make required payments, NextEra Energys ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding a stated ratio, and certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to, as well as other covenants applicable to, the borrower, Capital Holdings and NextEra Energy.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
