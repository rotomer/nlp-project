Exhibit 99
 
NextEra Energy reports 2010 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2010 fourth-quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $263 million, or $0.63 per share, compared with $349 million, or $0.85 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys earnings were $332 million, or $0.80 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $323 million, or $0.79 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities (Energy Resources).
For the full-year 2010, NextEra Energy reported net income on a GAAP basis of $1.96 billion, or $4.74 per share, compared with $1.62 billion, or $3.97 per share, in 2009. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys 2010 earnings were $1.78 billion, or $4.30 per share, for the full year, compared with $1.65 billion, or $4.05 per share, in 2009.
NextEra Energys management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energys fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 6 percent last year amidst one of the most challenging business environments weve ever encountered. At Florida Power & Light, the key earnings drivers were our investments to increase the efficiency and reliability of our electric system, which directly benefit our customers. These investments have helped keep FPLs typical monthly residential bill the lowest of all 55 utilities in the state of Florida. At Energy Resources, while depressed power prices held earnings essentially flat, we continued to grow our wind energy fleet and remained the No.1 wind owner in the United States and became the No. 4 wind
owner in Canada. In addition, we have signed contracts on more than $2 billion worth of solar projects where site work has already commenced. Going forward, our two main businesses provide us with an enviable portfolio of opportunities that we expect will deliver attractive returns at reasonable risk levels, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
 
 
 
Florida Power & Light Company
Fourth-quarter 2010 net income for FPL, NextEra Energy's principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, was $181 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with $186 million, or $0.45 per share, in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, net income was $945 million, or $2.29 per share, compared with $831 million, or $2.04 per share, in 2009.
The main drivers of FPLs full-year 2010 earnings were cost recovery on the companys investment in West County Energy Center Units 1 & 2, higher electricity usage due to weather, and an increase in the companys base rates. These were offset by higher expenses for operations and maintenance (O&M) and depreciation, as well as a reduction in the companys Allowance for Funds Used During Construction. Retail sales of electricity for full-year 2010 rose by 2.2 percent over the prior year, to 105.0 million megawatt hours from 102.8 million megawatt hours. During the fourth quarter of 2010, FPL had approximately 28,000 more customers than during the comparable period of 2009.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, FPLs earnings increased over the prior-year quarter primarily as a result of higher base rates and cost recovery for West County Units 1 & 2, nuclear uprates, and the companys solar projects. These were more than offset by lower usage due to weather and higher O&M expenses relative to the prior-year quarter. FPLs fourth-quarter 2010 retail sales of electricity declined by 3.5 percent from the previous comparable quarter, primarily as a result of weather.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Florida Public Service Commission approved a settlement agreement between FPL and the major intervenors in the companys rate proceeding. Among the elements of the agreement: Base rates will remain effectively frozen until the end of 2012; cost recovery for a new combined-cycle natural gas unit at FPLs West County Energy Center will be limited to the projected fuel savings for customers during the term of the agreement; the companys allowed regulatory return on equity will be 10 percent plus or minus 100 basis points; and the company can vary the amount of surplus depreciation amortized in any one year subject to certain caps, provided its retail regulatory return on equity remains within the allowed range.
Operationally, FPLs fossil fuel fleet set a new record for its fuel efficiency in 2010, bringing its systemwide heat rate down to 8,043 British thermal units (BTU) per kilowatt hour. The average heat rate for the industry was 10,060 BTUs per kilowatt hour for 2009, the most recent year for which data are available. Since 2001, FPLs heat rate has improved by 17 percent, resulting in more than $600 million in savings for customers in 2010 as a result of increased fuel efficiency. FPLs service reliability, as measured by the System Average Interruption Duration Index, was in the top quartile of utilities nationwide in 2010. FPLs O&M expenses for all of 2010 were 1.50 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with the latest available industry average of 2.21 cents per kilowatt hour.
In December, FPL brought online a 75-megawatt solar thermal array at its gas-fired plant in Martin County, Fla. Completed on time and under budget, the Martin Solar Energy Center is the worlds first hybrid power plant integrating solar thermal technology with an existing combined-
cycle natural gas unit. FPL now has a total of 110 megawatts of solar generation operating in Florida.

Energy Resources
Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported fourth-quarter 2010 net income on a GAAP basis of $73 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with $156 million, or $0.38 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Energy Resources earnings were $143 million, or $0.34 per share, compared with $130 million, or $0.32 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the full-year 2010, Energy Resources reported net income on a GAAP basis of $980 million, or $2.37 per share, compared with $759 million, or $1.86 per share, in 2009. On an adjusted basis, Energy Resources earnings were $800 million, or $1.93 per share, compared with $792 million, or $1.94 per share, for the full-year 2009.
The main drivers of Energy Resources full-year 2010 earnings were the addition of new wind projects, higher production from the companys nuclear plants and existing wind projects, and gains from the companys gas infrastructure business. These were offset by higher interest costs (primarily due to the growth of the business), lower earnings from the companys proprietary power and gas trading, and write-offs associated with the future repowering of two wind projects in California.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, Energy Resources earnings were driven primarily by higher production at the companys Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear plants and approximately 510,000 additional megawatt hours of generation from the companys existing wind fleet due to a stronger wind resource, compared with the prior-year quarter. These were offset by declining earnings from the companys customer supply businesses and proprietary power and gas trading, weak market conditions for the companys merchant gas-fired assets in Texas, and higher interest and general and administrative expenses. In addition, in the current quarter the company also took a charge of $0.03 of adjusted earnings per share as a result of writing off investments associated with the future repowering of two wind projects in California.
For all of 2010, Energy Resources added approximately 754 megawatts of wind capacity in North America in 2010, including 70 megawatts of acquisitions. At year end, the company owned 8,298 megawatts of wind generation. The company ended the year as the largest owner of wind generation in the United States and the fourth largest owner in Canada, with a total investment in wind of roughly $12.5 billion.
The company also made progress during 2010 in signing power purchase agreements for the output of its wind fleet. All told, the company entered into long-term contracts on approximately 1,238 megawatts of wind power during the year. Operationally, the companys fleet of power-generating facilities performed exceptionally well, with the lowest forced-outage rate on record.
On the solar front, the long-term power purchase agreement for the companys 250-megawatt Genesis project was approved by the California Public Utility Commission in 2010. The companys plan is for the projects twin 125-megawatt solar-thermal arrays to qualify for the convertible investment tax credit in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The companys solar project in Spain also made progress in 2010, with the Spanish government finalizing its revised feed-in tariff in December. Combined, the Genesis and Spain solar projects represent an investment exceeding $2 billion, and the company expects them to be significant earnings drivers starting in the 2013/2014 timeframe.

Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other added $0.03 per share to NextEra Energys fourth-quarter 2010 net income, compared with a contribution of $0.02 per share in the prior-year quarter. For the full-year 2010, Corporate and Other positively impacted net income by $0.08 per share, compared with a contribution of $0.07 per share for the prior year.
Outlook
For 2011, NextEra Energy currently expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.55. It also continues to expect that adjusted earnings per share will grow at an overall average rate of 5 percent to 7 percent through 2014 from a 2009 base.
NextEra Energys adjusted earnings exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no additional ac quisitions. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
