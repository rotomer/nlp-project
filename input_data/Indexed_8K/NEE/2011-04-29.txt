Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 29, 2011, NextEra Energy, Inc. issued a press release announcing first quarter 2011 earnings for NextEra Energy, Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On April 27, 2011, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (Capital Holdings) and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) (collectively, the Borrowers) entered into a 170 million principal amount (approximately US $250 million) variable rate revolving loan agreement (the Revolving Loan Agreement) to finance a portion of the costs associated with constructing two 49.9 megawatt (mw) thermal solar plants and related facilities in Spain (the Spain Solar Project).  Capital Holdings is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy), and the direct parent company of NextEra Energy Resources.  Borrowings under the Revolving Loan Agreement have a maturity date of April 2014 and interest is based on a Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus a specified margin, payable monthly or quarterly depending on the interest period.
In addition, on April 28, 2011, two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources (collectively, the Project Borrowers) entered into two senior secured limited-recourse variable rate loan agreements (collectively, Project Loan Agreements), one loan agreement to finance a further portion of the costs associated with constructing the Spain Solar Project (construction loan), and the second loan agreement to finance ongoing value added tax payments associated with the construction of the Spain Solar Project (VAT loan).
The construction loan agreement provides for approximately 589 million principal amount (approximately US $875 million) in borrowings with a maturity date of December 2030 and interest payable based on EURIBOR plus a specified margin.  Interest and principal on the construction loan is payable semi-annually beginning in June 2014.  Concurrent with executing the construction loan agreement, several interest rate swaps were entered into to hedge against interest rate movements with respect to a portion of the projected interest payments on the construction loan, with an interest rate cap to hedge the remaining portion of the projected interest payments.  Approximately 105 million (approximately US $155 million) of the funding commitment available under the construction loan agreement was borrowed on April 28, 2011, with the remainder anticipated to be borrowed on a monthly basis through the completion of construction of the Spain Solar Project.  The VAT loan agreement provides for 40 million (approximately US $60 million) in borrowings with a maturity date of no later than April 2015 and interest payable semi-annually based on EURIBOR plus a specified margin.  Approximately 8 million (approximately US $12 million) of the funding commitment available under the VAT loan agreement was borrowed on April 28, 2011.  The Project Loan Agreements are secured by security agreements and pledges covering certain of the Project Borrowers assets and a pledge of the ownership interest in the Project Borrowers.
As a precondition to borrowing under the terms of the Revolving Loan Agreement and the Project Loan Agreements, among other things, NextEra Energys ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio.  The Revolving Loan Agreement and the Project Loan Agreements contain default and related acceleration provisions for the failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain covenants (including, for the Revolving Loan Agreement, a requirement that NextEra Energy's ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed the specified ratio and, for the Project Loan Agreements, a requirement that the Project Borrowers must complete construction of the Spain Solar Project by a certain date), certain bankruptcy-related events, and other actions by the Borrowers, the Project Borrowers or other parties as specified in the loan agreements.
The debt payment obligations under the Revolving Loan Agreement and, until certain obligations or conditions related to the Spain Solar Project are met, under the Project Loan Agreements and any related interest rate hedges are guaranteed by NextEra Energy and Capital Holdings.  The Capital Holdings guarantee contains default and acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, NextEra Energy's ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding a specified ratio.  The US dollar amounts for the respective loans presented above are based on the conversion rate as of the date of closing.

Exhibit 99
 
NextEra Energy announces first quarter earnings for 2011
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2011 first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $268 million, or $0.64 per share, compared with $556 million, or $1.36 per share, in the first quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys earnings were $392 million, or $0.94 per share, compared with $386 million, or $0.94 per share, in the first quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities.
NextEra Energy management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining whether certain performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energys fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
NextEra Energy delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2011. At Florida Power & Light, net income was up more than 7 percent over the prior-year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Those investments have allowed FPL to provide its customers with 99.98 percent service reliability and to significantly improve the efficiency of its power generation fleet, saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs and providing low bills for residential and business customers alike. At NextEra Energy Resources, we signed power purchase agreements for an additional 400 megawatts of wind capacity. In addition, we are very encouraged that California adopted a robust renewable portfolio standard; we look forward to doing additional business in the state, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.

Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energys principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported first quarter net income of $205 million, or $0.49 per share, compared with $191 million, or $0.47 per share, for the prior-year quarter.
During the first quarter, FPL's earnings per share (EPS) increased $0.02 over the prior-year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) for West County Energy Center Unit 3, returns on clause-related investments including the Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center and extended power uprates to the companys existing nuclear units, and rate base growth, partially offset by share dilution. The companys customer count was up by approximately 30,000 compared to the prior-year quarter. FPLs customer base has now grown for five year-over-year comparable quarters in a row after previously declining for five quarters in a row.
During the quarter, FPL neared completion of West County Energy Center Unit 3, which will add 1,220 megawatts (MW) of generation in the state. In addition, site work is continuing on the $2.4 billion modernizations of the Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach facilities, which together will add 2,420 MW of generation when completed in 2013 and 2014, respectively. All three gas-fueled units are expected to reduce air emissions while providing fuel savings to customers.
In March, the company dedicated the Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center, the worlds first large-scale hybrid solar plant. The facility integrates a 75-MW solar thermal array with an existing combined-cycle natural gas unit. Over its life, the project is expected to save approximately 600,000 barrels of oil and 41 billion cubic feet of natural gas, diversifying Floridas energy supply.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy with generating facilities in 26 states and Canada, reported first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $65 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with $367 million, or $0.89 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $189 million, or $0.46 per share, compared with $196 million, or $0.47 per share, in the first quarter of 2010.
In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy Resources new assets were roughly flat compared to the year-ago quarter, with contributions from the addition of 754 MW of wind capacity during 2010 offset by lower convertible investment tax credit elections in the current-year quarter.
Existing assets added $0.10 of adjusted EPS from the year-ago period. The companys existing wind assets added $0.17 in adjusted EPS, due largely to higher production and benefits from state tax credits. The wind fleet produced roughly 960,000 additional megawatt hours of electricity, driven primarily by a stronger wind resource. In ISO New England, earnings declined $0.06 in adjusted EPS, primarily due to lower prices for the power output of the Seabrook nuclear station. In ERCOT, weaker market conditions negatively impacted earnings from the companys natural gas assets, which declined by $0.02 in adjusted EPS from a year ago.
During the quarter, NextEra Energy Resources completed a review of the estimated useful life of the newer wind turbines in the companys portfolio as of Jan. 1, 2011. Over time, the technology employed in NextEra Energy Resources turbines has improved, and based on its actual experience the company now believes that with proper maintenance its fleet will last longer than previously estimated. As a result, the company has extended the estimated useful life for its newer wind turbine fleet to 30 years. For the assets already in service, the after-tax impact of the change in assumption for the first quarter was roughly 2.5 cents in adjusted EPS. For full-year 2011, the impact is expected to be roughly 10.5 cents in adjusted EPS.
 
2
 
NextEra Energy Resources customer supply business and proprietary power and gas trading earnings declined by $0.07 in adjusted EPS during the quarter. The earnings comparison for the wholesale full requirements business was negatively impacted by customer migration and by the absence of a prior-year gain on a large wholesale contract sale.
Asset sales declined $0.03 in adjusted EPS during the quarter due to the absence of gains recorded in the prior years comparable quarter on the sale of the companys interest in a 27-MW waste-to-energy facility. All other factors contributed a negative $0.01 associated with higher interest expense due to higher borrowings and higher corporate general and administrative expenses, both from growth of the business.
So far in 2011, NextEra Energy Resources has signed power purchase agreements for the output of 400 MW of wind generation. Since the start of last year, the company has signed power purchase agreements for 1,638 MW of wind generation. NextEra Energy Resources expects to add 1,400-2,000 MW to its wind portfolio during 2011 and 2012 combined.
Shortly after the close of the first quarter 2011, NextEra Energy Resources secured lines of credit for the construction of two 49.9-MW solar thermal arrays in Extremadura, Spain. These solar energy projects are expected to commence production in 2013.
Outlook
NextEra Energy believes that as a result of the change in the assumption regarding the estimated useful life for a portion of the companys wind fleet, adjusted earnings per share for 2011 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65 from the previous range of $4.25 to $4.55, which is an increase of $0.10 as a result of the depreciation life change. The company expects that adjusted earnings per share will grow at an overall average rate of 5 percent to 7 percent through 2014 from a 2011 base.
NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no acquisitions or divestitures. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.

The business, financial results, financial condition and prospects of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond their control.  The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may adversely affect the business and may cause the actual results of NextEra Energy and FPL in future periods to differ substantially from those that NextEra Energy or FPL currently expects or seeks.  Many of the risks set forth below may only apply to a portion of the businesses of subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, such as its FPL business, its wind or solar generation development businesses, its transmission business or its gas infrastructure business.  Accordingly, references to NextEra Energy below in some instances refer to the applicable businesses or subsidiaries of NextEra Energy.  Risks specifically applicable to FPL generally include a reference to FPL.
.
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results may be adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their businesses
.
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results could be negatively affected if they or their rate-regulated businesses are unable to recover, in a timely manner, certain costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital from customers through regulated rates and, in the case of FPL, cost recovery clauses
 
5
 
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings which have significant compliance costs and expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.
NextEra Energy and FPL may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.
NextEra Energys and FPLs businesses are subject to risks associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase their cost of operations and may expose them to liabilities.
 
6
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs businesses could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of GHG emissions.
The construction, operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities involve risks that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear generation facilities owned by NextEra Energy or FPL and in increased costs and capital expenditures.
 
7
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs operating results could suffer if they do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, generation, transmission, distribution or other facilities on schedule or within budget.
 
8
 
The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL.
 
The occurrence of any of these effects or events could result in, among other matters, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines, replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet contractual obligations.  Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or increased expenses.  Breakdown or failure of an operating facility of NextEra Energy, for example, may prevent NextEra Energy from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in some situations, could result in termination of the agreement or subject NextEra Energy to liability for liquidated damages.  The operation and maintenance of NextEra Energys gas infrastructure and power transmission businesses also are subject to many of the foregoing risks or substantially similar risks.
NextEra Energys competitive energy business is subject to development and operating risks that could limit the revenue growth of this business and have other negative effects on NextEra Energys financial results.
 
9
 
NextEra Energys competitive energy business is dependent on continued public policy support and governmental support for renewable energy, particularly wind and solar projects.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, counterparties and vendors.
 
10
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results may continue to be negatively affected by slower customer growth and customer usage.
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results are subject to risks associated with weather conditions, such as the impact of severe weather.
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may negatively affect NextEra Energys and FPLs ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NextEra Energy and FPL and exert downward pressure on the market price of NextEra Energys common stock.
 
11
 
NextEra Energys, Capital Holdings and FPLs inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect NextEra Energys and FPLs liquidity, limit the ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to grow their businesses, and increase interest costs, while the liquidity of the companies also could be impaired by the inability of their credit providers to maintain their current credit ratings or to fund their credit commitments.
The use of derivative contracts by NextEra Energy and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that could adversely affect their financial results and liquidity.
 
12
 
NextEra Energy and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, some of which are traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets or on exchanges, to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and for NextEra Energy to engage in trading and marketing activities.  NextEra Energy could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these derivative instruments or if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments under these derivative instruments.  NextEra Energy also could suffer a reduction in operating cash flows as a result of the requirement to post margin cash collateral.  In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative instruments involves managements judgment or use of estimates.  Although NextEra Energy and FPL execute transactions in derivative instruments on either recognized exchanges or via the OTC markets, depending on the most favorable credit and market execution factors, there is greater volatility and less liquidity in transactions executed in OTC markets and, as a result, NextEra Energy and FPL may not be able to execute such transactions in times of market volatility.  As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments.  In addition, FPLs use of such instruments could be subject to prudence challenges and, if found imprudent, could result in disallowances of cost recovery for such use by the FPSC.
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if the rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) broaden the scope of its provisions regarding the regulation of OTC financial derivatives and make them applicable to NextEra Energy and FPL.
 
13
 
NextEra Energys ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.
NextEra Energy may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NextEra Energy or if NextEra Energy is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.
Changes in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could adversely affect NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results, financial condition and liquidity.
 
14
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to their reputation and/or the financial results of the retail business.

The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NextEra Energys and FPLs insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.
 
16
 
The businesses and financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL could be negatively affected by the lack of a qualified workforce, work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.
