This Supplemental Indenture has been executed in several counterparts, all of which constitute but one and the same instrument.  This Supplemental Indenture has been recorded in several counties and documentary stamp taxes as required by law in the amount of $875,000 and non-recurring intangible taxes as required by law in the amount of $48,492.77 were paid on the Supplemental Indenture recorded in the public records of Palm Beach County, Florida.
 
:  The new bonds (New Bonds) being issued in connection with this Supplemental Indenture are secured by real property and personal property located both within Florida and outside of Florida.  The aggregate fair market value of the collateral exceeds the aggregate principal amount of (y) the New Bonds plus (z) the other outstanding bonds secured by the mortgage supplemented hereby and all previous supplemental indentures thereto.  The intangible tax has been computed pursuant to Section 199.133 (2), Florida Statutes, by (i) determining the percentage of the aggregate fair market value of the collateral constituting real property situated in Florida and by multiplying that percentage times the principal amount of the New Bonds (the result hereinafter defined as the Tax Base) and (ii) multiplying the tax rate times the Tax Base.

One Hundred Fourteenth Series of Bonds
 
Section 1.
 
(I)  There shall be a series of bonds designated 5.125% Series due June 1, 2041, herein sometimes referred to as the , each of which shall also bear the descriptive title First Mortgage Bond, and the form thereof, which shall be established by Resolution of the Board of Directors of FPL, shall contain suitable provisions with respect to the matters hereinafter in this Section specified.  Bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series shall mature on June 1, 2041 and shall be issued as fully registered bonds in denominations of One Thousand Dollars and, at the option of FPL, in integral multiples of One Thousand Dollars (the exercise of such option to be evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof); they shall bear interest at the rate of 5.125% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year (each an ) commencing on December 1, 2011; the principal of and interest on each said bond to be payable at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.  Bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series shall be dated as in Section 10 of the Mortgage provided.  The record date for payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date shall be the close of business on (1) the business day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date so long as the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series are held by a securities depository in book-entry only form or (2) the 15th calendar day immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date if the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series are not held by a securities depository in book-entry only form.  Interest on the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series will accrue from and including June 10, 2011 to but excluding December 1, 2011 and, thereafter, from and including the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (and if no interest has been paid on the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series, from June 10, 2011) to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.  No interest will accrue on a bond of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series for the day on which such bond matures.  The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the number of days in the period using 30-day calendar months.
One Hundred Fourteenth Series
Interest Payment Date
 
(II)
 
Bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series shall be redeemable either at the option of FPL or pursuant to the requirements of the Mortgage (including, among other requirements, the application of cash delivered to or deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of Section 64 of the Mortgage or with proceeds of Released Property) in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to maturity, upon notice, as provided in Section 52 of the Mortgage, mailed at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the ) at the applicable price (the ) described below.  If FPL redeems all or any part of the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series at any time prior to December 1, 2040, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus a premium, if any (the ).  In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
Redemption Date
Redemption Price
Make-Whole Premium
 
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any bond of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
 
 
 
 
 
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.  Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 15 basis points.
 
The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by FPL; that if FPL fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., or if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee in consultation with, and at the expense of, FPL (in any such case, an ).
provided
Independent Investment Banker
 
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium,  means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the ).  The Independent Investment Banker will determine the Treasury Yield as of the third business day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
Treasury Yield
Remaining Term
 
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates or any successor release (the ).  If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield.  In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release).  Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation will be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward.  If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
H.15 Statistical Release
 
If FPL redeems all or any part of the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series at any time on or after December 1, 2040, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
(III)
 
At the option of the registered owner any bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series, upon surrender thereof for exchange at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, together with a written instrument of transfer wherever required by FPL, duly executed by the registered owner or by his duly authorized attorney, shall (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of bonds of the same series of other authorized denominations.
 
Bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series shall be transferable (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
 
Upon any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series, FPL may make a charge therefor sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge, as provided in Section 12 of the Mortgage, but FPL hereby waives any right to make a charge in addition thereto for any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Fourteenth Series.

If a record date is fixed, those persons who were holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such persons continue to be holders after such record date.  No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.

Securities of this series shall be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to the Stated Maturity, upon notice mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the ), at the applicable price (the ) described below.  If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series at any time prior to March 1, 2021, the Redemption Price will equal the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus (iii) a premium, if any (the ).  In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.

The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
 
 
 
 
 
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.  Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 25 basis points.
 
The Company will appoint an independent investment banking institution of national standing to calculate the Make-Whole Premium; that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least thirty (30) days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC or RBS Securities Inc. or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee in consultation with, and at the expense of, the Company (in any such case, an ).

Independent Investment Banker
 
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium,  means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the ).  The Independent Investment Banker will determine the Treasury Yield as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
Treasury Yield
Remaining Term
 
The Independent Investment Banker will determine the weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates or any successor release (the ).  If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield.  In all other cases, the Independent Investment Banker will calculate the Treasury Yield by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release).  The Independent Investment Banker will round any weekly average yields so calculated to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward.  If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Independent Investment Banker will select comparable rates and calculate the Treasury Yield by reference to those rates.
H.15 Statistical Release
 
If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series at any time on or after March 1, 2021, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
If at the time notice of redemption is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are received.
 
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Securities will be absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, by NextEra Energy, Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group, Inc.), as Guarantor (the ), pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999, between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) (as Guarantee Trustee) (the ).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
 
We have acted as counsel to Florida Power & Light Company, a Florida corporation (the Company) in connection with the authorization, issuance and sale by the Company of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its First Mortgage Bonds, 5.125% Series due June 1, 2041 (the Bonds), issued under the Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of January 1, 1944, as the same is supplemented by one hundred and seventeen indentures supplemental thereto, the latest of which is dated as of June 1, 2011 (such Mortgage as so supplemented being hereinafter called the Mortgage) from the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (Mortgage Trustee).
 
 
We have participated in the preparation of or reviewed (1) Registration Statement Nos. 333-160987, 333-160987-01, 333-160987-02, 333-160987-03, 333-160987-04, 333-160987-05, 333-160987-06, 333-160987-07 and 333-160987-08 (the Registration Statement), which Registration Statement was filed jointly by the Company, NextEra Energy, Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group, Inc.), NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group Capital Inc), FPL Group Capital Trust II, FPL Group Capital Trust III, FPL Group Trust I, FPL Group Trust II, Florida Power & Light Company Trust I and Florida Power & Light Company Trust II with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); (2) the prospectus dated August 3, 2009 (the Base Prospectus) forming a part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated June 6, 2011 (the Prospectus Supplement) relating to the Bonds, both such Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; (3) the Mortgage; (4) the corporate proceedings of the Company with respect to the Registration Statement and with respect to the authorization, issuance and sale of the Bonds; and (5) such other corporate records, certificates and other documents (including a receipt executed on behalf of the Company acknowledging receipt of the purchase price for the Bonds) and such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
 
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Bonds are legally issued, valid and binding obligations of the Company, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting mortgagees and other creditors rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity.
 
In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that the certificates representing the Bonds conform to specimens examined by us and that the Bonds have been duly authenticated, in accordance with the Mortgage, by the Mortgage Trustee under the Mortgage, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on or about June 10, 2011, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. In giving the foregoing consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
This opinion is limited to the laws of the States of New York and Florida and the federal laws of the United States insofar as they bear on the matters covered hereby.
