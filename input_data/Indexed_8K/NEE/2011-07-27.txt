Exhibit 99
 
NextEra Energy announces second quarter 2011 earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported second quarter 2011 net income on a GAAP basis of $580 million, or $1.38 per share, compared with $417 million, or $1.01 per share, in the second quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys earnings were $500 million, or $1.18 per share, compared with $457 million, or $1.11 per share, in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities (NextEra Energy Resources).
NextEra Energys management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energys fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the second quarter of 2011, increasing adjusted earnings per share by more than 6 percent over the prior-year comparable quarter. At Florida Power & Light Company, the key earnings drivers were the investments we made to increase the efficiency and reliability of our electric system, which directly benefit our residential and business customers through reduced fuel costs and lower bills. At NextEra Energy Resources, we continue to actively sign power purchase agreements for new wind projects as well as for our existing assets, which should add increased visibility to future earnings and cash flow. We believe our two primary operating companies continue to provide us with a strong pipeline of investment opportunities, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.

Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported second quarter net income of $301 million, or $0.72 per share, up from $265 million, or $0.64 per share, in the prior-year comparable quarter.
Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 2.8 percent, an improvement due primarily to weather and an increase of approximately 28,500 customers during the quarter as compared to the same period a year ago. FPLs customer base has now grown for six year-over-year comparable quarters in a row.
In May, FPL commissioned the third unit of the West County Energy Center on time and on budget. The unit adds approximately 1,220 megawatts (MW) to what is now the nations largest combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plant.
The company moved forward with its construction of the modernized $1.3 billion Riviera Beach Next Generation Clean Energy Center. Scheduled to open in 2014, the state-of-the-art power plant will use high-efficiency, combined-cycle natural gas technology to produce up to approximately 1,220 MW of electricity, or enough power for approximately 250,000 FPL customers.
 
Coupled with the modernization of the Cape Canaveral plant, FPL expects these two facilities will provide an estimated $850 million to $950 million in net savings to customers over the life of these projects, while reducing the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions per megawatt-hour by 98 percent and the rate of particulate emissions per megawatt-hour by 89 percent.
 
 
Earlier this month FPL took an initial step to seek state regulatory approval to modernize the Port Everglades facility. Like the Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach projects, FPL expects a modernized Port Everglades to provide considerable customer benefits. If it were to come online in 2016 as proposed, Port Everglades would use an estimated 35 percent less fuel per megawatt-hour and provide customers with more than $400 million in estimated net savings over the life of the plant.
 
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy with generating facilities in 26 states and Canada, reported second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $239 million, or $0.57 per share, compared with $154 million, or $0.38 per share, in the prior-year comparable quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $159 million, or $0.37 per share, compared with $195 million, or $0.48 per share, in the second quarter of 2010.
NextEra Energy Resources second quarter results were largely driven by a stronger wind resource and contributions from new assets, including the 150-MW White Oak wind facility, offset by extended refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities as well as write-downs of certain assets in West Texas and the Northeast.
The companys existing wind assets added $0.07 in EPS, due largely to higher production and lower depreciation expense that was partially offset by lower West Texas pricing. The wind fleet produced roughly 766,000 additional megawatt-hours of electricity compared to the prior-year comparable quarter, driven by a stronger wind resource. The extended refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities negatively impacted EPS by $0.09.
 
2
 
NextEra Energy Resources also recognized an impairment charge of $0.08 due to certain asset write-downs.
Since late April of this year, NextEra Energy Resources has signed contracts for 632 MW of new wind generation, bringing total power purchase agreements signed for wind projects to be commissioned in the 2011-2014 timeframe to 1,585 MW. This total includes 469 MW for wind projects in Ontario, Canada, that the company expects to be online before the end of 2014.
NextEra Energy Resources continues to expect to add 1,400-2,000 MW to its wind portfolio in 2011 and 2012 combined, extending its lead as North Americas largest wind developer.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other reported $0.09 in earnings per share during the current quarter, compared to a loss of $0.01 in the second quarter of 2010. Current results benefitted primarily from the recognition of benefits associated with tax-law changes in several of the states in which the company does business.
Outlook
NextEra Energy continues to expect it will deliver adjusted earnings per share for 2011 in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. It also expects adjusted EPS will grow at an overall average rate of 5 percent to 7 percent through 2014 from a 2011 base.
NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no acquisitions or divestitures. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause NextEra Energy's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and FPL in this press release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, goals, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could have a significant impact on NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and/or FPL.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and NextEra Energy and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The business, financial results, financial condition and prospects of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond their control.  The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may adversely affect the business and may cause the actual results of NextEra Energy and FPL in future periods to differ substantially from those that NextEra Energy or FPL currently expects or seeks.  Many of the risks set forth below may only apply to a portion of the businesses of subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, such as its FPL business, its wind or solar generation development businesses, its transmission business or its gas infrastructure business.  Accordingly, references to NextEra Energy below in some instances refer to the applicable businesses or subsidiaries of NextEra Energy.  Risks specifically applicable to FPL generally include a reference to FPL.
 
4
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results may be adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their businesses.
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results could be negatively affected if they or their rate-regulated businesses are unable to recover, in a timely manner, certain costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital from customers through regulated rates and, in the case of FPL, cost recovery clauses.
 
5
 
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings which have significant compliance costs and expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.
NextEra Energy and FPL may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.

The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NextEra Energys and FPLs insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.
 
16
 
 
The businesses and financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL could be negatively affected by the lack of a qualified workforce, work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.
