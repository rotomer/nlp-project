(1)           fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares, earned at a deemed achievement level equal to the higher of (x) the Target number of Performance Shares set forth in this Agreement or (y) the average level (expressed as a percentage of the Target number of Performance Shares set forth in this Agreement) of achievement in respect of similar performance stock-based awards which matured over the three fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which such Change of Control occurred (such higher level, the Deemed Performance Award Achievement Level), shall vest upon such Change of Control and shall be payable as soon as practicable thereafter (but in all cases within thirty days after such Change of Control); and
(2)           the other fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares (earned at the Deemed Performance Award Achievement level calculated as set forth in subsection (1), above) shall vest on the date after such Change of Control which is the earlier of (i) one year after the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if the Grantee is then providing Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate), or (ii) the date on which the Grantee's Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate) terminates, and shall be payable (whether under clause (i) or clause (ii) of this section 2(b)(2)) as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event no later than the 15
th
day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the right to such payment arises).
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 2(a) and 4 hereof or any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan, if the Grantee is not a party to a Retention Agreement and so long as the Grantee is still providing Service upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined, as of the date hereof, in the Plan for all purposes of this Agreement), fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares, earned at the Deemed Performance Award Achievement Level, shall vest upon such Change in Control and shall be payable as soon as practicable thereafter (but in all cases within thirty days after such Change in Control).  The remainder of the Performance Shares shall remain outstanding (on a converted basis, if applicable) and shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.  If the Grantee provides Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate) from the date of such Change in Control to the date of the first anniversary of such Change in Control or if, prior to the first anniversary of such Change in Control, the Grantee is involuntarily terminated other than for Cause or Disability, the fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Change in Control that did not vest at the time of such Change in Control shall vest on the date which is the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of such Change in Control or (b) the date on which the Grantees Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate) terminates and shall be payable (whether under clause (a) or clause (b) of this section 2(c)) as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the right to such payment arises). The deemed level of achievement with respect to such awards shall be the Deemed Performance Award Achievement Level.
(d)  If, as a result of a Change in Control, shares of Stock are exchanged for or converted into a different form of equity security and/or the right to receive other property (including cash), payment in respect of the Performance Shares shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be made in the same form.

3.           .  Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, including section 5 hereof, and the Plan, the Option shall vest and the Grantee may exercise the Option in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in Schedule 1 (the Vesting Schedule).

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan, if (i) the Grantee is not a party to a Retention Agreement with the Company, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined, as of the date hereof, in the Plan for all purposes of this Agreement) then, so long as the Grantee is still providing Service on the date of such occurrence, the then-unvested portion of the Option shall vest upon such Change in Control, instead of in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in Schedule 1, and (ii) the Grantees Service is terminated other than for Cause during the 24-month period following a Change in Control, the portion of the Option that remains outstanding on the date of such termination may thereafter be exercised by the Grantee until the earlier of the second anniversary of the date of such termination or the expiration of the term of the Option.
If, as a result of a Change in Control, the shares of Stock are exchanged for or converted into a different form of equity security and/or the right to receive other property (including cash), the Option may be exercised, to the maximum extent practicable, in the same form.
4.           .  The Option shall expire on the date set forth in Schedule 1 (the Expiration Date), unless terminated earlier as set forth in section 5 hereof, and may not be exercised after the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date and (ii) the earlier termination date established in accordance with section 5 hereof.

6.           .  Subject to this Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by the transmittal of a written notice to the Company at its principal place of business.  Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock which the Grantee elects to purchase, shall be signed by the Grantee and shall be accompanied by payment of the Option Price for the shares of Stock which the Grantee elects to purchase.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee before the Option is exercised, such payment may be made in whole or in part (i) in cash or cash equivalents acceptable to the Company in the amount of the Option Price plus applicable tax withholding; (ii) by the tender or attestation to the Company of shares of Stock owned by the Grantee which, if acquired from the Company, have been owned for at least six months and acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued on the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required for payment; or (iii) by authorizing a Company-approved third party to remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Option Price and any tax withholding from such exercise.  The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate any provision of Applicable Laws, including applicable state or federal securities laws or the rules of any Stock Exchange on which the Stock is listed. If any Applicable Laws require the Company to take any action with respect to the shares of Stock specified in the written notice of exercise, or if any action remains to be taken under the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, as in effect at the time, to effect due issuance of such shares, then the Company shall take such action and the day for delivery of such shares shall be extended for the period necessary to take such action.  No Grantee shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company under the Option unless and until shares of Stock are fully paid and duly issued upon exercise of the Option.
Procedure for Exercise

The Option granted hereunder to the Grantee shall not be assignable or transferable by the Grantee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and such Option shall be exercisable, during the lifetime of the Grantee, only by the Grantee (or, in the event of the Grantee's legal incapacity or incompetency, the Grantee's guardian or legal representative).
