Exhibit 99
 
 
NextEra Energy announces third quarter 2011 earnings
 
JUNO BEACH, Fla.  NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported third quarter 2011 net income on a GAAP basis of $407 million, or $0.97 per share, compared with $720 million, or $1.74 per share, in the third quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energys earnings were $551 million, or $1.31 per share, compared with $602 million, or $1.45 per share, in the third quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities (NextEra Energy Resources), and the loss on the four gas-fired generation assets currently held for sale.
NextEra Energys management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the companys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energys management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energys fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

While our earnings this quarter were below the results in last years third quarter, they are consistent with our most recent earnings guidance. At Florida Power & Light Company, earnings per share were up approximately 12 percent over the prior-year comparable quarter, due to increased investment in the business. These investments are providing FPL customers with superior reliability and a typical bill that is the lowest in the state and more than 20 percent below the national average. At NextEra Energy Resources, we are very pleased to move forward with our two newest solar projects, Desert Sunlight and McCoy, which will add 525 megawatts to our solar project backlog. We now have 1,310 megawatts of new wind projects for which we already have long-term contracts that are scheduled to be placed into service in 2011 or 2012. As we continue to make considerable investments across the company, we are confident that NextEra Energys development pipeline provides tangible earnings growth prospects through 2014 and will enhance shareholder value.  This backlog supports our belief that we can deliver average adjusted earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent per year through 2014 from a 2011 range of $4.35 to $4.65, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported third quarter net income of $347 million, or $0.83 per share, compared to $308 million, or $0.74 per share, in the prior-year comparable quarter.
During the third quarter, FPLs earnings per share increased $0.09 over the prior-years comparable quarter, driven by rate base growth, as well as clause-related investments including the Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center and nuclear uprates at St. Lucie and Turkey Point.
Overall retail kilowatt-hour sales decreased by 2.4 percent, due primarily to less favorable weather as well as lower usage by customers, partially offset by the addition of 24,000 customers compared to the year-ago comparable quarter. FPL's customer base has now grown for seven consecutive year-over-year comparable quarters. Inactive meters have declined by approximately 4.4 percent since the end of last year's third quarter.
FPL plans to invest between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion between 2011 and 2014, including the modernizations of the Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach facilities, uprates at the St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear facilities, and the companys smart grid initiative. These investments, representing the companys largest-ever development cycle, are expected to provide significant operating efficiencies, environmental improvements, and reduced fuel costs and are designed to allow FPL to continue to supply affordable, reliable and clean energy to its customers.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy with generating facilities in 26 states and Canada, reported third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $67 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with $386 million, or $0.93 per share, in the prior-year comparable quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources earnings were $204 million, or $0.49 per share, compared with $267 million, or $0.64 per share, in the third quarter of 2010.
New wind and solar investment contributions decreased $0.06 relative to last years comparable quarter, as a result of lower convertible investment tax credit elections and lower state tax credits. The impact of existing assets was unchanged compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. Customer supply was down $0.06 due primarily to the challenges faced by Gexa, NextEra Energy Resources retail business in Texas, that were related to the impact of extreme hot weather in August. The proprietary trading business was down $0.07. The gas infrastructure business was up $0.05 compared to the prior year quarter.

With the additions of the Desert Sunlight and McCoy solar projects, NextEra Energy Resources now plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012 and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014 in solar opportunities. This is expected to add approximately 660 megawatts (MW) of solar to the portfolio between 2011 and 2014, and an additional approximately 280 MW between 2015 and 2016.
NextEra Energy Resources continues to expect to add 1,400-2,000 MW to its wind portfolio in 2011 and 2012 combined, extending its lead as North Americas largest wind developer, with plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012 and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. The 2013 to 2014 backlog includes Canadian wind projects that have qualified for a feed-in-tariff.
Outlook
NextEra Energy continues to expect it will deliver adjusted earnings per share for 2011 at the lower end of the range of $4.35 to $4.65.  For 2012, the company believes that adjusted earnings per share will fall in a range of $4.35 to $4.65.  It also continues to expect it will deliver average adjusted earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent per year through 2014 from a 2011 range of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to adjusted earnings per share expectations of $5.05 to $5.65 in 2014.
NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges, and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time, and the loss on the four gas-fired generation assets currently held for sale. In addition, NextEra Energys adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and supply chain expansion for wind and solar; transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no acquisitions or divestitures; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to federal or state tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. These earnings expectations should be read in conjunction with NextEra Energys current and periodic reports filed with the SEC, which may include other items that may affect future results.

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause NextEra Energy's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and FPL in this news release, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, goals, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could have a significant impact on NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and/or FPL.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and NextEra Energy and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The business, financial results, financial condition and prospects of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond their control.  The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may adversely affect the business and may cause the actual results of NextEra Energy and FPL in future periods to differ substantially from those that NextEra Energy or FPL currently expects or seeks.  Many of the risks set forth below may only apply to a portion of the businesses of subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, such as its FPL business, its wind or solar generation development businesses, its transmission business or its gas infrastructure business.  Accordingly, references to NextEra Energy below in some instances refer to the applicable businesses or subsidiaries of NextEra Energy.  Risks specifically applicable to FPL generally include a reference to FPL.
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results may be adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their businesses.
 
4
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results could be negatively affected if they or their rate-regulated businesses are unable to recover, in a timely manner, certain costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital from customers through regulated rates and, in the case of FPL, cost recovery clauses.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings which have significant compliance costs and expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.
 
5
 
NextEra Energy and FPL may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.
NextEra Energys and FPLs businesses are subject to risks associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase their cost of operations and may expose them to liabilities.
 
6
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs businesses could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of GHG emissions.
The construction, operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities involve risks that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear generation facilities owned by NextEra Energy or FPL and in increased costs and capital expenditures.
 
7

8
 
 
The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL.
The occurrence of any of these effects or events could result in, among other matters, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines, replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet contractual obligations.  Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or increased expenses.  Breakdown or failure of an operating facility of NextEra Energy, for example, may prevent NextEra Energy from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in some situations, could result in termination of the agreement or subject NextEra Energy to liability for liquidated damages.  The operation and maintenance of NextEra Energys gas infrastructure and power transmission businesses also are subject to many of the foregoing risks or substantially similar risks.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to operating risks associated with their natural gas and oil storage and pipeline infrastructure, and the use of such fuels in their generation facilities.
NextEra Energys competitive energy business is subject to development and operating risks that could limit the revenue growth of this business and have other negative effects on NextEra Energys financial results.
 
 
9

11
 
 
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may negatively affect NextEra Energys and FPLs ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NextEra Energy and FPL and exert downward pressure on the market price of NextEra Energys common stock.
NextEra Energys, Capital Holdings and FPLs inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect NextEra Energys and FPLs liquidity, limit the ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to grow their businesses, and increase interest costs, while the liquidity of the companies also could be impaired by the inability of their credit providers to maintain their current credit ratings or to fund their credit commitments.
The use of derivative contracts by NextEra Energy and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that could adversely affect their financial results and liquidity.
 
 
 
12
 
NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if the rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) broaden the scope of its provisions regarding the regulation of OTC financial derivatives and make them applicable to NextEra Energy and FPL.
 
13
 
NextEra Energys ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.

15
 
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NextEra Energys and FPLs businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact the operations of NextEra Energy and FPL in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results and liquidity.
The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NextEra Energys and FPLs insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.
The businesses and financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL could be negatively affected by the lack of a qualified workforce, work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.
 
 
16
 
 
Certain of NextEra Energy's and FPL's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's liquidity and financial results.
Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results.
