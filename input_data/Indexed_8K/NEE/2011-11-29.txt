REGULATION FD
Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
During the period from November 29 to December 9, 2011, members of NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NextEra Energy) management team plans to discuss, at various investor meetings in New York, NY and certain Mid-Atlantic states, and through participation at the Goldman Sachs Sixth Annual Clean Energy and Power Conference in New York, NY, among other topics, NextEra Energy's long-term growth expectations, including reaffirmation of NextEra Energy's previously disclosed (i) 2011 adjusted earnings per share expectations towards the low end of the range of $4.35 to $4.65, (ii) 2012 adjusted earnings per share expectations of $4.35 to $4.65 and (iii) average adjusted earnings per share growth expectations of approximately 5% to 7% per year through 2014 from a 2011 adjusted earnings per share base of $4.35 to $4.65, equating to a 2014 range of $5.05 to $5.65.  NextEra Energy's 2011 and 2012 adjusted earnings per share expectations and average adjusted earnings per share growth expectations should be viewed in conjunction with NextEra Energy's cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below.  The 2011 and 2012 adjusted earnings per share expectations and average adjusted earnings per share growth expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's (NextEra Energy Resources) nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time, as well as, for 2011, the expected loss on five of NextEra Energy Resources' gas-fired generation assets sold or currently held for sale.  Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Cautionary Statements And Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results
In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause NextEra Energy's or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and FPL in this Form 8-K, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will, will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, goals, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could have a significant impact on NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NextEra Energy's and/or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of NextEra Energy and/or FPL.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and NextEra Energy and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including, but not limited to, unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
The business, financial results, financial condition and prospects of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond their control.  The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may adversely affect the business and may cause the actual results of NextEra Energy and FPL in future periods to differ substantially from those that NextEra Energy or FPL currently expects or seeks.  Many of the risks set forth below may only apply to a portion of the businesses of subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, such as its FPL business, its wind or solar generation development businesses, its transmission business or its gas infrastructure business.  Accordingly, references to NextEra Energy below in some instances refer to the applicable businesses or subsidiaries of NextEra Energy.  Risks specifically applicable to FPL generally include a reference to FPL.
NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results may be adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their businesses.
2
NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results could be negatively affected if they or their rate-regulated businesses are unable to recover, in a timely manner, certain costs, a return on certain assets or an appropriate return on capital from customers through regulated rates and, in the case of FPL, cost recovery clauses.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings which have significant compliance costs and expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.
NextEra Energy and FPL may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.
NextEra Energy's and FPL's businesses are subject to risks associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives.
3
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase their cost of operations and may expose them to liabilities.
NextEra Energy's and FPL's businesses could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of GHG emissions.
The construction, operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities involve risks that could result in fines or the closure of nuclear generation facilities owned by NextEra Energy or FPL and in increased costs and capital expenditures.
4
NextEra Energy's and FPL's operating results could suffer if they do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, generation, transmission, distribution or other facilities on schedule or within budget.
The operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL.
5
The occurrence of any of these effects or events could result in, among other matters, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines, replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet contractual obligations.  Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or increased expenses.  Breakdown or failure of an operating facility of NextEra Energy, for example, may prevent NextEra Energy from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in some situations, could result in termination of the agreement or subject NextEra Energy to liability for liquidated damages.  The operation and maintenance of NextEra Energy's gas infrastructure and power transmission businesses also are subject to many of the foregoing risks or substantially similar risks.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to operating risks associated with their natural gas and oil storage and pipeline infrastructure, and the use of such fuels in their generation facilities.
NextEra Energy's competitive energy business is subject to development and operating risks that could limit the revenue growth of this business and have other negative effects on NextEra Energy's financial results.
6
NextEra Energy's competitive energy business is dependent on continued public policy support and governmental support for renewable energy, particularly wind and solar projects.
NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, counterparties and vendors.
NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results may continue to be negatively affected by slower customer growth and customer usage.
NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results are subject to risks associated with weather conditions, such as the impact of severe weather.
7
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may negatively affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NextEra Energy and FPL and exert downward pressure on the market price of NextEra Energy's common stock.
NextEra Energy's, Capital Holdings' and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's liquidity, limit the ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to grow their businesses, and increase interest costs, while the liquidity of the companies also could be impaired by the inability of their credit providers to maintain their current credit ratings or to fund their credit commitments.
The use of derivative contracts by NextEra Energy and FPL in the normal course of business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash collateral that could adversely affect their financial results and liquidity.
8
NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if the rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) broaden the scope of its provisions regarding the regulation of OTC financial derivatives and make them applicable to NextEra Energy and FPL.
NextEra Energy's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.
NextEra Energy may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NextEra Energy or if NextEra Energy is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.
9
Changes in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results, financial condition and liquidity.
NextEra Energy's and FPL's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to their reputation and/or the financial results of the retail business.
A failure in NextEra Energy's and FPL's operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair their liquidity, disrupt their businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information and adversely affect their financial results.
10
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NextEra Energy's and FPL's businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact the operations of NextEra Energy and FPL in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results and liquidity.
The ability of NextEra Energy and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NextEra Energy's and FPL's insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.
The businesses and financial results of NextEra Energy and FPL could be negatively affected by the lack of a qualified workforce, work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.
Certain of NextEra Energy's and FPL's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's liquidity and financial results.
11
Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect NextEra Energy's and FPL's financial results.
The risks described herein are not the only risks facing NextEra Energy and FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to NextEra Energy or FPL, or that are currently deemed to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect NextEra Energy's or FPL's business, financial condition, future financial results and/or liquidity.
