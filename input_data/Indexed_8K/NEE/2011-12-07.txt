SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS
Item 8.01  Other Events
On December 7, 2011, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) purchased approximately 6.7 million shares of its common stock at a price of $55.76 per share for an aggregate price of $375 million pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement entered into by NextEra Energy under its previously disclosed share repurchase plan.
NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, recently closed on a sale of four natural gas-fired power plants and expects to close on the sale of a fifth natural gas-fired power plant in the coming weeks.  These transactions are e
xpected to generate in the aggregate approximately $825 million in cash, a portion of which will be used to repurchase the common stock.  NextEra Energy believes that using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the plants to repurchase shares is consistent with NextEra Energy's overall strategy of maintaining a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating.  
The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR agreement will be determined upon final settlement of the transaction, which is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2012. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, NextEra Energy may receive additional shares of common stock or be required to remit a settlement amount, payable, at NextEra Energy's option, in cash or common stock, based on a discount to the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of its common stock during a period of up to approximately three months. All of the repurchased shares will be retired.
