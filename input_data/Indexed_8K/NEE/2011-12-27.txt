SECTION 2 FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On December 21, 2011, Redwood Trails Wind, LLC (Redwood Trails Wind), an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources), borrowed approximately $234 million under a limited-recourse senior secured variable rate term loan agreement. NextEra Energy Resources is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc.  Interest on the loan is based on the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate plus a specified margin.  Interest on the loan is payable quarterly and principal on the loan is payable semiannually.  The loan matures in December 2029. Upon funding of the loan, Redwood Trails Wind entered into several interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate movements with respect to interest payments on the loan.  Substantially all of the loan proceeds were used to reimburse NextEra Energy Resources, in part, for its capital contribution related to the development and construction of wind generation facilities with a generating capability totaling approximately 237 megawatts located in California and Oklahoma.  The loan is secured by liens on those wind generating facilities' assets, and certain other assets of, and the ownership interest in, Redwood Trails Wind and the entities that own the facilities, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Redwood Trails Wind.  The loan agreement
contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to the failure to make required payments or to observe other covenants in the loan agreement and related documents, actions by Redwood Trails Wind or by other parties under specified agreements relating to the generating facilities or the loan agreement, the termination of certain of such specified agreements and certain bankruptcy-related events. 
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
