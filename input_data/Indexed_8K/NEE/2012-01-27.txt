Exhibit 99
NextEra Energy reports 2011 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings
JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2011 fourth-quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $667 million, or $1.59 per share, compared with $263 million, or $0.63 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's earnings were $395 million, or $0.93 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $332 million, or $0.80 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, as well as the loss on certain gas-fired generation assets sold in 2011, all of which relate primarily to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities (Energy Resources).
For the full-year 2011, NextEra Energy reported net income on a GAAP basis of $1.92 billion, or $4.59 per share, compared with $1.96 billion, or $4.74 per share, in 2010. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's 2011 earnings were $1.84 billion, or $4.39 per share, for the full year, compared with $1.78 billion, or $4.30 per share, in 2010.
NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
NextEra Energy delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter and overall for 2011. At Florida Power & Light, earnings growth was driven by investments in the business, including new efficient power generation, that are helping to provide our customers with the lowest bills in the state and reliability that is among the best in the country. At NextEra Energy Resources, we signed nearly 2,200 megawatts of long-term wind and solar contracts in 2011, our most ever in a single year, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.

Florida Power & Light Company
Fourth-quarter 2011 net income for FPL, NextEra Energy's principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, was $216 million, or $0.51 per share, compared with $181 million, or $0.43 per share, in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, net income was $1.07 billion, or $2.55 per share, compared with $945 million, or $2.29 per share, in 2010. During 2011, the company deployed more than $3 billion in capital on projects providing significant customer benefits.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, FPL's earnings increased over the prior-year comparable quarter primarily as a result of investments in the business. FPL's fourth-quarter 2011 retail sales of electricity declined by 2.7 percent from the prior-year comparable quarter, due primarily to milder weather. Excluding the impact of weather, underlying usage rose 1.2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2011. FPL had approximately 25,000 more customers than during the prior-year comparable period of 2010.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a reduction in FPL's fuel charge that, in combination with adjustments to other components of the bill, will produce a net decrease on a typical FPL customer's monthly bill in 2012 of about $2.
The PSC also approved FPL's application for $196 million in cost recovery related to uprates underway at the Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear facilities as well as the planned construction of Turkey Point Units 6 and 7.
The main drivers of FPL's full-year 2011 earnings growth were the investments in clean and efficient power generation. For the full year, weather normalized sales were slightly positive and underlying usage was roughly flat compared to 2010.
Operationally, FPL's fossil fuel fleet set a new record for its fuel efficiency in 2011, bringing its systemwide heat rate down to 7,803 British thermal units (BTU) per kilowatt hour. The average heat rate for the industry was 10,045 BTUs per kilowatt hour for 2010, the most recent year for which data are available. Since 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 19 percent, resulting in more than $5.5 billion in savings for customers, including more than $650 million in 2011, as a result of increased fuel efficiency. FPL's service reliability, as measured by the System Average Interruption Duration Index, was in the top quartile of utilities nationwide in 2011. FPL's O&M expenses for all of 2011 were 1.64 cents per retail kilowatt hour sales, compared with the latest available industry average of 2.28 cents per retail kilowatt hour sales.
Earlier this month, FPL notified the PSC that it expects to ask for an increase, effective in 2013, that is currently estimated at $6.80 a month, or about 23 cents a day, on the base portion of a typical residential bill to maintain its superior performance for customers. Because of projected fuel savings resulting from investments in more efficient power generation, as well as lower fuel prices and other adjustments, the net increase that a typical residential customer would pay is currently estimated at no more than $3 a month, or about 10 cents a day.
Energy Resources
Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported fourth-quarter 2011 net income on a GAAP basis of $402 million, or $0.96 per share, compared with $73 million, or $0.17 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Energy Resources' earnings were $128 million, or $0.30 per share, compared with $143 million, or $0.34 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full-year 2011, Energy Resources reported net income on a GAAP basis of $774 million, or $1.85 per share, compared with $980 million, or $2.37 per share, in 2010. On an adjusted basis, Energy Resources' earnings were $679 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with $800 million, or $1.93 per share, for the full-year 2010.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, Energy Resources' earnings were driven primarily by a stronger wind resource from existing wind assets relative to the prior-year comparable quarter, adding approximately 580,000 megawatt hours of generation compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. This was more than offset by the negative impact of an unplanned outage and lower availability at the Seabrook Station nuclear facility.
2
The main drivers of Energy Resources' full-year 2011 earnings were higher wind generation from existing wind assets due to a wind resource that increased from the previous year to near average levels, as well as greater contributions from the gas infrastructure business. These were more than offset by fewer megawatts of Convertible Investment Tax Credit projects, by extended and unplanned outages as well as lower hedge prices at Seabrook Station, by lower earnings from the customer supply and proprietary trading businesses, by higher interest expense due to growth in the business, and by asset impairment charges recognized in the second quarter. Operationally, the company's non-nuclear power-generating facilities performed exceptionally well, with one of the lowest forced-outage rates the company has ever recorded.
The company also made progress during 2011 in signing power purchase agreements for the output of its wind fleet. The company entered into long-term contracts for more than 1,600 megawatts of wind power during the year with expected in-service dates through 2014. The company ended the year as the largest owner of wind generation in North America, adding approximately 380 megawatts in the year, and remains on track to add approximately 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts of new wind assets to the portfolio in 2011 and 2012.
On the solar front, the company has 940 megawatts of already-contracted solar projects expected to enter service from 2011 to 2016, including the company's 50 percent portion of the recently announced Desert Sunlight project and the recently announced McCoy photovoltaic project in California. Including all of the planned solar projects that are already under long-term contract, Energy Resources plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012 and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014 in solar development projects. The backlog of contracted solar opportunities is expected to begin contributing meaningfully to cash flow and earnings in 2013.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other's fourth-quarter 2011 contribution to earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.12, compared with $0.03 per share in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the full year, Corporate and Other contributed $0.19 per share in 2011, compared with $0.08 per share in 2010.
For the full-year 2011 on an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other contributed $0.22 per share, compared with a contribution of $0.08 per share for the prior year. Corporate and Other's adjusted earnings growth was driven primarily by certain consolidated income tax adjustments.
Outlook
For 2012, NextEra Energy currently expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. It also continues to expect that adjusted earnings per share will grow at an overall average rate of 5 percent to 7 percent through 2014, from a 2011 base, which equates to a 2014 adjusted earnings per share range of $5.05 to $5.65.
NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time, and the loss on the five gas-fired generation assets sold during 2011. In addition, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no acquisitions or divestitures; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to federal or state tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
