Exhibit 99
NextEra Energy announces first quarter earnings for 2012
JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2012 first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $461 million, or $1.11 per share, compared with $268 million, or $0.64 per share, in the first quarter of 2011. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's earnings were $422 million, or $1.02 per share, compared with $392 million, or $0.94 per share, in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities.
NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the first quarter of 2012. At Florida Power & Light Company, earnings growth was driven by increased investments in the business that are helping to provide our customers with the lowest bills in the state and reliability that is among the best in the country. At NextEra Energy Resources, results were supported by improved wind resource and new wind projects; and we continue to drive development of our largest-ever backlog of contracted renewable projects, said NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO Lew Hay.
Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported first quarter net income of $239 million, or $0.58 per share, compared with $205 million, or $0.49 per share, for the prior-year quarter.
1
The main driver of FPL's growth was continued investment in the business. During the quarter, the company invested approximately $1.3 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion the company expects to invest in 2012, and regulatory capital employed grew 15.6 percent compared to the prior-year quarter. Given the development projects currently approved by the Florida Public Service Commission and the normal pattern of investment in the business, FPL expects to invest approximately $15 billion over the five-year period 2010 through 2014, or approximately $3 billion per year. This is the largest investment wave in the company's history, and FPL expects these investments collectively will produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, better reliability, and cleaner air. These investments will also enhance FPL's ability to keep customers' bills the lowest in the state.
During the quarter, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's need determination request for the proposed modernization of the Port Everglades generation facility. FPL expects the new high-efficiency combined-cycle natural gas-fired energy center will produce more than $400 million in customer savings over the life of the facility compared to keeping the existing facility in the fleet. A modernized Port Everglades facility is also expected to improve air quality by significantly reducing all major air pollutants.
On March 19, FPL filed its formal request for a base rate increase of $6.97 a month, or about 23 cents a day, on the base portion of a typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill offset in part by an estimated $4.49 a month net decrease in other components of a typical bill, including lower fuel usage, lower fuel prices and other adjustments. As a result, the typical residential customer bill would increase about $2.48 a month, or about 8 cents a day - a 2.6 percent increase.
The adjustment will cover the capital and non-fuel expenses of a new, high-efficiency natural gas power plant at Cape Canaveral after it enters service in June 2013, as well as other increases in the cost of doing business. The new plant at Cape Canaveral will use considerably less fuel to generate electricity, which in turn helps to keep customer bills low over the long term and reduces the impact of the base rate request. Even after the increase, FPL's typical residential customer bill is expected to remain the lowest of the state's 55 electric utilities and well below the national average.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $221 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with $65 million, or $0.16 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings were $182 million, or $0.44 per share, compared with $189 million, or $0.46 per share, in the first quarter of 2011.
NextEra Energy Resources' adjusted earnings were driven by contributions from new wind assets that entered service since the first quarter of last year, which added $0.07 of adjusted EPS, including convertible investment tax credit elections. The company's gas infrastructure business also increased adjusted EPS by $0.07, including $0.06 associated with terminating hedges on certain planned wells that the company no longer plans to pursue.
These results were offset by lower adjusted EPS from the company's existing assets of $0.11. Existing wind assets decreased $0.07 in adjusted EPS relative to last year's comparable quarter due to a combination of favorable state tax credits recorded last year as well as lower federal production tax credits, lower energy prices, and higher operating expenses. These items were partially offset by favorable wind energy production. Net wind energy generation increased by 545,000 megawatt hours compared to last year's comparable quarter. Lower earnings at the Seabrook Station nuclear facility negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04. All other remaining items negatively impacted results by $0.05 in adjusted EPS and reflect lower contributions from the company's customer supply and proprietary trading business, as well as higher costs associated with the growth of the business.
2
In the first quarter, the company added approximately 177 megawatts of generation to what is the largest wind generation fleet in the United States. The business remains on track to add approximately 1,300 megawatts of new U.S. wind assets to the portfolio in 2012 and approximately 600 megawatts of contracted Canadian wind between 2012 and 2015. Additionally, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Resources completed the acquisition of the 40-megawatt St. Clair photovoltaic solar facility in Ontario, and remains on track to add roughly 900 megawatts of contracted solar generation to the portfolio between 2012 and 2016.
Outlook
For 2012, NextEra Energy currently expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. It also continues to expect that adjusted earnings per share in 2014 will be in the range of $5.05 to $5.65.
NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no acquisitions or divestitures; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to federal or state tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
