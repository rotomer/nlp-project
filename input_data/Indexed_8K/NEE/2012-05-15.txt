One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture
Relating to $600,000,000 Principal Amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 4.05% Series due June  1, 2042
Dated as of May 1, 2012
This Supplemental Indenture has been executed in several counterparts, all of which constitute but one and the same instrument. This Supplemental Indenture has been recorded in several counties and documentary stamp taxes as required by law in the amount of $2,100,000 and non-recurring intangible taxes as required by law in the amount of $106,058 were paid on the Supplemental Indenture recorded in the public records of Palm Beach County, Florida.
Note to Examiner
: The new bonds (New Bonds) being issued in connection with this Supplemental Indenture are secured by real property and personal property located both within Florida and outside of Florida. The aggregate fair market value of the collateral exceeds the aggregate principal amount of (y) the New Bonds plus (z) the other outstanding bonds secured by the mortgage supplemented hereby and all previous supplemental indentures thereto. The intangible tax has been computed pursuant to Section 199.133 (2), Florida Statutes, by (i) determining the percentage of the aggregate fair market value of the collateral constituting real property situated in Florida and by multiplying that percentage times the principal amount of the New Bonds (the result hereinafter defined as the Tax Base) and (ii) multiplying the tax rate times the Tax Base.
ONE HUNDRED NINETEENTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE

WHEREAS, by an instrument, dated as of April 15, 2002, filed with the Banking Department of the State of New York, Bankers Trust Company effected a corporate name change pursuant to which, effective such date, it is known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas; and

or may establish the terms and provisions of any series of bonds other than said first series, by an instrument in writing executed and acknowledged by FPL in such manner as would be necessary to entitle a conveyance of real estate to be recorded in all of the states in which any property at the time subject to the Lien of the Mortgage shall be situated; and
WHEREAS, FPL now desires to create the series of bonds described in
Article I
hereof and to add to its covenants and agreements contained in the Mortgage certain other covenants and agreements to be observed by it and to alter and amend in certain respects the covenants and provisions contained in the Mortgage; and

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD all such properties, real, personal and mixed, granted, bargained, sold, released, conveyed, assigned, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, set over or confirmed by FPL as aforesaid, or intended so to be, unto Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the Trustee, and its successors and assigns forever.
IN TRUST NEVERTHELESS, for the same purposes and upon the same terms, trusts and conditions and subject to and with the same provisos and covenants as are set forth in the Mortgage, as heretofore supplemented, this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture being supplemental thereto.
AND IT IS HEREBY COVENANTED by FPL that all terms, conditions, provisos, covenants and provisions contained in the Mortgage shall affect and apply to the property hereinbefore described and conveyed and to the estate, rights, obligations and duties of FPL and the Trustee and the beneficiaries of the trust with respect to said property, and to the Trustee and its successors as Trustee of said property in the same manner and with the same effect as if said property had been owned by FPL at the time of the execution of the Mortgage, and had been specifically and at length described in and conveyed to said Trustee, by the Mortgage as a part of the property therein stated to be conveyed.
FPL further covenants and agrees to and with the Trustee and its successors in said trust under the Mortgage, as follows:
ARTICLE I
One Hundred Sixteenth Series of Bonds
Section 1. (I) There shall be a series of bonds designated 4.05% Series due June 1, 2042, herein sometimes referred to as the 
One Hundred Sixteenth Series
, each of which shall also bear the descriptive title First Mortgage Bond, and the form thereof, which shall be established by Resolution of the Board of Directors of FPL, shall contain suitable provisions with respect to the matters hereinafter in this Section specified. Bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series shall mature on June 1, 2042 and shall be issued as fully registered bonds in denominations of One Thousand Dollars and, at the option of FPL, in integral multiples of One Thousand Dollars (the
exercise of such option to be evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof); they shall bear interest at the rate of 4.05% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year (each an 
Interest Payment Date
) commencing on December 1, 2012; the principal of and interest on each said bond to be payable at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts. Bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series shall be dated as in
Section 10
of the Mortgage provided. The record date for payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date shall be the close of business on (1) the Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date so long as the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series are held by a securities depository in bookentry only form or (2) the 15th calendar day immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date if the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series are not held by a securities depository in bookentry only form. Interest on the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series will accrue from and including May 15, 2012 to but excluding December 1, 2012 and, thereafter, from and including the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (and if no interest has been paid on the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series, from May 15, 2012) to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. No interest will accrue on a bond of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series for the day on which such bond matures. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semiannual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the number of days in the period using 30day calendar months. If any date on which interest, principal or premium is payable on the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest, principal or premium payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and no interest or payment will be paid in respect of the delay. A Business Day is any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions or trust companies in New York City are generally authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.
(II)
Bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series shall be redeemable either at the option of FPL or pursuant to the requirements of the Mortgage (including, among other requirements, the application of cash delivered to or deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of
Section 64
of the Mortgage or with proceeds of Released Property) in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to maturity, upon notice, as provided in
Section 52
of the Mortgage, mailed at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the 
Redemption Date
) at the applicable price (the
Redemption Price
) described below. If FPL redeems all or any part of the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series at any time prior to December 1, 2041, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date plus a premium, if any (the 
MakeWhole Premium
). In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
The amount of the MakeWhole Premium with respect to any bond of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 15 basis points.
The MakeWhole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by FPL;
provided
that if FPL fails to make such appointment at least 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC or RBS Securities Inc. or if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee in consultation with, and at the expense of, FPL (in any such case, an 
Independent Investment Banker
).
For purposes of determining the MakeWhole Premium, 
Treasury Yield
 means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the 
Remaining Term
). The Independent Investment Banker will determine the Treasury Yield as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates or any successor release (the 
H.15 Statistical Release
). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be
calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation will be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
If FPL redeems all or any part of the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series at any time on or after December 1, 2041, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
(III)
At the option of the registered owner any bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series, upon surrender thereof for exchange at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, together with a written instrument of transfer wherever required by FPL, duly executed by the registered owner or by his duly authorized attorney, shall (subject to the provisions of
Section 12
of the Mortgage) be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of bonds of the same series of other authorized denominations.
Bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series shall be transferable (subject to the provisions of
Section 12
of the Mortgage) at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
Upon any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series, FPL may make a charge therefor sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge, as provided in
Section 12
of the Mortgage, but FPL hereby waives any right to make a charge in addition thereto for any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series.
ARTICLE II
Dividend Covenant
Section 2.
Section 3
of the Third Supplemental Indenture, as heretofore amended, is hereby further amended by inserting the words or One Hundred Sixteenth Series immediately before the words remain Outstanding.
ARTICLE III
Miscellaneous Provisions
Section 3. Subject to the amendments provided for in this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture, the terms defined in the Mortgage, as heretofore supplemented, shall, for all purposes of this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture, have the meanings specified
in the Mortgage, as heretofore supplemented.
Section 4. The holders of bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series consent that FPL may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of bonds of the One Hundred Sixteenth Series entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, those persons who were holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such persons continue to be holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.
Section 5. The Trustee hereby accepts the trust herein declared, provided, created or supplemented and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein and in the Mortgage, as heretofore supplemented, set forth and upon the following terms and conditions:
The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made by FPL solely. In general, each and every term and condition contained in
Article XVII
of the Mortgage, as heretofore amended, shall apply to and form part of this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture with the same force and effect as if the same were herein set forth in full with such omissions, variations and insertions, if any, as may be appropriate to make the same conform to the provisions of this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture.
Section 6. Whenever in this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture either of the parties hereto is named or referred to, this shall, subject to the provisions of
Articles XVI and XVII
of the Mortgage, as heretofore amended, be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party, and all the covenants and agreements in this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture contained by or on behalf of FPL, or by or on behalf of the Trustee, or either of them, shall, subject as aforesaid, bind and inure to the respective benefits of the respective successors and assigns of such parties, whether so expressed or not.
Section 7. Nothing in this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture, expressed or implied, is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon, or to give to, any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and the holders of the bonds and coupons Outstanding under the Mortgage, any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture or any covenant, condition, stipulation, promise or agreement hereof, and all the covenants, conditions, stipulations, promises and agreements in this One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture contained by or on behalf of FPL shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, and of the holders of the bonds and coupons Outstanding under the Mortgage.
Section 8. The Mortgage, as heretofore supplemented and amended and as supplemented hereby, is intended by the parties hereto, as to properties now or hereafter encumbered thereby and located within the States of Florida and Georgia, to operate and is to be construed as granting a lien
only on such properties and not as a deed passing title thereto.
Section 9. This One Hundred Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture shall be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, FPL has caused its corporate name to be hereunto affixed, and this instrument to be signed and sealed by its President or one of its Vice Presidents, and its corporate seal to be attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries for and in its behalf, and DEUTSCHE BANK TRUST COMPANY AMERICAS has caused its corporate name to be hereunto affixed, and this instrument to be signed and sealed by its Vice Presidents or Assistant Vice Presidents, and its corporate seal to be attested by one of its Vice Presidents, Assistant Vice Presidents, one of its Assistant Secretaries or one of its Associates, all as of the day and year first above written.

Florida Power & Light Company
700 Universe Boulevard
Juno Beach, Florida 33408

We have participated in the preparation of or reviewed (1) Registration Statement Nos. 333160987, 33316098701, 33316098702, 33316098703, 33316098704, 33316098705, 33316098706, 33316098707 and 33316098708 (the Registration Statement), which Registration Statement was filed jointly by the Company, NextEra Energy, Inc.

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Bonds are legally issued, valid and binding obligations of the Company, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting mortgagees' and other creditors' rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity.
In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that the certificates representing the Bonds conform to specimens examined by us and that the Bonds have been duly authenticated, in accordance with the Mortgage, by the Mortgage Trustee under the Mortgage, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
We hereby consent to the reference to us in the Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement under the caption Legal Opinions and to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on or about May 15, 2012, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
