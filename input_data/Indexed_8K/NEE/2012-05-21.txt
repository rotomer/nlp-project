Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to NextEra Energy, Inc., a Florida corporation (formerly known as FPL Group, Inc., NEE), and NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation (formerly known as FPL Group Capital Inc, NEE Capital), in connection with the remarketing of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of NEE Capitals Series C Debentures due June 1, 2014 (the Debentures) issued on May 26, 2009 under the Indenture (For Unsecured Debt Securities), dated as of June 1, 1999 (the Indenture), between NEE Capital and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the Trustee), which Debentures are absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed (the Guarantee) by NEE pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999, between NEE, as Guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Guarantee Trustee (the Guarantee Agreement).
We have participated in the preparation of or reviewed (1) Registration Statement Nos. 333160987, 33316098701, 33316098702, 33316098703, 33316098704, 33316098705, 33316098706, 33316098707 and 33316098708 (the Registration Statement), which Registration Statement was filed jointly by NEE, NEE Capital, Florida Power & Light Company, FPL Group Capital Trust II, FPL Group Capital Trust III, FPL Group Trust I, FPL Group Trust II, Florida Power & Light Company Trust I and Florida Power & Light Company Trust II with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); (2) the prospectus dated August 3, 2009 (the Base Prospectus) forming a part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated May 16, 2012 (the Prospectus Supplement) relating to the remarketing of the Debentures, both such Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; (3) the Indenture; (4) the Guarantee Agreement; (5) the corporate proceedings of NEE with respect to the Registration Statement, the Guarantee and the Guarantee Agreement; (6) the corporate proceedings of NEE Capital with respect to the Registration Statement, the Indenture and the Debentures; and (7) such other corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Debentures and the Guarantee, as it relates to the Debentures, are legally issued, valid, and binding obligations of NEE Capital and NEE, respectively, except as limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity.
In rendering the foregoing opinions, we have assumed that the certificates representing the Debentures conform to specimens examined by us and that the Debentures have been duly authenticated, in accordance with the Indenture, by the Trustee under the Indenture and the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
We hereby consent to the reference to us in the Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement under the caption Legal Opinions and to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by NEE on or about May 21, 2012, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
