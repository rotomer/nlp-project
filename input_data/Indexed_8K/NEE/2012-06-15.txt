OFFICERS CERTIFICATE
Creating the Series H Junior Subordinated Debentures due June 15, 2072
Aldo Portales, Assistant Treasurer of NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group Capital Inc) (the 
Company
), and Aldo Portales, Assistant Treasurer of NextEra Energy, Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group, Inc.) (the 
Guarantor
), pursuant to the authority granted in the accompanying Board Resolutions (all capitalized terms used herein which are not defined herein or in
Exhibit A
hereto, but which are defined in the Indenture referred to below, shall have the meanings specified in the Indenture), and pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture, do hereby certify to The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) (the 
Trustee
), as Trustee under the Indenture (For Unsecured Subordinated Debt Securities) dated as of September 1, 2006 among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the 
Indenture
), that:
Debentures of the Eighth Series are registered, subject to certain exceptions, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
The amount of interest payable for any quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any period shorter than a full quarterly period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30-day calendar months). If an Interest Payment Date, a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity Date of the Debentures of the Eighth Series falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, the Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity Date, as applicable.
Optional Deferral Period
);
provided
that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity Date or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date. During the Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided for in
Exhibit A
hereto, as if the interest payment had not been so deferred) will be compounded quarterly. Any deferred interest on the Debentures of the Eighth Series will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the interest rate borne by the Debentures of the Eighth Series, to the extent permitted by applicable law. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, including Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, to the Person in whose name the Debentures of the Eighth Series are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended;
provided
that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity Date or any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. With respect to the Debentures of the Eighth Series, the term 
Interest Period
 shall mean each period from, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, except that the first Interest Period shall commence on the date of original issuance. However, during any such Optional Deferral Period, neither the Guarantor nor the Company will, and each will cause their majorityowned subsidiaries not to:
(A)
declare or pay any dividend or distribution on the Guarantors or the Companys capital stock;
(B)
redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of the Guarantors or the Companys capital stock;
(C)
pay any principal, interest or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of the Guarantors or the Companys debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or junior to, the Debentures of the Eighth Series or the Guarantee (as the case may be); or
(D)
make any payments with respect to any Guarantor or Company guarantee of debt securities if such guarantee is equal or junior in right of payment to the Debentures of the Eighth Series or the Guarantee (as the case may be).
Subject to the reservation of right to amend
clause (f)
below, as described in
paragraph 15
hereof, the foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Guarantor or the Company from making:
(a)
purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;
(b)
any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clauses (A) and (B) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock;
(c)

(e)
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future;
(f)

(g)
payments under any guarantee of junior subordinated debentures, which guarantee is executed and delivered by the Guarantor (including a Guarantee under the Indenture), so long as the amount of payments made on any junior subordinated debentures is paid on all junior subordinated debentures then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of junior subordinated debentures is then entitled if paid in full;
(h)
dividends or distributions by the Company on its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor; or
(i)
redemptions, purchases, acquisitions or liquidation payments by the Company with respect to its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor.
Prior to the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest,
provided
that such Optional Deferral Period together with all such previous and further deferrals of interest payments shall not exceed ten (10) consecutive years at any one time or extend beyond the Stated Maturity Date of the Debentures of the Eighth Series. Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof. The Company will give the Trustee notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least ten (10) days and not more than sixty (60) days before the applicable Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will promptly forward notice of
such election to each Holder of record of the Debentures of the Eighth Series.

provided
,
however
, that, at the option of the Company, interest on this Security may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto, as such address shall appear on the Security Register or by a wire transfer to an account designated by the Person entitled thereto. The amount of interest payable on this Security will be computed on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months (and for any period shorter than a full quarterly period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30day calendar months).
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. (All capitalized terms used in this Security which are not defined herein, including the reverse hereof, but which are defined in the Indenture or in the Officers Certificate shall have the meanings specified in the Indenture or in the Officers Certificate.)

Guarantor
, which term includes any successor under the Indenture (the 
Indenture
) referred to in the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed), for value received, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Holder of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on such Security when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity Date, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such Security and of the Indenture regardless of any defense, right of setoff or counterclaim that the Guarantor may have (except the defense of payment). In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity Date or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company. The Guarantors obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by the Guarantor to the Holder of the Security or to a Paying Agent, or by causing the Company to pay such amount to such Holder or a Paying Agent.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its payment obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of such Security or the Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of such Security or the Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto (except that the Guarantor will have the benefit of any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company in accordance with the Indenture), by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor;

, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security, or increase the interest rate thereon (including Additional Interest, if any), or change any redemption provisions thereof (including any change to increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof) or change the Stated Maturity Date thereof.
The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or the Holder of such Security exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person, the filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Security except by complete performance of the payment obligations contained in such Security and in this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall constitute a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Guarantor hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Security, whether at the Stated Maturity Date, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Security, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, directly against the Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee without first proceeding against the Company.

The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of a Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee or the Indenture;
provided
,
however
, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all Securities issued under the Indenture which are then due and payable shall have been paid in full.
This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue notwithstanding any petition filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, the Company becoming insolvent or making an assignment for the benefit of creditors or a receiver or trustee being appointed for all or any significant part of the Companys property and assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Holder of such Security, whether as a voidable preference, fraudulent transfer, or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any such payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned on such Security, such Security shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed paid only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.
This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles thereunder, except to the extent that the law of any other jurisdiction shall be mandatorily applicable.

[FORM OF REVERSE OF SERIES H JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE
DUE JUNE 15, 2072]
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the 
Securities
), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture (For Unsecured Subordinated Debt Securities), dated as of September 1, 2006 (herein, together with any amendments thereto, called the 
Indenture
, which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), among the Company, NextEra Energy, Inc. (formerly known as FPL Group, Inc.) and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (herein called the 
Trustee
, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, including the Board Resolutions and Officers Certificate filed with the Trustee on June 15, 2012, creating the series designated on the face hereof (herein called the 
Officers Certificate
), for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
In addition to the option of the Company to redeem the Securities of this series in connection with a Tax Event or a Rating Agency Event described below, this Security shall also be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to the Stated Maturity Date, upon notice (the 
Redemption Notice
) mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the 
Redemption Date,
 at the applicable price (the 
Redemption Price
) described below. If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series at any time prior to June 15, 2017, the Redemption Price will equal the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof
plus
(ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date, and if applicable (as hereinafter described) a premium (the 
MakeWhole Premium
). In no event will the Redemption Price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
The amount of the MakeWhole Premium with respect to any Security of this series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
(1)    the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
(a)    each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring during the period from (and including) the Redemption Date to June 15, 2017 (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
(b)    the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the Stated Maturity Date of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed;
over
(2)    the principal amount of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed.
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (1) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 45 basis points.
The Company will appoint an independent investment banking institution of national standing to calculate the Make-Whole Premium when and as applicable;
provided
that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least thirty (30) days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, UBS Securities LLC or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee in consultation with, and at the expense of, the Company (in any such case, an 
Independent Investment Banker
).
For purposes of determining the MakeWhole Premium, 
Treasury Yield
 means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to June 15, 2017 of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the 
Remaining Term
). The Independent Investment Banker will determine the Treasury Yield as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
The Independent Investment Banker will determine the weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated H.15(519) Selected Interest Rates or any successor release (the 
H.15 Statistical Release
). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for the United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Independent Investment Banker will calculate the Treasury Yield by interpolation, on a straightline basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). The Independent Investment Banker will round any weekly average yields so calculated to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Independent Investment Banker will select comparable rates and calculate the Treasury Yield by reference to those rates.
If the Company redeems all or any part of the Securities of this series at any time on or after June 15, 2017, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date.
If at the time the Redemption Notice is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Redemption Date and such Redemption Notice shall be of no force or effect unless such moneys are received.
Upon payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
If before June 15, 2017 a Tax Event (as defined below) shall occur and be continuing, the Company shall have the right to redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, at any time within ninety (90) days following the occurrence of the Tax Event, upon a Redemption Notice, at 100% of the principal amount thereof
plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (the 
Tax Event Redemption Date

Before June 15, 2017, the Company shall have the right to redeem this Security in whole but not in part, upon a Redemption Notice given at any time within ninety (90) days after the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by the Company or the Guarantor following the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event (as defined below), at the price equal to the sum of (i) 102% of the principal amount thereof
plus
(ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (

Rating Agency Event
 means a change to the methodology or criteria that were employed by an applicable rating agency (as defined below) for purposes of assigning equity credit to securities such as the Securities of this series on the date of initial issuance of the Securities of this series (the 
current methodology
), which change either (i) shortens the period of time during which equity credit pertaining to the Securities of this series would have been in effect had the current methodology not been changed by the applicable rating agency, or (ii) reduces the amount of equity credit assigned to the
Securities of this series by the applicable rating agency as compared with the amount of equity credit that such rating agency had assigned to the Securities of this series as of the date of initial issuance thereof.
The term 
rating agency
 means any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and sometimes referred to in this Security as a rating agency), and the term 
applicable rating agency

If at the time a Redemption Notice is given, the redemption moneys are not on deposit with the Trustee, then the redemption shall be subject to their receipt on or before the Tax Event Redemption Date or Rating Agency Event Redemption Date, as the case may be, and such Redemption Notice shall be of no force or effect unless such moneys are received.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorneyinfact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, including the Officers Certificate described above.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture;
provided
however
, that the principal of and interest on the Securities of this series shall not be declared due and payable by reason of the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default specified in Section 801(c) of the Indenture applicable to the Securities of this series, and any notice of declaration of acceleration based on such Event of Default shall be null and void with respect to the Securities of this series. The Securities of this series will not be considered Outstanding for the purpose of determining whether the required vote described in Section 802 of the Indenture has been obtained for the declaration of acceleration by reason of the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default specified in Section 801(c) of the Indenture applicable to the Securities of this series.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected by such amendment to the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be thus affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by Holders of the specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of this series shall be conclusive and binding upon all current and future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
Pursuant to Section 312 of the Indenture, so long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of this series, to defer the payment of interest for a period not exceeding ten (10) consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an 
Optional Deferral Period
);
provided
that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity Date or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date. During the Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided for on the face hereof, as if the payment of interest had not been so deferred) will be compounded quarterly at the rate of 5.625% per annum. Any deferred interest on the Securities of this series will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the interest rate borne by the Securities of this series, to the extent permitted by applicable law. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid hereon, including Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, to the Person in whose name the Securities of this series are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended;
provided
that any such accrued and unpaid
interest payable at the Stated Maturity Date or any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. During any such Optional Deferral Period, neither the Guarantor nor the Company will, and each will cause their majorityowned subsidiaries not to (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on the Guarantors or the Companys capital stock, (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of the Guarantors or the Companys capital stock, (iii) pay any principal, interest or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of the Guarantors or the Companys debt securities that are equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities of this series or the Guarantee (as the case may be), or (iv) make any payments with respect to any Guarantor or Company guarantee of debt securities if such guarantee is equal or junior in right of payment to the Securities of this series or the Guarantee (as the case may be).
Subject to the reservation of right to amend
clause (f)
below, as described in paragraph 15 of the Officers Certificate, the foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Guarantor or the Company from making:
(a)
purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;
(b)
any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clauses (i) and (ii) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock;
(c)
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts;
(d)
dividends or distributions paid or made in its capital stock (or rights to acquire its capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock) and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts;
(e)
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future;
(f)
payments under any preferred trust securities guarantee or guarantee of subordinated debentures executed and delivered by the Guarantor concurrently with the issuance by a trust of any preferred trust securities, so long as the amount of payments made on any preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is paid on all preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be)
then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full distributions to which each series of preferred trust securities or subordinated debentures (as the case may be) is then entitled;
(g)
payments under any guarantee of junior subordinated debentures, which guarantee is executed and delivered by the Guarantor (including a Guarantee under the Indenture), so long as the amount of payments made on any junior subordinated debentures is paid on all junior subordinated debentures then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of junior subordinated debentures is then entitled;
(h)
dividends or distributions by the Company on its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor; or
(i)
redemptions, purchases, acquisitions or liquidation payments by the Company with respect to its capital stock to the extent owned by the Guarantor.
Prior to the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest,
provided
that such Optional Deferral Period together with all such previous and further deferrals of interest payments shall not exceed ten (10) consecutive years at any one time or extend beyond the Stated Maturity Date of the Securities of this series. Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least ten (10) days and not more than sixty (60) days before the applicable Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will promptly forward notice of such election to each holder of record of the Securities of this series.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor and of authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Each of the Company and the Guarantor has agreed, and by acceptance of this Security, the Holder will be deemed to have agreed, to treat this Security as indebtedness for United States federal tax purposes.
