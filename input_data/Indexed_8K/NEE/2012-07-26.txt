Exhibit 99
NextEra Energy announces second quarter earnings for 2012
JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2012 second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $607 million, or $1.45 per share, compared with $580 million, or $1.38 per share, in the second quarter of 2011. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's earnings were $527 million, or $1.26 per share, compared with $500 million, or $1.18 per share, in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, both of which primarily relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities.
NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the second quarter of 2012, said NextEra Energy President and CEO Jim Robo. At Florida Power & Light Company, earnings growth was driven by our record investments in the business, which will further enhance a customer value proposition that already delivers exceptional reliability and the lowest typical residential bill in the state. At NextEra Energy Resources, we are executing well on our largest-ever backlog of contracted renewables projects.
Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported second quarter net income of $353 million, or $0.85 per share, compared with $301 million, or $0.72 per share, in the prior-year's comparable quarter.
The main driver of FPL's growth was continued investment in the business, including investments in new, more efficient power generation. The company expects these investments will produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, enhanced reliability, and cleaner air. During the quarter, the company invested roughly $1.1 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion the company expects to invest in 2012.
1
Overall, underlying usage grew by 1.7 percent over the same quarter last year, the third consecutive increase. Since the second quarter of 2011, FPL's customer base grew by approximately 27,000, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly increase.
During the second quarter, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved FPL's license amendment request for the nuclear uprate programs at Turkey Point units 3 and 4 and at St. Lucie Unit 1. FPL expects these programs, along with the current program underway at St. Lucie Unit 2, to provide approximately 490 megawatts of additional zero-emission generation, while saving customers an estimated $3.8 billion in fossil fuel costs over the life of the projects.
FPL has submitted a base rate increase request with the Florida Public Service Commission. If granted, the base portion of the typical residential customer's bill is expected to increase by $7.09 per month, or roughly 23 cents per day, with a net total bill impact of $1.41 per month, or 5 cents per day. The quality of service hearings are scheduled to conclude on August 8 and the technical hearing is scheduled to begin August 20. The staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates are expected in the fourth quarter.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported second quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $251 million, or $0.60 per share, compared with $239 million, or $0.57 per share, in the prior-year's comparable quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings were $173 million, or $0.41 per share, compared with $159 million, or $0.37 per share, in the second quarter of 2011.
The increase in NextEra Energy Resources' adjusted earnings was primarily driven by contributions from new investments. Earnings from existing assets declined 9 cents versus the second quarter last year due in large part to less favorable wind resource when compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease was offset by the fact that last year's second quarter results were reduced by 8 cents from asset impairment charges.
Overall, the business remains on track to add approximately 1,300 megawatts of new U.S. wind assets to the portfolio in 2012 and approximately 600 megawatts of contracted Canadian wind between 2012 and 2015. The business also remains on track to add roughly 900 megawatts of contracted solar generation to the portfolio between 2012 and 2016.
Outlook
For 2012, NextEra Energy currently expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. It also continues to expect that adjusted earnings per share in 2014 will be in the range of $5.05 to $5.65.
NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no acquisitions or divestitures; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
