Grant of Performance Share Award.
The Company hereby grants to the Grantee a Performance Share Award (Award) which confers upon the Grantee the right to receive a number of shares (Performance Shares) of Stock, determined as set forth in section 2 hereof. The par value of the Performance Shares shall be deemed paid by the promise by the Grantee to perform future Service to the Company or an Affiliate. The Grantees right to receive the Performance Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan. The performance period for which the Award is granted is the period beginning on
[ ]

(such period hereinafter referred to as the Performance Period)
[
, and the Performance Shares will vest and become payable, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on [date]
]
.
The Target number of Performance Shares granted to the Grantee for the Performance Period is __________.
2.    
Payment of Performance Share Award
.
(a)    Payment of the Award shall be conditioned upon (i) the Companys achievement of the Code Section 162(m) corporate performance objective(s) established by the Committee for the Performance Period (the Section 162(m) Objective), (ii) certification by the Committee of (1) achievement of the Section 162(m) Objective for the Performance Period and (2) the Companys achievement of any secondary corporate performance objective(s) which were established by the Committee for the Performance Period for determining the percentage of the Target number of Performance Shares that actually may become vested under the Award (the Award Performance Objectives),

In no event will the Grantee vest in or have a right to payment of more than 200% of such Target number of Performance Shares. The Committee has the discretion to reduce the payout. If the Committee does not certify that the Section 162(m) Objective has been achieved for the Performance Period,
the Grantee will forfeit all, and will not vest in any, of the Performance Shares and, in such a case for purposes of this Agreement, the Achieved Percentage shall be 0%.

(2)    the other fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares (earned at the Deemed Performance Award Achievement level calculated as set forth in subsection (1), above) shall vest on the date after such Change of Control which is the earlier of (i) one year after the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if the Grantee is then providing Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate), or (ii) the date on which the Grantees Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate) terminates, and shall be payable (whether under clause (i) or clause (ii) of this section 2(b)(2)) as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event no later than the 15
th
day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the right to such payment arises).

The remainder of the Performance Shares shall remain outstanding (on a converted basis, if applicable) and shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. If the Grantee provides Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate) from the date of such Change in Control to the date of the first anniversary of such Change in Control or if, prior to the first anniversary of such Change in Control, the Grantee is involuntarily terminated other than for Cause or Disability, the fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Change in Control that did not vest at the time of such Change in Control shall vest on the date which is the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of such Change in Control or (b) the date on which the Grantees Service to the Company or an Affiliate (including to a successor to the Company or such Affiliate) terminates and shall be payable (whether under clause (a) or clause (b) of this section 2(c)) as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the right to such payment arises). The deemed level of achievement with respect to such awards shall be the Deemed Performance Award Achievement Level.
(d)    If, as a result of a Change of Control or a Change in Control, as applicable, shares of Stock are exchanged for or converted into a different form of equity security and/or the right to receive other property (including cash), payment in respect of the Performance Shares shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be made in the same form.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after termination of Service but prior to payment of the Award, the Grantee breaches any provision hereof, including without limitation the provisions of section 9 hereof, the Grantee shall immediately forfeit all rights to the Award.
(c)    If the Grantees termination of Service is due to retirement on or after age 50, and if, but only if, such retirement is evidenced by a writing which specifically acknowledges that this provision shall apply to such retirement and is executed by the Companys chief executive officer (or, if the Grantee is an executive officer, by a member of the Committee or the chief executive officer at the direction of the Committee, other than with respect to himself), the Grantees Target number of Performance Shares for the Performance Period shall be as set forth in section 1 hereof and the Grantees right to Performance Shares under section 2 hereof shall be determined as the Grantees Target number of Performance Shares times the Achieved Percentage. Payment of the Award under this section 4(c) shall be made after the end of the Performance Period at the time and in the manner specified in section 3 hereof.

Section 6.3

Such conditions may include, but not be limited to, a Change of Control, declaration and distribution of stock dividends or stock splits, mergers, consolidation or reorganizations, acquisitions or dispositions of material business units, or infrequently occurring or extraordinary gains or losses. In the event the Committee determines that, upon reexamination, alteration of the Corporate Performance Objectives is appropriate, the Committee shall reestablish the Corporate Performance Objectives to maintain as closely as possible the previously established expected level of overall performance of the Participants, taken as a whole, as is practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments to award opportunities or Corporate Performance Objectives applicable to a Section 162(m) Employee for a Plan Year shall conform to the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
Section 6.4    
Other Discretionary Adjustments

provided, however,
that in the case of Section 162(m) Employees, any such adjustment shall result in a reduced payment.
