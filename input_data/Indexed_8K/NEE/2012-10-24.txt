Exhibit 99
NextEra Energy announces third quarter earnings for 2012
JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2012 third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $415 million, or $0.98 per share, compared with $407 million, or $0.97 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's earnings were $532 million, or $1.26 per share, compared with $551 million, or $1.31 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments, and for 2011, the after tax loss on natural gas-fired generating assets held for sale, all of which primarily relate to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities.
NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
"NextEra Energy continued to execute well in the third quarter against our record capital investment program, said NextEra Energy President and CEO Jim Robo. At FPL, we expect our increased investments to further enhance a customer value proposition that delivers the lowest typical residential customer bill in the state, reliability that is among the best in the country and nationally recognized customer service. At NextEra Energy Resources, we expect to add approximately 1,500 megawatts (MW) of new U.S. wind generation this year as we continue work on a record backlog of contracted renewables projects.
Florida Power & Light
Company
NextEra Energy's principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported third quarter net income of $392 million, or $0.93 per share, compared with $347 million, or $0.83 per share, in the prior-year's comparable quarter.
1
The main driver of FPL's growth was continued investment in the business, including investments in new, more efficient power generation. The company expects these investments will produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, enhanced reliability, and cleaner air. During the quarter, the company invested roughly $900 million of the approximately $4.3 billion it expects to invest in 2012.
During the third quarter, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved FPL's license amendment request for the nuclear uprate program at St. Lucie Unit 2 and the company expects that uprate to be completed by year-end. Turkey Point Unit 4 will begin its uprate in the fourth quarter and is expected to complete it in the spring of 2013. Coupled with the completed uprates at both St. Lucie Unit 1 and Turkey Point Unit 3, these investments are now expected to provide at least an additional 526 MW of clean, emissions-free energy to customers.
Construction continued at both FPL's Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach modernization projects. At the end of the quarter, Cape Canaveral was on schedule and on budget with an expected in-service date of mid-2013. The Riviera Beach modernization project was on schedule and on budget with an expected in-service date of mid-2014. FPL's third modernization project, Port Everglades, also moved along through the development cycle and is expected to enter service in mid-2016
.
Some of FPL's customer metrics continued to improve in the third quarter. While total sales declined due to weather, overall underlying weather-adjusted usage grew by 1.6 percent over the same quarter last year, marking the fourth consecutive increase. Since the third quarter of 2011, FPL's customer base has grown by approximately 30,000, or 0.7%, marking the tenth consecutive quarter it has grown at roughly this rate.
Also in the quarter, FPL and three of the intervening parties in the company's rate case proceeding - the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association, and the Federal Executive Agencies - signed a proposed base rate settlement agreement that would help secure low rates for customers through the end of 2016, while supporting FPL's ability to provide safe, highly reliable service. The Office of Public Counsel has opposed the proposed settlement.
If approved, the settlement agreement would set FPL's allowed regulatory return on equity at 10.7 percent with a 100 basis point band and allow timely cost recovery for the company's investments in new, highly efficient power plants when they enter service. The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) has scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the proposed settlement agreement to begin Nov. 19 with a decision expected before the end of the year.
Whether the PSC ultimately renders a decision on the original base rate request filed in March, or on the proposed settlement agreement, FPL expects to continue to provide the lowest typical residential customer bill in Florida based on currently available data.
NextEra Energy Resources
NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $44 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with $67 million, or $0.16 per share, in the prior-year's comparable quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings were $162 million, or $0.38 per share, compared with $204 million, or $0.49 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.
Earnings in the year-ago period benefited from two factors that were not present in the third quarter of 2012. The gas-fired assets sold late last year contributed to results in the year-ago period and negatively impacted the comparison with the current quarter by 5 cents, and last year's third quarter included gains on the close-out of some hedges in the gas infrastructure area, which negatively impacted the comparison with this year's quarter by 8 cents.
2
Adjusting for these two effects, earnings at NextEra Energy Resources would have increased by approximately 2 cents compared to the third quarter of the prior year. New project additions contributed 5 cents compared to the year-ago period. In Texas, the aggregate impact of less extreme weather and more benign market conditions compared to the prior year quarter, as well as our customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, provided a positive net contribution of 9 cents.
These contributions were partially offset by the roll off of production tax credits (PTCs) for existing wind assets, which reduced earnings by 2 cents. Earnings were also reduced by lower generation and a refueling outage at the Seabrook Station nuclear facility, which negatively impacted results by 4 cents. All other effects, which include slight declines in other operating assets, slight increases in operations and maintenance and general and administrative expenses, and share dilution, reduced earnings by 6 cents.
During the quarter, the company reached an agreement to acquire a 165-MW wind project with a 20-year power purchase agreement that is expected to go into service by the end of the year. In addition, the company entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement for a new 100-MW wind project that is expected to go into service next year and is not contingent on the extension of the PTC. Additionally, the company received approval from the California Public Utility Commission for its 20-year power purchase agreement for the planned 250-MW McCoy solar project.
Overall, the business remains on track and within budget to add approximately 1,500 MW of new U.S. wind assets to the portfolio in 2012. The business also remains on track to add approximately 600 MW of Canadian wind between 2012 and 2015, and to add approximately 900 MW of contracted solar generation to the portfolio between 2012 and 2016.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other negatively impacted earnings by 5 cents, compared to a loss of 1 cent in the prior-year comparable quarter.
Outlook
For 2012, NextEra Energy continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. It also continues to expect that adjusted earnings per share in 2014 will be in the range of $5.05 to $5.65.
NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. In addition, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no acquisitions or divestitures; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
