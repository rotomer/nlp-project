SECTION 7 - REGULATION FD
Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
During the week of December 3, 2012, members of NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NextEra Energy) management team plan to discuss, at various investor meetings in New York, NY, among other topics, NextEra Energy's long-term growth expectations, including reaffirmation of its previously disclosed 2012 adjusted earnings per share expectations of $4.35 to $4.65 and 2014 adjusted earnings per share expectations of $5.05 to $5.65.  The adjusted earnings per share expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time.  In addition, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; no further significant decline in the national or the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no acquisitions or divestitures; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives.  NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations should be viewed in conjunction with NextEra Energy's cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below.  Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Cautionary Statements And Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NextEra Energy's and FPL's control. Forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K include, among others, statements concerning adjusted earnings per share expectations and future operating performance.
In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as will, will likely result, expect, anticipate, believe, intend, plan, seek, aim, potential, projection, forecast, predict, goals, target, outlook, should, would or similar words or expressions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance. The future results of NextEra Energy and FPL are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause their actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
