News Release NEWMONT 3Q 2002 Results The Gold Company Newmont Earns Net Income of $24 million and Generates $247 million in Operating Cash Flow in Third Quarter DENVER, November 12, 2002 - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) announced net income of $24 million ($0.06 per share) for the third quarter of 2002, compared to net income of $18.8 million ($0.10 per share) for the third quarter of 2001. For the first nine months, Newmont earned $86.8 million ($0.24 per share), compared to a net loss of $57.2 million ($0.29 per share) in 2001. Wayne W. Murdy, chairman and chief executive officer of Newmont, said, "This quarter's results are symbolic of how far this company has come in the past twelve months. For the quarter, we generated $24 million in net income and, more importantly, $247 million in operating cash flow. This strong operating performance allowed us to continue our debt reduction efforts, one of the key corporate objectives we outlined at the beginning of the year. In addition, with over 100 exploration drill rigs in the field and promising results to date, we are becoming increasingly confident of being able not only to replace reserves at year-end, but also to begin growing reserves again in 2003." Third quarter highlights included: o Sales of 2.1 million equity ounces of gold, on target; o Total cash costs of $189 per ounce, higher than expected. The increased cash costs are attributable to higher production costs in Nevada and a stronger Australian dollar; o Operating cash flow of $247 million, which represents 55% of the operating cash flow generated in the first three quarters; o Net debt reduction of $115 million, with a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 21% at the end of the quarter; o Cash and cash equivalents on hand of $292 million at the end of the quarter. In addition, the company has a portfolio of investments with a current market value of approximately $280 million; and o Hedge book reduction of 928,000 total ounces, which reduced committed ounces outstanding to 5.8 million ounces, roughly equivalent to ten months of production. As previously disclosed, PricewaterhouseCoopers was engaged to re-audit the 1999, 2000 and 2001 financial statements. The re-audit is now substantially complete. As a result of the re-audit, Newmont will be restating its financial statements to correct the accounting for a prepaid forward sales transaction, and certain depreciation calculations.

THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Third Quarter Net Income Increases 28% Net income was $24 million ($0.06 per share) in the third quarter compared with net income of $18.8 million ($0.10 per share) for the third quarter of 2001. Contributing to net income was $17.4 million in equity income of affiliates, including $13.5 million in equity income from Batu Hijau, and higher gold sales of $698 million at a realized price of $315 per equity ounce. These factors helped to offset increased total production costs of $255 per ounce and a non-cash, mark-to-market derivative loss of $11.2 million ($0.03 per share). For the first nine months, Newmont earned $86.8 million ($0.24 per share), compared to a net loss of $57.2 million ($0.29 per share) for the comparable period in 2001. Third Quarter Sales and Costs For the third quarter, gold sales increased from the year ago quarter at Newmont's Nevada and Yanacocha operations, in line with expectations. Improved grades and increased mining rates are expected to result in marginally higher production in the fourth quarter at these sites. The Nevada operations sold 722,000 ounces at total cash costs of $225 per ounce, which was 10% more ounces at 5% lower cash costs than for the third quarter of 2001. Total production costs decreased slightly to $282 per ounce. Increased sales were the result of 14% higher grade refractory ore as the operations moved 16% more tons from underground operations, in each case comparable to the 2001 period. For 2002, Nevada is expected to sell 2.67 million ounces of gold at total cash costs of $222 per ounce. At Yanacocha in Peru, the quarter's gold sales were 642,000 ounces (329,600 equity ounces) at total cash costs of $117 per equity ounce. This represents a 25% increase in ounces sold, but at $3 higher total cash costs compared to the third quarter of 2001. Total production costs were $184 per equity ounce as depreciation and amortization rose by 37% to $63 per ounce with the first full year of production from the La Quinua deposit. Yanacocha achieved a record mining rate of 588,000 tons per day in the third quarter, a 25% increase from a year ago. For 2002, Yanacocha is expected to sell 2.3 million ounces (1.2 million equity ounces) at total cash costs of $123 per equity ounce. The Australian gold operations sold 475,300 equity ounces at total cash costs of $201 per ounce. Total production costs were $274 per ounce, including $18 per ounce for depreciation costs for the step up in value of the acquired Normandy Mining Limited ("Normandy") assets. For 2002, the Australian operations are expected to sell 1.62 million equity ounces at total cash costs of $189 per ounce. Batu Hijau had another strong quarter with sales of 203.5 million pounds of copper (114.5 million equity pounds of copper) at net cash costs of $0.24 and total costs of $0.38 per pound, after by-product credits of 97,000 ounces of gold. Compared to the third quarter of 2001, this represented slightly higher copper sales at $0.05 lower cash costs and $0.04 lower total costs per pound. Batu Hijau continues to experience positive grade reconciliations and for 2002 is expected to sell between 350 million and 360 million pounds of copper at net cash costs of $0.36 per pound. Operating Cash Flows During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $247 million, more than double the 2001 period. For the year to date, cash flow from operations was $445 million, compared with $223 million for the 2001 period. Other Expenditures General and administrative costs were $29.7 million for the third quarter, and $78.7 million for the nine months. For the first nine months of 2002, capital expenditures totaled $238.2 million, including $97.4 million in the third quarter. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Debt Reduction Since the mid-February acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited ("Franco-Nevada"), Newmont has reduced its net debt to total capitalization ratio from approximately 40% to 21% at the end of September 2002. This is despite the revised accounting treatment for the prepaid forward sales transaction, which increased long-term debt by $145 million (with a corresponding reduction of $137.2 million in other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet). Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $292 million at the end of the third quarter, almost double from those a year ago. Non-core asset sales for the year to date total $221 million (including pre-acquisition sales by Franco-Nevada and Normandy). An additional $180 million ($90 million in cash and a note receivable of $90 million) is expected from the sale of the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture interest when the Kinross/TVX/Echo Bay merger closes. Subject to required shareholder NEWMONT 3Q 2002 RESULTS (NOVEMBER 12, 2002) Page 2 of 19
approvals, closing is now anticipated in late 2002 or early 2003. Hedge Book Reduction In line with the company's non-hedging philosophy, the Normandy group hedge book was reduced by 748,000 committed ounces and 180,000 uncommitted ounces during the quarter. The committed ounce reduction included scheduled deliveries of 478,000 ounces and the buy-back of 270,000 ounces at a cost of $13 million. At the end of the third quarter, the Normandy group hedge book was reduced to 5.8 million committed ounces of gold, but the mark-to-market valuation grew to a negative $412 million, primarily due to a higher gold price at the end of the third quarter. Through the acceleration of certain hedge contract deliveries and opportunistic buy-backs, the company expects a further reduction in the number of committed ounces of at least 279,000 in the fourth quarter of 2002. Newmont will continue to evaluate opportunities to deliver into, close out or simplify the Normandy group hedge book. Accounting Restatements and Changes Commenting on the status of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 re-audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mr. Hansen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said, "The re-audit is substantially complete. As previously disclosed, we corrected our accounting for a prepaid forward sales transaction entered into in July 1999. The cumulative, three-year impact of this change through June 30, 2002, was a $6.5 million reduction in earnings." In addition, as a result of the re-audit, Newmont will also be restating its previous three years of results to correct depreciation calculations at the equity accounted Batu Hijau operation, and at Yanacocha. The combined impact of these depreciation changes is a charge of $7.1 million through December 31, 2001. For the first three quarters of 2002 the depreciation changes reduced earnings by $2.4 million. Further, in order to conform to the currently preferred accounting methodology, the company has changed the way it calculates depreciation at underground operations and will record a positive, cumulative adjustment, net-of-tax, of $7.7 million for the years prior to 2002, and a positive adjustment of $0.4 million for the first three quarters of 2002 in regard to depreciation, primarily at the Nevada and Canadian underground operations. EXPLORATION Exploration and research expenditures totaled $25.4 million and $55.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2002, respectively, compared to $12.8 million and $43.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001. Currently, over 100 drills are operating worldwide on approximately 30 projects. The high level of activity is producing positive results in Nevada (Gold Margin area between Deep Post and Deep Star, Emigrant Springs and Dos Equis), Yanacocha (Corimayo and Chaquicocha Sur), Australia (Jundee Westside and Golden Grove), and Ghana (Akim). Based on results to date, Newmont expects to replace reserves net of depletion at year-end. Updated reserves are scheduled to be announced with year-end 2002 financial results in the first quarter of 2003. In Nevada, underground drilling continues to test the Gold Margin mineralized area, which may connect to South Deep Post, and has recorded several ore zones in the 0.5 to 1.0 ounce per ton range. Core drilling of the southern margin of the Gold Quarry pit (Dos Equis area) is showing grade increases of 10% to 40% compared to old rotary mud holes. Recent drilling has also increased the mineralized zone of Emigrant Springs, south of Carlin. Drilling at Akim in Ghana shows continuity of the ore deposit to almost 1,000 feet at depth over a strike length of 0.8 mile, suggesting that in combination with ongoing feasibility study work, a reserve could be defined in the future. The company believes that Ghana has the potential to become a district play for Newmont. The Corimayo oxide deposit at Yanacocha has been extended laterally with further high-grade intersections. Broader spaced drilling suggests that further oxide mineralization could be present in the area. The Jundee Westside zone in Western Australia has produced many new high-grade drill core intersections with visible gold. Reserve calculations for the upper panel are in progress. At Batu Hijau, a deep drilling program is augmenting an on-going, in-fill drilling effort. Lower operating costs combined with improving geotechnical conditions, positive model reconciliations and the current drilling program suggest a possible increase in Batu Hijau's copper and gold reserves at year-end, despite lowering the copper price to calculate reserves from $1.00 to $0.75 per pound. NEWMONT 3Q 2002 RESULTS (NOVEMBER 12, 2002) Page 3 of 19
The details of the updated 2002 forecast are included on pages 6. In summary, the company expects the following for 2002: o Sales of 7.5 million equity ounces of gold; o Total cash costs of approximately $185 per equity ounce; o Earnings per share, before mark-to-market adjustments, at the lower end of previous guidance of $0.40 to $0.50, assuming current gold prices; o Net debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 20%; and o Replacement of reserves, net of depletion. For 2002, cash flow from operations is expected to be between $650 million and $680 million, assuming current gold prices, versus earlier guidance of $750 million. The revised target reflects changes in assumptions and accounting treatment of deferred mining costs, the minority interest in a larger than budgeted dividend at Yanacocha, and management's decision to use cash to accelerate the reduction of the Normandy group hedge book. The preliminary 2003 forecast is as follows: o Sales of 7.0 million to 7.2 million equity ounces of gold, assuming the sale/exchange of TVX Newmont Americas/Echo Bay; and o Total cash costs of between $180 and $192 per ounce.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Gold Ounces Sold Increase 50% Gold sales for the third quarter increased 50% over the prior year to 2.1 million equity ounces and 13% over the second quarter of 2002. The North American operations contributed 836,400 equity ounces, the Australian operations contributed 475,300 equity ounces and Yanacocha contributed 329,600 equity ounces. Newmont sold its gold in the third quarter at an average realized price of $315 per equity ounce, $41 higher than the third quarter of 2001. North America The Nevada operations, including the recently acquired Midas operation, continue to be Newmont's largest gold producing district, contributing 722,000 ounces, 35% of total gold sales in the third quarter of 2002. This is a 21% increase over the second quarter of 2002 and a 10% increase over the year ago quarter. The increase in sales is attributable to 14% higher grade refractory ore compared to a year ago. Total cash costs improved 5% over the year ago quarter to $225 per ounce. For the same period, total production costs improved slightly to $282 per ounce. In the third quarter, the contribution of sales from refractory ore sources increased significantly. For 2002, Nevada's forecasted gold sales are 2.67 million ounces at total cash costs of $222 per ounce. The Golden Giant underground mine sold 60,400 ounces at total cash costs of $217 per ounce, compared to 72,600 ounces at $202 cash costs per ounce a year ago. The decline in ounces sold and the higher costs are attributable to mining of lower grade stopes during the quarter. Higher grades and increased production is expected in the fourth quarter, which should allow Golden Giant to sell 300,000 ounces for the year at a total cash cost of $184 per ounce. The Holloway underground mine sold 20,000 equity ounces in the third quarter at total cash costs of $161 per ounce, compared to 20,500 equity ounces at $216 per ounce in the year ago quarter. For 2002, Holloway is expected to sell 95,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $200 per ounce. The Mesquite mine sold 16,300 ounces at total cash costs of $214 per ounce from residual heap leaching in the third quarter. For 2002, Mesquite is expected to sell 50,000 ounces at total cash costs of $170 per ounce. La Herradura sold 17,600 equity ounces at total cash costs of $169 per ounce in the third quarter. For 2002, La Herradura is expected to sell 65,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $175 per ounce. South America For the third quarter, the South American operations sold 394,500 equity ounces at total cash costs of $123 per ounce, 16% more ounces at $6 higher cash costs than the 2001 quarter. Yanacocha sold 329,600 equity ounces at total cash costs of $117 per ounce, 25% higher sales at similar cash costs from the year ago quarter. Higher gold sales were the result of increased tons placed on the leach pads, augmented by the La Quinua crushing and agglomeration facility operating at design rates. For 2002, Yanacocha is expected to sell 2.3 million ounces (1.2 million equity ounces) at total cash costs of $123 per ounce. Kori Kollo sold 64,900 equity ounces at total cash costs of $152 per ounce, compared to 76,900 equity ounces at $127 per ounce in the year ago quarter. For 2002, Kori Kollo is expected to sell 250,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $155 per ounce. Australia The Australian operations sold 475,300 equity ounces in the third quarter at total cash costs of $201 per ounce, compared to 458,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $196 per ounce in the second quarter of 2002. Kalgoorlie sold 94,600 equity ounces at total cash costs of $224 per ounce in the third quarter. Higher costs were attributable to the unbudgeted continuation of underground operations at Mount Charlotte and higher unit mining and processing costs. Pajingo sold 77,200 ounces at total cash costs of $98 per ounce, compared to 29,600 equity ounces at $128 per ounce for the year ago quarter. Effective February 15, 2002, Newmont increased its ownership interest in Pajingo from 50% to 100%. Production was impacted by a temporary substitution of low grade stockpile feed for the mill in place of higher grade underground ores. The Tanami operations sold 133,400 equity ounces at total cash costs of $206 per ounce. The higher costs at Tanami are attributable to the processing of harder ores and accelerated underground development costs at the Callie deposit. The Yandal operations under-performed during the quarter. Sales were 170,100 ounces at total cash costs of $231 per ounce. The Yandal operations comprise Jundee, Bronzewing and Wiluna. NEWMONT 3Q 2002 RESULTS (NOVEMBER 12, 2002) Page 11 of 19
At Jundee, 73,100 ounces were sold at total cash costs of $205 per ounce. Lower than modeled stockpile grades were encountered and unbudgeted costs were incurred in the completion of open pit mining. At Bronzewing, 67,400 ounces were sold at total cash costs of $243 per ounce. Production was adversely impacted by a change in stope sequencing which resulted in lower grade stopes being accessed in the third quarter, in addition to a number of one-off costs incurred with the transition to owner mining. At Wiluna, 29,600 ounces were sold at total cash costs of $269 per ounce. Wiluna's performance suffered from a delay in the start up of the BIOX tailings treatment plant. For 2002, the Australian operations are expected to sell 1.62 million equity ounces at total cash costs of $189 per ounce. Other Overseas Operations For the third quarter, Newmont's other overseas operations contributed sales of 162,900 equity ounces at total cash costs of $149 per ounce, compared to 140,900 equity ounces at total cash costs of $146 per ounce in the year ago quarter. The Zarafshan operation in Uzbekistan turned in a solid third quarter, selling 70,300 equity ounces at total cash costs of $122 per ounce. This represents a 13% improvement in sales and a $7 decrease in cash costs compared to the year ago quarter. For 2002, Zarafshan is expected to sell 250,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $133 per ounce. The Martha mine in New Zealand sold 27,700 equity ounces at total cash costs of $138 per ounce. For 2002, Martha is expected to sell 105,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $124 per ounce. The Ovacik mine in Turkey sold 36,600 equity ounces at total cash costs of $123 per ounce. For 2002, Ovacik is expected to sell 120,000 ounces at total cash costs of $138 per ounce. The Minahasa mine in Indonesia sold 28,300 equity ounces at total cash costs of $259 per ounce. For 2002, Minahasa is expected to sell 140,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $215 per ounce. Equity Investments Equity investments include Batu Hijau, the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture, Echo Bay, Australian Magnesium Corporation and Australian Gold Refinery, and are reported under "equity income of affiliates" in the income statement. For the third quarter, these entities contributed $17.5 million in earnings to Newmont. Batu Hijau accounted for $13.5 million; TVX Newmont Americas, $3.5 million; Echo Bay, $1.1 million and the two Australian entities had a combined net loss of approximately $300,000. In the third quarter of 2002, the equity investments contributed 217,700 equity ounces of gold sales, comprising 96,900 ounces from Batu Hijau, 54,400 ounces from TVX Newmont Americas and 66,400 ounces from Echo Bay. Base Metals Batu Hijau had a strong quarter, selling 203.5 million pounds of copper (114.5 million equity pounds) at a record net cash cost of $0.24 per pound, compared to 199.1 million pounds (112.0 million equity pounds) at $0.29 per pound a year ago. The average realized price per pound was $0.62. Lower cash costs were the result of increased mill throughput and higher average ore grades. In the third quarter, ore grades averaged 0.85% copper (compared to 0.80% copper for the 2001 third quarter) due to accelerated mining in the deeper portions of the ore body. The copper grade is expected to decrease in the fourth quarter. For 2002, Batu Hijau is expected to sell between 350 and 360 million pounds of copper at a net cash cost of $0.36 per pound. The Golden Grove zinc and copper mine in Western Australia sold 43.5 million pounds of zinc and 12.6 million pounds of copper in the third quarter of 2002. Zinc cash costs in the third quarter were $0.21 per pound while copper cash costs were $0.55 per pound. Zinc was sold at $0.33 per pound and copper at $0.75 per pound. For 2002, Golden Grove is expected to sell 100 million pounds of zinc at a cash cost of $0.28 per pound, and to sell 40 million to 45 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $0.60 per pound.
