News Release Q4 AND 2002 Results NEWMONT The Gold Company Full Year Net Income of $154 million, $0.42 per share; Fourth Quarter Net Income Triples DENVER, March 28, 2003 - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced 2002 net income applicable to common shares of $154.3 million ($0.42 per share), compared to a net loss of $54.1 million ($0.28 per share) in 2001. For the fourth quarter of 2002, Newmont earned $75.1 million ($0.19 per share), compared to net income of $18.4 million ($0.10 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2001. Performance highlights for 2002 included: o Equity gold sales of 7.6 million ounces at total cash costs of $189 per ounce (1); o Net cash provided by operating activities of $670.3 million; o Net debt to total capitalization ratio reduced by more than half to 20%; and o Excellent exploration results, replacing depletion of more than nine million ounces, resulting in year-end proven and probable gold reserves of 86.9 million equity ounces. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Newmont, said: "With higher realized gold prices, we generated strong earnings growth with net income of $154 million and operating cash flow of $670 million. With continued strength in the gold market, 2003 should be another exciting year for the company with strong bottom-line earnings growth." 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce (a non-GAAP measure of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Q4 AND 2002 RESULTS (MARCH 28, 2003) Page 1 of 25
NEWMONT 2002 and Fourth Quarter Results Net income applicable to common shares was $154.3 million ($0.42 per share) for 2002, a substantial improvement over a net loss of $54.1 million ($0.28 per share) in 2001. Net income for 2002 before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $146.6 million ($0.39 per share). The company's improved performance in 2002 was the result of higher gold sales, a $42 per ounce higher realized gold price, a 128% increase in equity income of affiliates (primarily from Batu Hijau) to $51.4 million, and pre-tax royalty revenue of $35.7 million, offsetting higher costs and expenses. The results of the acquired Normandy and Franco-Nevada operations have been included in Newmont's results of operations from February 16, 2002 forward. The company generated strong operating cash flow of $670.3 million and $225.2 million for the year and quarter, respectively. Operating cash flows and the proceeds from non-core asset sales enabled the company to fund $300 million in capital expenditures and to reduce net borrowings by $547 million. For 2002, total cash costs were $189 an ounce, an increase of 3% from 2001. Higher cash costs were primarily driven by lower ore grades at some operations, an appreciating Australian dollar and higher fuel prices. Operating income totaled $256.1 million for 2002 versus an operating loss of $64.8 million for 2001. Operating income was impacted by higher than planned exploration and general and administrative costs, partially related to integration costs, as well as a $48.1 million write-down of assets. Of the asset write-downs, $36.2 million was related to the reduction of inventories to the lower of average cost or net realizable value as a result of a change in accounting policy to include depreciation in inventory. For 2002, the company incurred a non-cash loss on derivative instruments, primarily attributable to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books, of $39.8 million ($0.11 per share) before tax. For the fourth quarter of 2002, the company earned net income applicable to common shares of $75.1 million ($0.19 per share), up 308% from the comparable quarter of 2001. A 57% increase in equity gold ounces sold at a higher realized price of $328 an ounce and $12.8 million in royalty revenue resulted in a 79% increase in sales and other income versus the year ago quarter. Operating income was $99.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to an operating loss of $15.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. During the quarter, the company incurred a non-cash loss on derivative instruments, primarily attributable to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books, of $25.4 million ($0.06 per share) before tax. Further, the company recorded a tax benefit of $21.9 million during the quarter as it recognized additional depletion benefits and resolved tax issues associated with prior years. Operating Highlights North America 2002 Q4 2002 Q4 2001 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 3,224 932 855 Total cash costs ($/oz) (1) $220 $199 $213 o For the year, the Nevada operations sold 2.7 million ounces at a total cash cost of $225 an ounce, both marginally higher compared to 2001. o During the quarter, the Nevada operations sold 796,000 equity ounces, an 11% increase over the fourth quarter of 2001. Production from refractory ores increased to 568,000 ounces (+27%) due to a combination of higher-grade ore milled and improved recovery. Total cash costs declined 9% from a year ago. South America 2002 Q4 2002 Q4 2001 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 1,426 411 337 Total cash costs ($/oz) (1) $131 $119 $121 o For the year, Yanacocha sold 1.18 million equity ounces at a total cash cost of $125 an ounce. Higher costs over 2001 were mainly attributable to lower grade ore. Gold sold increased by 20% as lower grades were more than offset by increased tons placed on the leach pads. o Yanacocha sold 354,000 equity ounces during the quarter, a 34% increase over the fourth quarter of Q4 AND 2002 RESULTS (MARCH 28, 2003) Page 2 of 25
NEWMONT 2001. Total cash costs for the quarter were 3% lower at $112 an ounce. Australia 2002 Q4 2002 Q4 2001 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 1,685 513 35 Total cash costs ($/oz) (1) $191 $190 $96 o The Australian operations were part of the Normandy acquisition on February 15, 2002, reflecting 10.5 months of results for 2002, except for Pajingo, which had been 50% owned by Newmont and became wholly owned with the Normandy acquisition. This 10.5-month time frame is referred to as the "relevant period." o Pajingo was the outstanding performer in 2002, selling 296,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $95 an ounce. Pajingo is the company's lowest cost gold producer. o Tanami sold 452,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $205 an ounce in the relevant period. Higher cash costs were due to increased royalty payments, higher processing costs due to harder than expected ores at Groundrush and higher than expected mining costs at Callie. o Yandal sold 611,000 ounces at a total cash cost of $215 an ounce in the relevant period. Overall, higher than expected sales were offset by higher than forecast total cash costs, partially attributable to Bronzewing due to the one-off transition cost of the change from contractor to owner-mining during 2002. o Kalgoorlie sold 325,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $215 an ounce in the relevant period. A joint venture committee is evaluating alternatives to improve operating efficiencies and recommendations are expected by June 2003. Batu Hijau (Indonesia) 2002 Q4 2002 Q4 2001 Equity copper sales (million lbs.) 362 91 77 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 278 78 60 Net cash costs ($/lb Cu) (1) $0.31 $0.30 $0.42 o Batu Hijau had another impressive year and continues to exceed expectations. Batu Hijau is now one of the world's lowest net cash cost copper producers. o For 2002, copper sales were marginally higher (+1%) than the prior year, as lower grades were off-set by higher throughput. Copper recovery was unchanged at 89%. Net cash costs (net of by-product credits) were $0.31 a pound, a reduction of 16% from 2001. o For the quarter, copper sales were up 17% and gold sales were up 30% as higher grades and recovery rates more than offset marginally lower throughput rates. Other Operations 2002 Q4 2002 Q4 2001 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 637 170 126 Total cash costs ($/oz) (1) $155 $166 $157 o At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, 256,000 equity ounces were sold in 2002, 15% more than 2001, as the average ore grade improved. Total cash costs were marginally lower at $134 an ounce. For the quarter, sales and total cash costs were similar to the prior year period. o At Ovacik in Turkey, a former Normandy mine, 126,000 ounces were sold at a total cash cost of $122 an ounce in the relevant period. This was the first full year of operations at Ovacik. o At Martha in New Zealand, a former Normandy mine, 108,000 equity ounces were sold at a total cash cost of $156 an ounce in the relevant period. Sales were as expected, but ground subsidence issues adversely impacted costs. o At Minahasa in Indonesia, 147,000 equity ounces were sold at a total cash cost of $218 an ounce, both essentially as expected. The operation has ceased mining but production continues from the processing of lower grade stockpiles. o At the Golden Grove zinc-copper mine, a former Normandy mine, 148 million pounds of zinc and 45.7 million pounds of copper were sold at cash costs per pound of $0.18 and $0.56, respectively, in Q4 AND 2002 RESULTS (MARCH 28, 2003) Page 3 of 25
NEWMONT the relevant period. The mine's results were better than expected for both metal sales and costs. The mine also sold 13,600 ounces of gold. 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce (a non-GAAP measure of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Financial Highlights - 2002 Debt Reduction During 2002, Newmont reduced its net debt to total capitalization ratio from approximately 42% to 20% as it made net debt repayments of $547 million. The company continues to strengthen its balance sheet and has a long-term target of approximately 10% net debt to total capitalization. Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents totaled $401.7 million at the end of 2002, an increase of 169% from a year ago. Non-core asset sales totaled $241 million for the year (including pre-acquisition sales initiated by Franco-Nevada and Normandy). An additional $180 million was received on January 31, 2003, from the sale of the company's TVX-Newmont Americas joint venture interest. Australian Gold Hedge Books In line with the company's no-hedging philosophy, the Australian gold hedge books were reduced by 434,000 committed ounces and 105,000 uncommitted ounces during the fourth quarter. At year-end 2002, the acquired Australian gold hedge books stood at 5.15 million committed ounces and 1.5 million uncommitted ounces, with a negative mark-to-market valuation of $433 million. Approximately 67% of the negative mark-to-market valuation relates to the Yandal Operations hedge book, which is non-recourse to Newmont. Minimum scheduled deliveries for 2003 are in excess of 1.1 million committed ounces. As of March 26, 2003, the company had repurchased 804,000 committed ounces and delivered 449,000 committed ounces for the year, reducing its committed hedge position to 3.9 million ounces. Newmont will continue to evaluate opportunities to further deliver into, close out and simplify these gold hedge books. ACCOUNTING As requested by Newmont, PricewaterhouseCoopers has completed its reaudit of the company's 1999 through 2001 financial statements. As a result of the re-audit, certain corrections were required to the previously reported financial statements. In addition to the previously announced restatements for a prepaid forward gold sales contract and changes in depreciation calculations, the company is changing its deferred stripping calculations at the Batu Hijau operation to exclude in-pit, non-reserve material and is changing its inventory accounting policy to include depreciation in inventory. The net cumulative impact of the restatements was an increase in stockholders' equity at December 31, 2001 of $19.7 million. (Refer to page 10 - Supplemental Information - for further details of these restatements.) As a result of the restatements, the company will also be restating its previously reported 2002 and 2001 quarterly financial results. These restatements had a nominal impact on 2002 net income. As previously reported, in order to conform to the currently preferred accounting methodology, the company changed the way it calculates depreciation at underground mining operations and recorded a positive, cumulative adjustment, net of tax, of $7.7 million ($0.02 per share) effective January 1, 2002. In a previous news release issued by the company on February 24, 2003, the company stated that it had requested the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) concurrence with the company's allocation of the purchase price related to the 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada and with the company's methodology for future testing for impairment of goodwill. Although the company provided and discussed such purchase price allocation and methodology with the SEC, its review does not constitute its approval or concurrence therewith. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair market values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and other identifiable intangibles not subject to amortization will be reviewed for possible impairment at least annually. Q4 AND 2002 RESULTS (MARCH 28, 2003) Page 4 of 25
NEWMONT DIVIDEND INCREASE On January 29, 2003, the Board of Directors approved a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.04 per share. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "With the integration of our recent three-way merger complete and the positive outlook for the gold price, the Board felt it appropriate to reward shareholders for their patience by increasing the dividend immediately. We will continue to evaluate our dividend policy going forward." Exploration & Reserve Update Exploration and research expenditures totaled $88.9 million and $33.2 million for the year and fourth quarter, respectively. Commenting on the exploration results, Newmont's President Pierre Lassonde said: "For 2002, we made reserve replacement a company-wide responsibility and the results speak for themselves. Through the collective skills of our operating and exploration employees, our proprietary technology and unparalleled land position in some of the world's best gold districts, we were able to replace depletion of more than nine million ounces. The positive momentum is being maintained and our objective is to increase reserves in 2003." As reported in the company's February 24, 2003 news release, year-end gold reserves were 86.9 million ounces, at a $300 gold price assumption. Reported reserves include 3.7 million ounces from the company's equity interests in the TVX-Newmont Americas joint venture, which was sold effective January 31, 2003, and in Echo Bay, which was converted into a 13.8% equity interest in Kinross Gold on the same date. Excluding the 3.7 million ounces, year-end reserves of 83.2 million ounces were essentially unchanged from 2001 pro-forma reserves. Reserves were added at all four core operating regions, as well as at the greenfields Akyem project in Ghana. Highlights include: o In Nevada, the Carlin Trend operations replaced depletion for the first time since 1996; o At Minera Yanacocha in Peru, the Corimayo deposit was brought into reserves; o In Australia, reserves were replaced as the high-grade Westside discovery at Jundee was brought into reserves; o At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper and gold reserves increased by approximately 13 percent, despite using a lower long-term copper price assumption of $0.75 per pound; and o At Akyem in Ghana, 1.6 million equity ounces were brought into reserves.

7. Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound The total cash costs per ounce or pound is a non-GAAP performance measure that is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
