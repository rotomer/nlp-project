Exchange Rate Data
 
Selected exchange rate data is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(b)    
Pro Forma Financial Information.
 
 
 
On February 16, 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Franco-Nevada pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement. On February 20, 2002, Newmont gained control of Normandy through an off-market bid for all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Normandy. On February 26, 2002, when Newmont's off-market bid for Normandy expired, Newmont had a relevant interest in more than 96% of Normandy's outstanding shares. Newmont exercised its rights to acquire the remaining shares of Normandy in April 2002. Based on these events, we have prepared the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information assuming that Newmont has acquired 100% of both Normandy and Franco-Nevada.
 
The following unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared to assist you in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada (the "Transaction"). We derived this information for each of the respective companies as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The information prepared is only a summary and you should read it in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes contained in the annual reports and other information that Newmont, Normandy and Franco-Nevada have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Australian Stock Exchange Limited and various securities commissions and similar authorities in Canada, respectively. Certain of this information has been filed as exhibits to this report.
 
 
Several factors should be considered when comparing the historical financial information of Newmont, Normandy and Franco-Nevada to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the Transaction occurred in the past or the future financial results that the combined company will achieve after the Transaction.
 
The purchase price allocation contained herein is preliminary. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2002 following the completion of an independent appraisal. The final purchase price allocation was determined based on the actual fair values of current assets, current liabilities, indebtedness, reclamation and remediation liabilities, derivative instruments, marketable securities, property, plant and mine development, mineral and royalty interests acquired and other identifiable intangible assets, with the excess of purchase price over the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets allocated to goodwill.
 
 
 
The following pro forma financial statements are estimates of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information of Newmont as of December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended, assuming the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1Basis of Presentation
 
The Pro Forma presentation reflects the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada as purchases for accounting purposes. Newmont has issued approximately 86.8 million common shares to stockholders of Normandy and approximately 110.6 million common shares (including exchangeable shares of a subsidiary that are exchangeable at any time into Newmont common shares on a one-for-one basis) to the stockholders of Franco-Nevada. For accounting purposes only, the shares issued to Normandy stockholders include the Newmont shares applicable to the 19.8% of Normandy held by Franco-Nevada. The shares issued to Franco-Nevada stockholders exclude the Newmont shares applicable to its 19.8% holding in Normandy.
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet gives effect to the 100% acquisitions of Normandy and of Franco-Nevada as of December 31, 2001. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes historical revenues and expenses of Newmont, Normandy and Franco-Nevada for that year, adjusted to US GAAP.
 
Normandy's fiscal year ends on June 30 and Franco-Nevada's fiscal year ends on March 31. Newmont's fiscal year ends on December 31. The combined company will utilize December 31 as its fiscal year end.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet and the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Operations do not include all information and notes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements.
 
Normandy's effective interest in Australian Magnesium Corporation Limited ("AMC") was diluted from 62.6% to 22.8% prior to Newmont's acquisition of Normandy. Consequently, AMC had been deconsolidated from November 23, 2001 and has been accounted for as a equity investment from that date. See Note 6 to the unaudited financial statements of Normandy at December 31, 2001 and 2000 and for the two six-month periods then ended, filed as Exhibit 20.5 to this report.
 
Note 2US GAAP adjustments to Normandy
 
The consolidated financial statements of Normandy have been prepared in accordance with Australian GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from US GAAP. Normandy's restated, audited financial statements at June 30, 2001 and 2000, and for the three-year period then ended, and Normandy's restated, unaudited financial statements at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and for the two six-month periods then ended, have been filed as Exhibits 20.4 and 20.5, respectively, to this report. Please refer to Notes 40 and 8 of those financial statements, respectively, for reconciliations from Australian GAAP to US GAAP and descriptions of the significant differences and reconciling items.
 
The following notes set out a summarized description of the basis on which the Normandy Australian GAAP financial statements were adjusted to approximate US GAAP. In addition, some items have been reclassified to conform the presentation to that of Newmont.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 3Pro Forma Adjustments to Record the acquisition of 100% of Normandy
 
The following adjustments have been made to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet and the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Operations at December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended:
 
 
The following table reflects the estimated purchase accounting allocation for the acquisition of Normandy:
 
 
 
The closing market price of Newmont's common stock on January 2, 2002, the last trading day before the revised terms of the Transaction were announced, was $19.09. The cost of the acquisition reflects the average of that price and the closing prices of Newmont's common stock for the two days preceding and the two days following announcement, for which the average was $19.01 per share.
 
The entry to record the purchase transaction gives rise to a deferred tax liability based on changes in the book bases of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed. There were no corresponding increases in the tax bases of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets and liabilities assumed as this transaction was structured as a tax-free exchange. No deferred tax liability has been established for the goodwill for which amortization is not deductible for tax purposes.
 
 
The pro forma combined stockholders' equity of Newmont reflects the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 4US GAAP Adjustments to Franco-Nevada
 
The consolidated financial statements of Franco-Nevada have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from US GAAP. Franco-Nevada's audited financial statements at March 31, 2001, and for the three-year period then ended, and Franco-Nevada's unaudited financial statements at September 30, 2001, and for the two six-month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, have been filed as Exhibit 20.3 to this report. Certain,disclosures presented with Franco-Nevada's financial information have been modified from those previously presented. Refer to Note 14 of those financial statements for reconciliations from Canadian GAAP to US GAAP and detailed descriptions of the significant differences and reconciling items.
 
The following notes provide a summarized description of the basis on which Franco-Nevada's Canadian GAAP financial statements were adjusted to US GAAP. In addition, some items have been reclassified to conform the presentation to that of Newmont.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 5Pro Forma Adjustments to Record the acquisition of 100% of Franco-Nevada
 
The following adjustments have been made to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet and the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Operations at December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The closing market price of Newmont's common stock on January 2, 2002, the last trading day before the revised terms of the Transaction were announced, was $19.09. The cost of the acquisition reflects the average of that price and the closing prices of Newmont's common stock for the two days preceding and the two days following announcement, for which the average was $19.01 per share.
 
The entry to record the purchase transaction gives rise to a deferred tax liability based on changes in the book bases of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed. There were no corresponding increases in the tax bases of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed as this transaction was structured as a tax-free exchange. No deferred tax liability has been established for the goodwill for which amortization is not deductible for tax purposes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 6Cost Savings and Expenses of the Acquisitions
 
Expected annual cost savings estimated to be approximately $70 million after tax during the first full year of combined operations have not been reflected as an adjustment to the historical data because such data constitutes estimates of what savings may be achieved after the three companies are combined. Likewise, estimated future costs associated with closing the acquisitions have not been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Operations, nor have expenses recorded by Normandy related to its evaluation of strategic alternatives been eliminated.
 
Estimated costs of the Transaction total approximately US$60 million for Normandy and US$30 million for Franco-Nevada, consisting primarily of investment bankers fees and related expenses, legal, accounting and other professional advisor fees related directly related to the acquisitions. These costs have been capitalized as direct costs associated with the Transaction.

Exhibit 20.3
 
 
To the Directors of
Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of as at March 31, 2001 and 2000 and the consolidated statements of earnings, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Canada and the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
 
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2001 and 2000 and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2001 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Comments by Auditors for United States Readers on Canadian  United States Reporting Differences
 
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of an explanatory paragraph, following the opinion paragraph, when there is a change in accounting principles that has a material effect on the comparability of the Company's consolidated financial statements, such as the change described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Our report to the Directors dated April 30, 2001 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards which do not require a reference to such a change in accounting principles in the Auditors' Report when the change is properly accounted for and adequately disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

1.    Accounting Policies
 
The consolidated financial statements of Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. Summarized below are the significant accounting policies used in these consolidated financial statements.
 
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in Canada. Certain information included in the Annual Financial Statements are not included herein. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation have been included in these financial statements. Operating results for the period ended September 30, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal period ended December 31, 2001 (see note 12).
 
(a)  Basis of consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
 
(b)  Use of estimates
 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The most significant estimates and assumptions are related to taxes and the recoverability of resource property costs through future production. Actual results could be different from these estimates.
 
(c)  Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
 
Cash and cash equivalents include highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than 90 days. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates their fair value. The Company's short-term investments include highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of 90 days or more and are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value.
 
(d)  Precious metals and inventories
 
Precious metals inventory is valued at the period end spot price. Mine operating supplies are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value.
 
(e)  Investments in marketable securities
 
Investments in marketable securities are valued at cost until it is determined that a permanent impairment exists at which time a write-down is taken.
 
(f)  Resource properties
 
Mineral property and development costs
 
The Company records its interests in mineral properties at cost. Producing properties are amortized using the units-of-production method. For working interests, all investments in development and mineral rights are amortized over the proven and probable reserves of each property. Net Smelter Return Royalties and Net Profit Interests generally
 
 
 
comprise a one-time acquisition cost. The cost is amortized over the proven and probable reserves as provided to the Company by the property operator. The ultimate recovery of costs associated with non-producing properties is dependent upon the discovery and development of economic reserves or the profitable sale of the properties. If a property is abandoned or sold, the proceeds on the sale, less the cost of the property and any related deferred expenditures, are included in operations at that time. The Company periodically reviews its mineral properties to ascertain whether an impairment in value has occurred. Where a property is considered uneconomic it is written off.
 
Oil and Gas Property
 
Oil and gas properties in which the Company has an interest are accounted for using the full-cost accounting method. Producing oil and gas royalty properties are carried at the lower of the cost and net recoverable amount. Depletion is provided on capitalized amounts using the units-of-production method. Net recoverable amount is the aggregate of estimated future net revenues from proven reserves less operating, administration, financial and income tax expense. Estimated future net revenues are determined using year-end prices.
 
(g)  Capital assets
 
Assets expected to remain productive throughout the property's life are depreciated using the units-of-production method. Other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired when fair value, which is considered estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from its operation, is below the asset's carrying value. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices and production levels. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped by segment business (ie. mining operations and oil and gas) as on this basis identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other groups. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties.
 
(h)  Translation of foreign currency
 
Foreign operations are self-sustaining and are translated using the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the period-end and revenue and expense items at average exchange rates for the period. Translation adjustments arising from changes in exchange rates are accounted for as a separate component of shareholders' equity. These adjustments will be included in operations upon realization.
 
(i)  Fair Values of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying value of Cash and Short Term Investments and Accounts Payable in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair values due to the short-term duration of these instruments.
 
(j)  Revenue recognition
 
Gold and silver revenues from mining operations are recognized at the time of shipment from the mine site. The sole operating property of the Company, the Ken Snyder Mine, was sold effective April 2, 2001 (See note 12(a)). Revenue from royalty interests are recognized at the time title passes to the Company under the terms of the respective royalty agreement. Payment is received in cash or in-kind. In-kind receipts consist of physical quantities of gold, silver and platinum. The in-kind receipts are valued at prices on the date of receipt. In-kind revenue recognized for the six months ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 is $30.2 million (unaudited) and $19.2 million (unaudited), respectively. For the three years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 in-kind revenue recognized totaled $48.0 million, $56.1 million and $51.7 million, respectively.
 
(k)  Reclamation and closure costs
 
For the Company's sole operating property, the Ken Snyder Mine, reclamation and closure costs are accrued and charged to income over the estimated life of the mine using the units-of-production method based on
 
 
 
proven and probable reserves. Costs include expected future closure costs based upon current environmental laws and regulations. The Company disposed of the mine effective April 2, 2001 (See Note 12(a)). For royalty interests the Company does not accrue reclamation and closure costs as it is not liable for such costs.
 
The Company records reclamation costs for oil and gas working interest properties as reported by the operator. For oil and gas royalty interests the Company is not liable for such costs.
 
(l)  Foreign exchange contracts
 
The Company manages its foreign exchange exposure on anticipated net cash inflows in Australia through the use of forward contracts. Gains and losses are recognized and reported as a component of the related transactions.
 
(m)  Comparative figures
 
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.
 
2.    Change in Accounting Policy
 
On April 1, 2000 the Company adopted the new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants recommendations for income taxes. Franco-Nevada provides for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, future tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the substantively enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
 
The Company has elected to adopt these standards retroactively without restatement. The cumulative effect of adopting the standard is an increase in future tax liabilities and a reduction in retained earnings of $17.0 million.
 
Prior to April 1, 2000, the Company followed the deferral method of tax allocation in accounting for income taxes.
 
3.    Business Merger
 
On September 20, 1999, the Company announced completion of the merger that resulted in Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited ("Franco-Nevada") merging with Euro-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited ("Euro-Nevada"). The merger of the Company and Euro-Nevada is accounted for as a pooling of interests which combines, at book value, the net assets and operations of the two companies. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared, and are presented as though the predecessor corporations had operated as a single entity since inception. Euro-Nevada shareholders received 0.77 Franco-Nevada shares for each Euro-Nevada share. Euro-Nevada had 101.2 million shares outstanding and, as a result, the Company issued 77.9 million additional common shares to former shareholders of Euro-Nevada.
 
The following tables set forth results of operations of the previously separate companies for the periods before the combination.
 
 
 
 
 
4.    Investments in Marketable Securities

(d)  Income taxes paid in 2001 were $45,249,276 (2000$26,002,590, 1999$19,357,381).
 
 
 
 
10.    Segment information
 
The Company operates in the Mining and Oil and Gas industries. The operations are evaluated and managed in two segments, namely, Mining royalties and Oil and Gas. Mining royalties include precious metals and base metal royalties and the Company's exploration interests that are aimed at generating royalties. Oil and Gas operations are largely in Canada.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11.    Commitments
 
(a)  Foreign Exchange Contracts
 
Franco has entered into foreign exchange contracts whereunder Franco-Nevada will receive Australian $4 million in June 2002 and 2003 at US$0.5873 and US$0.5882 respectively for each Australian dollar. These contracts were closed out subsequent to March 31, 2001.
 
(b)  Net Profits Interest
 
Franco-Nevada pays the contract operator of the Ken Snyder Mine a 5% net profit interest based upon the Company's reported pre-tax profit from the mine. The amount of Net Profit Interest expense included in discontinued operations for the three years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is $2.1 million, $2.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. No expense was incurred for the six month period ended September 30, 2001 as the mine was sold effective April 2, 2001 (See Note 12(a)). The Company incurred an expense of $1.1 million (unaudited) for the six months ended September 30, 2000.
 
12.    Subsequent Event
 
(a)  On April 2, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with Normandy Mining Limited ("Normandy"), Australia's largest gold producer, to exchange its Ken Snyder mine, US$48 million, and its Australian assets in return for a 19.99% interest in Normandy. On May 31, 2001 the transaction was consummated and Normandy issued 446.1 million freely-trading ordinary shares to Franco-Nevada. Franco-Nevada retained a minimum 5% NSR royalty over the Midas property, which escalates at gold prices over US$300 per ounce to a maximum of 10% at gold prices over US$400 per ounce.
 
The exchange of assets resulted in a pre-tax gain of $38.6 million to Franco-Nevada and has been classified as "Discontinued operations." Income taxes of $16.7 million were recorded in connection with the exchange.
 
Amounts included in the consolidated balance sheets relating to discontinued operations are as follows:
 
 
The summarized statements of operations for the discontinued operations are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The summarized statements of cashflows for the discontinued operations are as follows:
 
 
(b)  The Company has announced a change of its year end to December 31 effective for the period ended December 31, 2001.
 
13.    Legal Matters
 
(a)  Environmental
 
The Company's mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are materially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.
 
(b)  Claims
 
The Company is from time to time involved in various claims, legal proceedings and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is also subject to reassessment for income and mining taxes for certain years. It does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding related to any potential tax assessments or other matters, or any amount which it may be required to pay by reason thereof, will have material adverse effect on the financial condition or future results of operations of the Company.
 
 
 
 
14.    Differences Between Canadian and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
Canadian GAAP varies in certain significant respects from the principles and practices generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"). The effect of these principal measurement differences on the Company's consolidated financial statements are quantified below and described in the accompanying notes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The above amounts are net of taxes as follows: September 2001: $272,000, September 2000: $20,867,000, March 2001: $16,913,000, March 2000: ($15,443,000) and March 1999: $4,780,000.
 
 
 
 
The statements of comprehensive earnings provide a measure of all changes in equity the company that results from transactions with other than shareholders and other economic events that occur during the period.
 
The combined impact of notes (a) through (i) has been reflected on the Statements of Cash Flows and Balance Sheets below. No additional adjustments are reflected in the tables.
 
 
Balance Sheets
 
The following summarizes the balance sheet amounts in accordance with US GAAP where different from the amounts reported under Canadian GAAP.
 
 
New Standards for Canadian GAAP
 
In late 2000, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") issued a revised standard, Section 3500, "Earnings Per Share". Public companies with quarterly reporting requirements must calculate basic and fully diluted earnings per share in accordance with the new standard. Diluted earnings per share will now be calculated using the "Treasury Stock Method". The new section will be implemented for the fiscal period ended December 31, 2001.
 
 
 
 
In August 2000, the CICA issued a new standard, Section 1751, "Interim Financial Statements" effective for interim periods in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2001. This standard requires interim financial statements, at a minimum, to include an income and cash flow statement for the quarter and year to date periods, a balance sheet and a statement of retained earnings along with detailed notes to the financial statements. Management does not expect a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company upon the adoption of the new standard.
 
The CICA recently issued new Handbook Sections 1581, "Business Combinations" and 3062, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Effective July 1, 2001, the standards require that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method. Additionally, effective January 1, 2002, goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life will no longer be amortized to earnings and will be assessed for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with the new standards, including a transitional impairment test whereby any resulting impairment will be charged to opening retained earnings. Management does not expect a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company upon the adoption of the new standard.
 
In March 2000, the Accounting Standards Board of the CICA issued Accounting Guideline No. 11, "Enterprises in the Development Stage". The guideline addresses three specific issues: (a) capitalization of costs and expenditures, (b) impairment and (c) disclosure. Prior to its issuance, development stage entities were exempt from following certain aspects of Canadian GAAP. This guideline will require that all companies account for transactions based on the underlying characteristics of the transaction rather than the maturity of the enterprise. The guideline is effective no later than fiscal periods beginning on or after April 1, 2000. The Company is aware that there are two alternative views of how this guideline affects mining companies with respect to the capitalization of exploration costs. CICA Handbook Section 3061 "Property, Plant and Equipment" states that "For a mining property, the cost of the asset includes exploration costs if the enterprise considers that such costs have the characteristics of property, plant and equipment." The Company considers that exploration costs incurred meet the characteristics of property, plant and equipment and accordingly defers such costs. Under the view adopted by the Company, deferred exploration costs would not automatically be subject to regular assessments of recoverability, unless conditions such as those in Accounting Guideline No. 11 exist. Under the alternative view, there would be a regular assessment of capitalized exploration costs. Assessment of the probability of recoverability of deferred exploration costs from future operations would require the preparation of a projection based on objective evidence of economic reserves, such as a feasibility study. The Company's interpretation of the guideline will not have a significant impact on the financial statements. However, if the second view is accepted, all deferred exploration costs would be written off as of the beginning of fiscal 2001. This write-off would be treated as a change in accounting principle. The result would be a reduction of resource properties of $49.0 million, a decrease to retained earnings of $30.9 million and a reduction to future taxes of $18.1 million. The impact for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 would be a reduction in resource properties of $3.5 million, net income of $2.3 million and future taxes of $1.2 million. For the six-month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 the reduction to resource properties, net income and future taxes would be $1.9 million, $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The CICA is currently evaluating this issue to determine the appropriate interpretation of the guideline and CICA Handbook Section 3061.
 
New Standards for US GAAP
 
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 141 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination
 
 
 
whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets. These standards require all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 141 for business combinations after July 1, 2001 and 142 on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2002. Management does not expect a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company upon the adoption of the new standard.
 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently issued FASB No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". FAS 144 supersedes FAS 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB 30 for segments of a business to be disposed of. The pronouncement is effective January 1, 2002, and will be adopted by the Company at that time. Management does not expect a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company upon the adoption of the new standard.

1    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standard, Urgent Issues Group Consensus Views and the Corporations Act 2001. It is prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets which are noted as at valuation. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous year.
 
The directors have elected under section 334 (5) of the Corporations Act 2001 to apply Accounting Standard AASB 1041 "Revaluation of Non-Current Assets" for this financial year, even though the standard is not required to be applied until annual reporting periods beginning on or after 30 September 2001.
 
This financial report has been prepared using Australian dollars.
 
(a)    Principles of consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements are presented as one set of financial statements and include all entities which comprise the Normandy Mining Limited consolidated entity, being the parent entity and its controlled entities. There are no controlled entities in the consolidated entity other than those listed in Note 28. The effects of all transactions between entities within the consolidated entity are eliminated in full.
 
(b)    Foreign currencies
 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been brought to account at the exchange rates ruling at the time of the transactions. At balance date, foreign currency receivables and payables are translated at exchange rates ruling at that date.
 
Exchange gains and losses and hedging costs arising on contracts entered into as hedges of specific revenue or expense transactions are deferred until the date of such transactions at which time they are included in the determination of such revenues or expenses.
 
Assets and liabilities of self-sustaining overseas controlled entities are translated at exchange rates ruling at balance date and any exchange gain or loss arising on translation is carried directly to a foreign currency translation reserve.
 
When anticipated purchase or sale transactions have been hedged, actual purchases or sales which occur during the hedged period are accounted for as having been hedged until the amounts of those transactions are fully allocated against the hedged amounts.
 
Where a hedge transaction is terminated early and the anticipated transaction is still expected to occur as designated the deferred gains and losses that arose on the hedge prior to its termination continue to be deferred and are included in the measurement of the purchase or sale or interest transaction when it occurs. Where a hedge transaction is terminated early because the anticipated transaction is no longer expected to occur as designated, deferred gains and losses that arose on the hedge prior to its termination are included in the statement of financial performance for the period.
 
(c)    Revenue
 
Gold bullion is taken up as a sale in the period during which it is shipped from the mine, provided it is either sold or delivered to a gold refinery within the normal time span. Bullion delivered against forward sales contracts is accounted for at the contract rate. Base metal concentrate sales are recognised at the estimated sales value when delivery has occurred and pricing is determinable and adjusted for variations in metal price, assay, weight and currency at the time of final settlement. Other sales are taken up when title passes.

1    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CONT.)
 
Gold bullion held at year end is valued at the contract rates for those hedges it is expected to be delivered into. Base metal concentrate debtors are valued at the relevant forward contract US dollar rate.
 
Royalty revenue is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
 
Gains or costs arising upon entry into hedging transaction intended to hedge the sale of goods, together with subsequent exchange gains or losses resulting from those transactions are deferred up to the date of sale and included in the measurement of the sale.
 
If the hedging transaction is terminated prior to its maturity date and the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, deferral of any gains and losses which arose prior to termination continues and those gains and losses are included in the measurement of the hedged transaction.
 
In those circumstances where a hedging transaction is terminated prior to maturity because the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, any previously deferred gains and losses are recognised in the statements of financial performance at the date of termination.
 
If a hedge transaction relating to a commitment for the sale of goods or services is redesignated as a hedge of another specific commitment and the original transaction is still expected to occur, the gains and losses that arise on the hedge prior to its redesignation are deferred and included in the measurement of the original sale when it takes place. If the hedge transaction is redesignated as a hedge of another commitment because the original sale transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains and losses that arise on the hedge prior to its redesignation are recognised in the statements of financial performance at the date of the redesignation.
 
(d)    Receivables
 
Receivables are recorded at amounts due less any provision for doubtful debts.
 
(e)    Derivatives
 
Derivative financial instruments are not recognised in the financial statements on inception. The costs associated with entering hedge transactions in respect of commodity sales together with gains or losses to the date of sale are deferred and included in the measurement of the final sale price. Additional information in respect of hedging is set out in Note 32.
 
The amount received or paid under interest rate swaps is recognised as an adjustment to interest rate expense when the cash flow takes place.
 
(f)    Income tax
 
Income tax has been brought to account using the liability method of tax effect accounting, whereby the income tax expense for the year is matched with the accounting profit after allowance for permanent differences. Income tax set aside on cumulative timing differences is brought to account as either a deferred income tax liability or an asset described as a future income tax benefit at the rate of income tax applicable to the period in which the liability will become payable or the benefit will be received. The future income tax benefit relating to tax losses is not carried forward as an asset unless the benefit can be regarded as being virtually certain of realisation. The future income tax benefit relating to timing differences is not carried forward as an asset unless its realisation is assured beyond any reasonable doubt. No provision has been made for any taxes on capital gains which could arise in the event of a sale of certain revalued non-current assets for the amount at which they are stated in the financial statements as it is not expected that any such liability will crystallise.

(CONT.)
 
(g)    Goodwill
 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over the period during which the benefits are expected to arise based on the life of the mine or over a period of twenty years whichever is the lesser.
 
(h)    Inventories
 
Inventories, apart from gold bullion, are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Costs are assigned to inventories on hand by the method most appropriate to each class of inventory with the majority being valued on an average cost basis. Costs of production include fixed and variable direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed overhead expenditure, depreciation and mine amortisation.
 
(i)    Other financial assets
 
The consolidated entity's investments in listed shares and other corporations are carried at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Dividend income attributable to the investments is recognised in profits when received. Loans to other corporations are recorded at amounts due less any provisions for doubtful loans.
 
(j)    Joint ventures
 
 
The proportionate interests in the assets and liabilities of joint venture operations have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings. Details of the joint ventures are set out in Note 29.
 
(ii)    Joint Venture entities
 
The consolidated entity's interest in the assets, liabilities and expenses of a joint venture entities are accounted for using the equity method. Additional information is provided in note 30.
 
(k)    Associated entities
 
The equity method is applied in respect of investments in associated entities in which the consolidated entity has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a 20% to 50% ownership interest is presumed to provide the consolidated entity significant influence.
 
(l)    Exploration and evaluation expenditure
 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred by the consolidated entity is accumulated for each area of interest and recorded as an asset, if either:
 
 
 
The expenditure incurred in areas of interest located around existing milling facilities is provided for over the life of the milling facilities. Expenditure on all other areas of interest is expensed for as the expenditure is incurred other than for exploration assets acquired, which are initially recorded at cost.
 
The recoverable amount of each area of interest is determined on a bi-annual basis so that the net carrying amount does not exceed the recoverable amount. For areas of interest which are not considered to have any commercial value, or where exploration rights are no longer current, the capitalised amounts are written off against the provision and any remaining amounts are charged against profit.

(m)    Development properties
 
Where it has been established to the satisfaction of Directors that ore reserves or mineral resources exist, development expenditure is accumulated as development properties. No amortisation is provided in respect of development properties until they are reclassified as mine properties following commencement of production.
 
(n)    Depreciation and amortisation
 
Mine properties are amortised on a units of production basis once production has commenced. Property, plant and equipment specific to mine properties are depreciated over the lesser of the expected useful life on a straight-line basis or the life of the mine on a units of production basis. The units of production method causes rates of depreciation and amortisation to vary according to the rate at which production has depleted the estimated future mineable reserves of the respective mines. Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Land is not subject to depreciation.
 
For open pit mines, estimated future mineable reserves are comprised of proved and probable reserves of the mine site.
 
For underground mines, estimated future mineable reserves are based on the consolidated entity's informal resource category denoted as High Confidence Resource (HCR). Underground mining has usually well established reserve positions that are accompanied by less well-defined mineralization that is recognized to have a high probability of future conversion to reserve category.
 
(o)    Prepaid/Deferred mining costs
 
Direct expenditure on surface mining is charged to operations at the life of mine stripping ratio of ore to waste for each pit. Under this method, costs are deferred when the actual stripping ratio exceeds the average life of mine stripping ratio and accrued when the actual stripping ratio is below the average life of mine ratio. The consolidated weighted-average waste ore ratio used for the years ended 30 June 2001, 2000 and 1999 are 5.20, 5.22 and 4.01, respectively.
 
Costs incurred in developing drives in underground mines are apportioned over the life of the mine using a pre-determined ratio of development metres to tonnes of ore reserve. A prepayment or provision is booked whenever the metres developed for a period differs from the mine life ratio.
 
Prepaid mining costs are disclosed in Note 17 "Other Assets" and deferred mining costs are disclosed in Note 19 "Provisions".
 
These costs are incurred in waste removal activities and relate directly to the ounces produced over the life of the mine. Complete reversal of these amounts does not occur until the ultimate closure of the mine.
 
Periodically, the consolidated entity reviews the recoverable value of prepaid mining costs as part of a review of asset carrying values associated with each mine. The review is based on current factors surrounding the mine, including any changes in the expected life of the mine and the price of gold. If the recoverable value of these assets, taken as a whole, has fallen below the carrying value, the assets are written down to recoverable value.
 
(p)    Recoverable amount of non-current assets
 
Each reporting period, the recoverable amount of all non-current assets is assessed.
 
Normandy Mining Limited

1    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CONT.)
 
Where the carrying amount of a non-current asset is greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is revalued down to its recoverable amount. Where net cash inflows are derived from a group of assets working together, such as at a mining operation, recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the relevant group of assets.
 
The expected net cash flows included in determining recoverable amounts of non-current assets are discounted to their present values using a market-determined, risk-adjusted discount rate. The effect of capital gains tax has not been taken into account.
 
(q)    Mine completion costs
 
Provision is made for estimated rehabilitation expenditure, decommissioning and closure costs using the incremental method on a units of production basis over the life of the mine from the time production commences. Future total mine completion costs are estimated annually on an undiscounted basis taking into account all current environmental and legal requirements and if material, are adjusted in the period of change.
 
Rehabilitation costs recognised include regrading of waste dumps, revegetation and erosion and drainage control, in order to allow for relinquishment of mining titles with no ongoing maintenance costs. Rehabilitation costs associated with exploration and evaluation activities are treated as exploration and evaluation expenditure.
 
(r)    Employee entitlements
 
Provision is made for all known obligations in respect of employees. Annual leave, long service leave and vested sick leave are provided at the current rate of pay as per the relevant awards and employee contracts. Provisions for long service leave commence at the anniversary of three years of service, with further amounts being provided as the entitlement grows beyond three years. It is expected that the resultant provision for long service leave will approximate the present value of the estimated future cash outflows associated with long service leave.
 
Additional information in respect of employee entitlements including ownership based remuneration schemes is provided in Note 36.
 
(s)    Accounts payable
 
Trade payables and other accounts payable are recognised when the economic entity becomes obliged to make future payments resulting from the purchase of goods and services.
 
(t)    Acquisition of assets
 
Assets acquired are recorded at the cost of acquisition, being the purchase consideration determined as at the date of acquisition plus costs incidental to the acquisition. In the event that settlement of all or part of the cash consideration given in the acquisition of an asset is deferred, the fair value of the purchase consideration is determined by discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present value as at the date of acquisition.
 
(u)    Borrowing costs
 
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred except where they relate to the financing of projects under construction where they are capitalised up to the date of commissioning or sale. Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised from the commencement of commercial production.
 
(v)    Interest bearing liabilities
 
Debentures, bank loans and other loans are recorded at an amount equal to the net proceeds received. Interest expense is recognised on an accrual basis. Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are deferred and amortised on a straight line basis over the period of borrowing.

(w)    Rounding amounts
 
The Company is of the kind referred to in Class order 98/100 dated 10 July 1998 issued by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. In accordance with that Class Order amounts in this report and the financial report have been rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars, except where rounding to the nearest one thousand dollars is required.
 
(x)    Comparative amounts
 
The consolidated entity has adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards AASB 1018 "Statement of Financial Performance", AASB 1034 "Financial Report Presentation and Disclosure" and AASB 1040 "Statement of Financial Position" for the first time in the preparation of this financial report. In accordance with the requirements of these new/revised Standards, comparative amounts have been reclassified in order to comply with the new presentation format. The reclassification of comparative amounts has not resulted in a change to the aggregate amounts of current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities or equity, or the net profit/loss of the company as reported in the prior year financial report.

Adjustment to deferred income tax balances
 
Legislation reducing the Australian company income tax rate from 36% to 34% in respect of the 2000-2001 income tax year and then to 30% from the 2001-2002 income tax year was announced on 21 September 1999 and received Royal Assent on 10 December 1999. As a consequence, deferred tax balances which are expected to reverse in the 2000-2001 or a later income tax year have been remeasured using the appropriate new rates, depending on the timing of their reversal.

Normandy Group Finance Ltd, a wholly owned entity, has a $650 million committed revolving multi-option facility with a syndicate of banks established in November 1997. The facility consists of three tranches. Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are available to a maximum of $370 million and mature in November 2001. Tranche 3 is a term facility available to a maximum of $280 million and matures in November 2003. All tranches are at an interest rate dependent on the currency drawn plus a margin of 0.60 percent. Interest is paid at the end of each interest period nominated by the borrower, to a maximum of 180 days. As at 30 June 2001 Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 were undrawn (2000: $60 million) and the amount drawn down under Tranche 3 was $200 million (2000: $110 million).
 
Normandy NFM Limited, a controlled entity, had a $25 million committed revolving multi-option facility which matured in August 2001. As at 30 June 2001, this facility was undrawn (2000: $11 million drawn). Interest was paid at an interest rate dependent on the currency drawn plus a margin of 0.7 percent at the end of each interest period nominated by the borrower, to a maximum of 180 days.
 
Normandy NFM Limited has a committed short term $10 million overdraft facility, which at 30 June 2001 was undrawn (2000: undrawn).
 
 
In July 1998, Normandy Finance Limited ("NFL") issued US$100 million of seven year 7.5 percent and US$150 million of ten year 7.625 percent guaranteed notes. Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually in arrears. Certain financial instruments were entered into whereby NFL has agreed to exchange the US dollar fixed interest amounts payable on the seven and ten year notes, with the 90 day Australian dollar bank bill rate plus a margin of 1.70 percent and 1.76 percent respectively. The US$250 million has been recorded at $403.2 million (2000: $403.2 million) reflecting the future exchange rate of the hedge transaction.
 
In April 1998, Normandy Yandal Operations Limited (formerly Great Central Mines Limited) issued US$300 million of ten year 8.875 percent senior unsecured notes. Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually in arrears. Certain financial instruments were entered into whereby Normandy Yandal Operations Limited has agreed to exchange US dollar fixed interest amounts payable with gold interest rate exposure. Of the total, US$183.6 million has been swapped into a gold interest rate exposure, of which half is fixed at 3.87% and half is floating. The floating rate at 30 June 2001 was 2.07% (2000: 1.49%).
 
 
A controlled entity has a loan facility in respect of the Ovacik mine for US$40.0 million, established in December 1996, subsequently refinanced in May 1998 and in April 2000.

Under an outright forward the forward price for the gold sale is fixed at the time of entering into the contract. Gold leasing fees are charged for the life of the contract and are set on a periodic basis at the discretion of the consolidated entity. The net price realised is the fixed contract price net of accrued gold leasing fees (paid at maturity of the contract).
 
Under a short term rolling contract a spot transaction has been entered into and is being rolled periodically, with the new contract price being calculated on a net contango basis at each maturity date.
 
The 90 day gold lease rate and the 12 month gold lease rate at 30 June 2001 were 1.66% and 1.99% respectively (2000: 0.88% and 1.51%). Over the 12 months to 30 June 2001 the 90 day lease rate has been in the range 0.58% to 4.23% (2000: 0.62% to 9.14%) and averaged 1.29% (2000: 1.876%) and the 12 month lease rate has been in the range 1.25% to 2.69% (2000: 1.30% to 6.56%) and averaged 1.61% (2000: 2.29%).
 
The consolidated entity normally settles gold forward sale contracts by delivery of the underlying commodity.
 
Options
 
If exercised, gold put options are normally settled by delivery of gold.
 
Forward rate agreements
 
Forward rate agreements are used to fix future gold leasing rate exposures resulting from the outright forward positions described above. The agreements swap floating gold leasing rates for fixed rates with the transaction net settled at maturity in gold ounces.
 
 
Outright forward contracts and options contracts have been entered into by the consolidated entity.
 
Forward sales contracts
 
Base metals contracts are net settled against the average price of the pricing month of the physical shipment (in US dollars). A net amount is paid or received by the consolidated entity.
 
Foreign exchange contracts
 
Outright forward sales contracts are entered into to hedge US dollar receipts associated with base metals activities.
 
Options
 
If exercised, base metals put and call options are net settled against monthly market averages.
 
The costs of entering into these contracts and any realized or unrealized gains or losses are deferred until the underlying shipment occurs. The gains and losses deferred as at balance date and the periods to which they relate are set out in the table.
 
 
Contracts to purchase and sell foreign exchange are entered into to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currencies.

The consolidated entity is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties (banks) with respect to the financial instruments, however exposures to individual counterparties are limited in accordance with policy set by the Board.
 
The maximum credit risk on financial assets, which have been recognised on the balance sheet, other than investments in shares, is generally the carrying amount of the asset.
 
For off balance sheet financial assets, which are deliverable, including derivatives, credit risk also arises from the potential failure of counterparties to meet their obligations under the respective contracts at maturity. A material exposure arises from gold hedging and the consolidated entity is exposed to loss in the event that counterparties fail to settle on contracts, which are favorable to the consolidated entity. Unrealised gains on these contracts, net of master netting agreements, at balance date are $178.8 million (2000: $73.3 million). In order to mitigate these risks, the Board has approved a list of banks as appropriate counterparties, all rated A- or better by Standard and Poors.

33    CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
(CONT.)
 
In an action brought by ASIC against Yandal Gold Pty Ltd, the Federal Court found the defendants to have committed various breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 and ordered payment by Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd ("Edensor") to ASIC of $28.5 million for distribution to former Normandy Yandal Operations Limited shareholders. An appeal by Edensor to the Full Court of the Federal Court, to which Normandy became a party on the application of ASIC, was allowed on the basis that the Federal Court lacked jurisdiction to make the order. This decision was appealed to the High Court, which overturned the Full Federal Court decision. The High Court held that the Federal Court did have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter and make orders under the Corporations Act 2001. The High Court has sent the matter back to the Full Federal Court to determine Edensor's appeal on the merits. Prior to the Federal Court appeal and in order to get a stay in enforcement of the original judgement, Normandy paid $28.5 million into Court and Edensor agreed to bear half this amount if it was paid out of Court to former Normandy Yandal Operations Limited shareholders. Following the High Court appeal, the amount paid into Court has been recovered, but if the Full Federal Court determines Edensor's appeal against Edensor, the consolidated entity will be obliged to pay that amount plus interest to ASIC. Edensor remains bound to the consolidated entity to bear half that amount.
 
During the year Normandy Mining Limited provided a $90.0 million contingent equity commitment under which AMC may call upon Normandy Mining Limited to subscribe for AMC shares in the event that the Stanwell Magnesium Project does not achieve certain specified production and operating criteria by no later that September 2006.

The shares are offered at a price determined by the Board (at a discount of up to 5 percent of the prevailing market price) and employees may elect to pay cash for the shares or apply for a loan from the parent entity. Such loans are repayable over a maximum period of 10 years at a concessional rate of interest, which is currently 4 percent. Shares issued under the scheme are non-transferable for a period of one year from the date of issue after which time an application is made for official quotation of the shares.
 
Details of shares offered and issued to employees under the plan are as follows:
 
 
The market price of a Normandy Mining Limited ordinary share at 30 June 2001 was $1.24 (2000: $0.90).

Under this plan Executive Directors, Executives and Employees of the Company and associated entities may be eligible, at the discretion of the Board, to an allocation of rights to unlisted options. These rights vest once certain performance hurdles are met. During and since the end of the financial year an aggregate of 4,112,500 options over shares in Normandy Mining Limited were granted.
 
Options are granted for nil consideration. Each option carries a right to subscribe for one ordinary share in the Company in certain periods. The exercise price of the option is the weighted average market price per share during the 60 trading days prior to the date of acceptance of the rights to options, less the total amount of dividend per share. The dividend per share is calculated as the higher of the actual dividend per share for the period from the date of acceptance of the rights to options and the exercise date, and the average dividend per share paid by the Company for the 3 years preceding. The minimum exercise price is $1.00. An application is made for official quotation of the shares at the time of issue.
 
At 30 June 2001 no options had been granted under this plan.
 
The Employee Share Bonus Plan
 
The Company's Employee Share Bonus Plan was established on 26 November 1991. Each year the Board determines whether eligible persons will receive a bonus. The bonus is calculated as a percentage of salary package and is apportioned into two tranches: 50 percent as an allocation of rights to options and 50 percent as cash or as additional allocation of rights to options. Rights to options allocated in lieu of cash vest upon the eligible person's acceptance of the Company's offer. Rights to the balance of the options allocated each year vest over the following three years.
 
Options are granted for nil consideration. Each option carries a right to subscribe for fully paid ordinary shares on any business day up until its expiry date, being five years from the date of issue. For all options, which were vested before 1 May 1996, the employee is entitled to receive 1.101 Normandy shares for each option exercised. For all options, which were vested after 1 May 1996, the employee is entitled to receive one Normandy share for each option exercised. The exercise price of the option is at 5 percent discount to the market price ruling when the allocations are made.
 
It is management's intention that no further allocation of rights to options will be made under the plan.
 
Details of options vested and outstanding under the plan are as follows:

39    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
Since the end of the financial year, a proposed equity raising by a controlled entity, Australian Magnesium Corporation Ltd, was initially unsuccessful. Following additional negotiations in relation to alternate funding sources, it is the Directors' expectation that the equity raising will successfully proceed. No adjustment is required to the reported results and no material impact on the financial results for the subsequent period is expected.

40    RECONCILIATION TO US GAAP
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Australia ("A-GAAP"), which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The following is a summary of the significant adjustments to net loss attributable to members of the parent entity and total equity required when reconciling such amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements to the corresponding amounts in accordance with US GAAP, considering the significant differences between A-GAAP and US GAAP.
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated entity's 2001 consolidated financial statements, management determined that an error had been made in the 2001 reconciliation to US GAAP. As a result, the reconciliation to US GAAP and related narrative have been restated. This Note reflects the restated reconciliation amount and narratives. Note 41 includes discussion and quantification of the restatement.

a.    Foreign currency translation reserve
 
Under A-GAAP, the foreign currency translation reserve is not adjusted upon disposal of a foreign controlled entity. Under US GAAP, the foreign currency translation reserve attributable to the disposed entity is recognised as part of the gain or loss resulting from the disposal.
 
b.    Gold bullion
 
Revenue recognition
 
Under A-GAAP, gold bullion is recorded as a sale in the period during which it is shipped from the mine, provided it is either sold or delivered to a gold refinery within the normal time span. For US GAAP purposes, revenue from sales of gold bullion is recognised under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101: when delivery of third-party refined gold to the customer has occurred, the pricing is either fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. As a consequence, revenue recognised under A-GAAP relating to gold bullion which has been shipped from the mine and either sold or delivered to a gold refinery within the normal time span but does not qualify as a sale under US GAAP is reversed at period end. As part of this reversal, the related gold bullion is revalued at cost and put back into inventory for US GAAP purposes.
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
 
Valuation
 
Under A-GAAP, gold bullion on hand is valued at contract rates for those hedges it is expected to be delivered into. Under US GAAP gold bullion on hand is valued at cost.
 
c.    Business interruption insurance claims
 
Insurance claim proceeds
 
During the years ended 30 June 2001 and 2000, the consolidated entity recognised expected insurance proceeds associated with business interruption claims. This is acceptable under A-GAAP where there is a virtual certainty of recovery from the insurers. Under US GAAP, the recognition of business interruption insurance proceeds is appropriate only when the insurance proceeds are received or a non-refundable amount has been acknowledged in writing by the insurers.
 
Capitalisation of costs
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity capitalised costs incurred during the years ended 30 June 2001 and 2000 to restore underground mine access after a failure of a stope barricade on 26 June 2000. The costs were capitalised as they were expected to be recovered by the proceeds from the business interruption claims notified with its insurers. As such costs relate to repairs rather than capital improvements, the costs are expensed as incurred under US GAAP.
 
d.    Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
 
As explained in Notes 1(e) and 32, derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not traded. Under A-GAAP, gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged transaction occurs.

Transition adjustment on adoption of SFAS 133
 
For US GAAP purposes, the consolidated entity adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133: , as amended by SFAS No. 137: and SFAS No. 138: and related interpretations (collectively referred to as "SFAS 133") effective 1 July 2000. SFAS 133 requires derivatives to be recorded at their fair value as either an asset or liability in the consolidated statements of financial position. Gains and losses on derivatives, which qualify as cash flow hedges, are accumulated in equity as other comprehensive income and are recognised in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs. Gains and losses on non-qualifying derivatives are recorded in earnings immediately as are the gains and losses on fair value hedges and their hedged items.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities
 
On transition to SFAS 133, a loss of $231.9 million after tax ($238.9 million before tax) has been recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the fair value of qualifying cash flow-type hedges held on 1 July 2000, and a loss of $49.3 million after tax ($52.6 million before tax) has been recognised in the US GAAP earnings for the year ended 30 June 2001 in respect of the fair value of non-qualifying cash flow type hedges held on 1 July 2000. Assets have increased by $27.5 million and liabilities by $308.7 million reflecting the fair values of derivatives qualifying as fair value-type and cash flow-type hedges on transition.
 
Hedging activities
 
The majority of the consolidated entity's derivatives instruments are forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative but qualify for the normal purchase and sale exemption as they are settled by physical delivery. With the exception of these contracts, the Company has not completed the required documentation, designation and effectiveness assessments required under SFAS 133 for derivatives used in hedging activities. For the year ended 30 June 2001, a net loss of $221.6 million before tax, plus an opening transition adjustment of $52.6 million before tax, resulting in a total net loss of $274.2 million before tax has been recognised in US GAAP earnings. The net loss recognised in US GAAP earnings excluding the transition adjustment reflecting the total movement in fair value of non-qualifying derivative instruments of $115.3 million, a reclassification of the transition adjustment from other comprehensive income of $3.8 million to match hedged transactions affecting earnings in the current year and an unrealised foreign exchange loss of $102.5 million in respect of the US dollar debt as described below.
 
The consolidated entity does not recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on the unhedged US dollar debt of a controlled entity in the A-GAAP accounts on the basis that it hedges future US dollar denominated sales; however US GAAP does not permit this treatment and requires the unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on the US dollar debt to be recognised in the calculation of net profit/(loss).
 
e.    Deferred income taxes
 
Temporary differences
 
Under A-GAAP, timing differences are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred tax assets and liabilities using the liability method of tax effect accounting. Future income tax benefits relating to carry forward tax losses are not recorded as an asset unless the benefit is "virtually certain" of being realised. Realisation of benefits relating

40    RECONCILIATION TO US GAAP
(CONT.)
 
to other timing differences must be "beyond reasonable doubt" before they may be booked. Under US GAAP, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to all differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when it is "more likely than not" that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
 
Purchase business combinations
 
In connection with a purchase business combination, US GAAP requires deferred taxes to be provided for the tax effects of differences between the fair values and the tax bases of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Deferred taxes are only provided on goodwill when the amortisation of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes in the respective tax jurisdiction. A-GAAP does not require the recognition of deferred taxes arising from fair value adjustments attributable to a purchase business combination.
 
Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
 
Under A-GAAP, deferred taxes are provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries when it is known that the funds will be remitted to the parent (other than through a tax-free liquidation). Under US GAAP, there is a presumption that all undistributed earnings will be distributed to the parent by its subsidiaries. This presumption can be overcome if sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. Unless the presumption is overcome, US GAAP requires the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings. For foreign subsidiaries, US GAAP also requires deferred taxes to be provided on the related foreign currency translation reserve. Under A-GAAP, there is no such requirement to provide deferred taxes on the related foreign currency translation reserve.
 
f.    Investments in associated entities and joint ventures
 
In accordance with the equity method and proportionate consolidation method of accounting, the consolidated entity records its relative share of net profits or losses reported by the associated companies and joint ventures for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Accordingly, this adjustment includes the consolidated entity's proportionate share of A-GAAP to US GAAP adjustments to the net profit/(loss) of associated companies and joint ventures (other than Great Central Minessee paragraph (p)).
 
g.    Impairment of investments
 
Impairment of investment in associated entity
 
Under the equity method of accounting, investments in associated entities are recorded at acquisition cost and adjusted for the consolidated entity's proportionate share of net profits or losses reported by the investee, dividends received from the investee and amortisation of the difference in the underlying equity in net assets of the investee and the cost of the investment (collectively referred to as the "adjusted cost"). Under A-GAAP, investments in associated entities are valued at the lower of adjusted cost or recoverable amount. Each reporting period, the carrying value is assessed. An impairment loss is recorded when the future discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the investment are less than the carrying value of the investment.

40    RECONCILIATION TO US GAAP
(CONT.)
 
Under US GAAP, investments in associated entities are valued at adjusted cost less other than temporary write-downs. At each reporting date, the carrying value is assessed and a write-down is made to the fair value based on quoted market prices (if available) when evidence indicates that the decline in value for a period of six to nine months or more is other than temporary.
 
At 30 June 2000, a decline in the market price of an associated entity was deemed to be other than temporary. As such, the investment in the associated entity (as adjusted for the proportionate share of A-GAAP to US GAAP adjustments) was written down to the quoted market price under US GAAP. A write-down was not made under A-GAAP as the future discounted net cash flows exceeded the A-GAAP carrying value of the investment.
 
Reversal of impairment of investment in associated entity
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity reversed an impairment charge during the year ended 30 June 2000 related to a prior period write-down of an investment in an associated entity (such write-down was not taken under US GAAP in the prior period as the impairment was not deemed other than temporary). Reversals of impairments are not allowed under US GAAP.
 
Impairment of investment in mining tenements
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity's investment in mining tenements, subject to bi-annual impairment review, was written down during the year ended 30 June 1994 because the discounted future cash flows were less than carrying value. Under US GAAP, the investment is accounted for as a fixed asset and amortised on a units of production basis over the useful life of the asset. The impairment was not taken under US GAAP during the year ended 30 June 1994, as the undiscounted cash flows were greater than the carrying value of the asset. For US GAAP purposes, the consolidated entity continues to amortise the mining tenements and assesses impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
 
h.    Investment in listed shares
 
Under A-GAAP, the listed shares are valued at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Each reporting period, the recoverable amount is assessed. An impairment loss is recorded when the future discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the investment are less than the carrying amount of the listed shares.
 
Under US GAAP, the listed shares are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealised gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income until realised. Declines in market value for a period of six to nine months or more judged to be other than temporary are recognised in earnings.
 
i.    Exploration and evaluation expenditure
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity allows exploration and evaluation expenditure to be accumulated for each area of interest and recorded as an asset (subject to a recoverable amount test) if either: (i) it is expected to be recouped through successful development of and production from the area, or by its sale; or (ii) significant exploration or evaluation of the area is continuing. For areas of interest which are not considered to have any commercial value, or where exploration rights are no longer current, the capitalised amounts are written off against earnings.

(CONT.)
 
Under US GAAP, exploration and evaluation expenditure (including the cost of feasibility studies) is expensed as incurred for an area of interest until commercial feasibility is established in compliance with Securities Act Industry Guide 7. After an area of interest has been assessed as commercially feasible, expenditures specific to that area of interest for further development are capitalised.
 
j.    Pilot plant
 
A controlled entity has capitalised costs under A-GAAP which are associated with the construction, commissioning and maintenance of a pilot plant. The ongoing operation of the pilot plant is not for commercial production but rather to facilitate continued research and development. The capitalised costs associated with the pilot plant will be amortised upon the commencement of commercial production from the full-scale plant. Under US GAAP, costs associated with the design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible to the enterprise for commercial production are considered research and development and expensed as incurred.
 
k.    Impairment of development properties and property, plant and equipment
 
Under A-GAAP, the recoverable amount of non-current assets including development properties and property, plant and equipment is assessed each reporting period. An impairment loss is recorded when the future discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset.
 
Under US GAAP, long-lived assets and goodwill related to those assets is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset (as adjusted from A-GAAP to US GAAP) to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets' use at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are generated. Generally, all assets at a particular mine are used together to generate cash flows. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering mine plans. When the cash flow analysis indicates an asset is impaired, the impairment loss to be recognised is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined by quoted market prices, discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques.
 
The aforementioned differences in impairment evaluation and recognition methodologies has resulted in (i) reversal of A-GAAP impairment losses recognised during the year ended 30 June 2001 relating to the Bronzewing mine assets and during 1999 Ovacik and Kasese mine assets and (ii) the recognition of US GAAP impairment losses on Ovacik assets during the year ended 30 June 2001 and Kasese assets during 2000.
 
Further impairment adjustments were made in respect of Great Central Mines Limited but these have been described and classified in the US GAAP reconciliation under note (p) below.
 
l.    Provision for mine completion costs
 
The consolidated entity recognises a provision for estimated mine completion costs (i.e., rehabilitation expenditure, decommissioning and closure costs) using the incremental method on a units of production basis over the life of the mine from the time production commences. Future total mine completion costs are estimated

(CONT.)
 
annually on an undiscounted basis taking into account all current environmental and legal requirements. Under A-GAAP, a material change in estimate of the future total mine completion costs is accounted for in the period the change is made. Under US GAAP, a change in estimate of such costs must be accounted for in the period of change and future periods if the change affects both.
 
m.    Provision for redundancy and restructuring
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity recognised a provision for office closure costs and employee redundancy payments in connection with the intended rationalisation of certain business activities. Under US GAAP, such costs may only be accrued if they are part of a formal restructuring plan approved by management that specifically identifies the significant actions to be taken to complete the plan, activities that will not be continued, the number and job classifications of employees to be terminated, as well as other strict criteria. As all of the criteria for accrual have not been met, payments for restructuring and redundancy are expensed as incurred under US GAAP.
 
n.    Share-based compensation costs
 
Under A-GAAP, no cost is attributed to the value of shares or share options granted to employees under the terms of the ownership-based remuneration schemes as disclosed in Note 36. Under US GAAP, the consolidated entity has elected to account for the issuance of shares and share options granted to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25: and related interpretations ("APB 25"). The consolidated entity's ownership-based remuneration schemes are accounted for as follows under APB 25:
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
Employee Share Investment Plan
 
The Employee Share Investment Plan is deemed to be non-compensatory under APB 25. As such, no compensation expense is recognised for issuances of shares to employees under the Plan.
 
Executive Share Incentive Plan
 
The Executive Share Incentive Plan is considered a variable plan under APB 25 as the exercise price is not known at the date of grant. Rights to share options under the Plan vest over three years provided performance hurdles are met. Under APB 25, estimates of compensation cost, measured as the excess of the quoted market price over the estimated exercise price, are recorded prior to the measurement date when management determines that it is probable that the performance hurdles will be met, and adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in the quoted market price. Compensation expense was recognised under APB 25 during the year ended 30 June 2001, considering the unforfeited performance options outstanding, the quoted market price of the shares and the average elapsed performance period.
 
Employee Bonus Share Plan
 
The Employee Share Bonus Plan is considered a fixed plan under APB 25 as the exercise price and number of shares are known at the date of grant. No compensation cost is recognised under APB 25 as the exercise price of the share options exceeded the market price of the stock at the date of grant of the rights to share options.

o.    Capitalisation of borrowing costs
 
Prior to 1 July 1998, all borrowing costs were expensed as incurred under A-GAAP. Effective 1 July 1998, A-GAAP requires interest capitalisation on assets constructed for the consolidated entity's own use when the asset is under construction for a period greater than 12 months. US GAAP requires the capitalisation of interest on assets constructed for the consolidated entity's own use (from inception of the consolidated entity), regardless of the length of the construction period.
 
For purposes of US GAAP, additional interest of $4.3 million and $3.0 million was capitalised during the years ended 30 June 2001 and 2000, respectively. Depreciation of such capitalised interest amounted to $1.9 million and $1.7 million during the respective years.
 
p.    Acquisition of and investment in Great Central Mines
 
Goodwill
 
The consolidated entity purchased Great Central Mines Limited ("GCM") through a step acquisition over several years, resulting in 100% ownership of the outstanding shares of GCM on 5 April 2000. At each phase of the acquisition, the consolidated entity recorded its pro rata share of the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, with the difference recorded as excess purchase consideration and amortised over the maximum period of 20 years under A-GAAP. In accordance with Australian Accounting Standard 1013: , the excess purchase consideration was written off on 5 April 2000 following assessment by management because the amount did not constitute goodwill as defined under A-GAAP.
Accounting for Goodwill
 
Under US GAAP, the SEC does not allow an immediate write-off of purchase price at the acquisition date, or shortly thereafter. As such, the excess purchase price was allocated to goodwill rather than mineral property interests given that excess purchase price was clearly indicated based on the valuations of the mineral properties and other net tangible and intangible assets. The resulting goodwill was amortised over a period of 10 years, approximating the life of the mine. A portion of the equity method goodwill (attributable to the period when the investment in GCM was accounted for under the equity method as disclosed inUS GAAP adjustments) was written off in prior periods due to an other than temporary decline in the market value of GCM.
 
Because of a prolonged period of low US dollar gold prices as well as a reduction in exploration expenditure in Australia, GCM reviewed asset carrying values for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 and recorded an impairment loss. As a result of the write-downs taken by GCM, the consolidated entity also reviewed the asset carrying values for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 by estimating future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the assets' use at the lowest level (mine property) at which identifiable cash flows are generated. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering mine plans. As the future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying values of the assets, an impairment was considered to exist. The resulting impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying values exceed the fair values of the impaired assets. Goodwill was allocated to the acquired assets tested for recoverability on a pro-rata basis using their relative fair values. As quoted market prices were not available, fair values were determined based on the future cash flows from each mine property discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks. For US GAAP purposes, a $104.2 million write-down of goodwill was made on 30 June 2000 as a result of the impairment analysis.

US GAAP adjustments
 
From 30 June 1999 to the final phase of the acquisition of GCM on 5 April 2000, the consolidated entity held, directly and indirectly, 57.5% of the outstanding shares in GCM. During this period, the consolidated entity accounted for its majority ownership interest in GCM under the equity method of accounting under both A-GAAP and US GAAP. This accounting treatment was adopted given that, pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, the powers of the consolidated entity to control the operations and assets of GCM were restricted through a clause in the agreement that necessitated unanimous Board approval for all decisions in relation to the financial and operating policies of GCM. This adjustment includes the consolidated entity's proportionate share of A-GAAP to US GAAP adjustments to the net loss of GCM for the period from July 1, 1999 to April 4, 2000.
 
Equity method
 
As disclosed in , the consolidated entity accounted for its investment in GCM under the equity method of accounting from 30 June 1999 to the final phase of the acquisition on 5 April 2000. As GCM sustained losses during this period, the consolidated entity discontinued applying the equity method under A-GAAP when its investment in GCM was reduced to zero. Under US GAAP, the consolidated entity continued to provide for additional losses and reduced its investment in GCM below zero as the financial obligations of GCM were guaranteed by the consolidated entity.
US GAAP
adjustments
 
Equity share of write-downs of associates
 
Under A-GAAP, a portion of the GCM write-off taken on 5 April 2000 (see) was deemed to have occurred prior to this date. Given that the consolidated entity's investment in GCM was accounted for under the equity method of accounting prior to 5 April 2000 (seeUS GAAP adjustments), the proportionate share of this write-off was equity accounted under A-GAAP and recorded in "Equity share of write-downs of associates" during the year ended 30 June 2000. For US GAAP purposes, this amount has been reversed as the impairment write-down under US GAAP occurred subsequent to 5 April 2000 when GCM was wholly-owned.
Goodwill
 
q.    Merger of Group entities
 
During the year ended 30 June 1996, the parent company merged with two of the listed entities in the Group. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") issued a Class Order which exempted the consolidated entity from complying with the A-GAAP requirement to account for the merger as an acquisition by the parent company. This relieved the consolidated entity from having to record the net assets acquired at fair value based on the market price of the shares issued and enabled the merged assets to be kept at their original book values in the A-GAAP financial statements. Under US GAAP, the merger has been accounted for as an acquisition by the parent company of shares held by the minority shareholders of the two controlled entities. As such, the shares acquired are recorded at fair value based on the quoted market price during the period a few days before and after the merger is agreed to and announced. The purchase price is allocated to the fair values of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess purchase consideration recorded as goodwill and amortised over a period of the lesser of life of the mine or 15 years. The resulting adjustment from A-GAAP to US GAAP relates to the amortisation of the step-up to fair value offset by prior year impairment write-downs.

r.    Employee Share Investment Plan loans
 
Under A-GAAP, non-recourse loans granted in respect of shares issued to employees under the Employee Share Investment Plan are classified as non-current receivables. Under US GAAP, such loans are classified as a reduction in shareholders' equity.
 
s.    Dividends
 
Under A-GAAP, dividends declared after the balance sheet date and before the issuance of the financial statements are recognised as a provision in those financial statements. Under US GAAP a provision for dividends is only recognised if the dividends are formally declared by the Board of Directors prior to the balance sheet date.
 
t.    Outside equity interests
 
Balance sheet classification
 
Under A-GAAP, outside equity interests in controlled entities are classified as a component of shareholders' equity. Under US GAAP, the outside equity interests (also referred to as "minority interests") are classified between liabilities and shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Allocation of losses
 
During the year ended 30 June 2000, the consolidated entity allocated losses to outside equity interests for a non-wholly owned entity that resulted in a negative outside equity balance for that entity. Under A-GAAP, where the outside equity interest is a negative amount it can be disclosed as an equity item of the outside equity interest. Under US GAAP, it is not appropriate to reflect the outside equity interests as a negative balance, unless, and to the extent that, the outside equity owners have guaranteed the controlled entity's debt or have committed to provide additional capital. As no such guarantees or commitments have been made by the outside equity owners, the allocation of losses to outside equity interests made under A-GAAP is not recognised under US GAAP. Accordingly, the allocation of losses to outside equity interests has been reversed under US GAAP during the year ended 30 June 2000.
 
During the year ended 30 June 2001, the consolidated entity wrote-off a proportion of the negative balance in outside equity interests against earnings. This write-off has been reversed under US GAAP as the original allocation of losses to outside equity interests was not recognised.
 
US GAAP adjustments
 
Certain of the A-GAAP to US GAAP adjustments relate to subsidiaries in which there exists an outside equity interest. Such adjustments are attributed to the outside equity interests accordingly.

Other adjustments required when considering the significant differences between A-GAAP and US GAAP include:

During the year ended 30 June 1996, the consolidated entity entered into a series of contemporaneous transactions whereby infrastructure bonds were issued and sold, resulting in the realisation of a premium under

40    RECONCILIATION TO US GAAP
(CONT.)
 
A-GAAP as the debt was considered to be extinguished. The conditions necessary for extinguishment of debt under US GAAP are more stringent than A-GAAP. Accordingly, the transaction was not considered an extinguishment of debt under US GAAP as the consolidated entity was not legally released from the debt. Under US GAAP, the premium attributable to the issue and subsequent sale of the bonds is amortised over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method, which did not differ materially from the effective interest method.
 
Larvik Process Technology
 
During the year ended 30 June 2000, the consolidated entity had an intangible asset (referred to as Larvik Process Technology) arising from the acquisition of the Larvik businesses in 1993. This asset represented the value of the exclusive rights acquired to use a patented method of producing zinc dust from zinc scrap. Prior to the sale of the Larvik businesses in June 2000, the Larvik Process Technology asset was not amortised as the useful life was considered indefinite. Under US GAAP, intangible assets with indeterminate lives are amortised over the maximum period of 40 years. The gain on sale of the Larvik businesses during the year ended 30 June 2000 has been adjusted accordingly for US GAAP purposes to reflect the difference in the asset base.
 
Asset revaluation reserve
 
During the year ended 30 June 1999, the consolidated entity booked its share of the post-acquisition movement in the asset revaluation reserve of an associated entity upon adoption of the new equity accounting standard under A-GAAP. The investment in the associated entity was sold on 30 June 2000 and the balance in the asset revaluation reserve was transferred directly to retained earnings in the year ended 30 June 2001. Under US GAAP, this revaluation reserve was not recognised and therefore the profit on sale of the associated entity has been adjusted accordingly in the year ended 30 June 2000.
 
Deferred financing costs
 
Under A-GAAP, the ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings is deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the borrowing. US GAAP requires the use of the effective interest method to amortise such costs, except if the results of an alternative method, such as the straight-line method, does not differ materially from the results obtained from using the effective interest method. As the impact of the difference in using the straight-line method versus the effective interest method is de minimis, no adjustment has been recognised for this difference in accounting.
 
Estimated future mineable reserves
 
The Company provides for mine completion costs and depreciates/amortises relevant mining assets over estimated future mineable reserves of the respective mines. For open pit mines, estimated future mineable reserves are comprised of proved and probable reserves. For underground mines, estimated future mineable reserves are based on the informal resource category denoted as High Confidence Resources.
 
US GAAP requires the use of proved and probable reserves to provide for mine completion costs and to depreciate/amortise relevant mining assets. As the impacts of the differences in using estimated future mineable reserves versus using proved and probable reserves were de minimis, no adjustments have been recognised for these differences in accounting treatment.

v.    Earnings per share
 
Under US GAAP, basic EPS is computed in the same way as A-GAAP by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. The computation of diluted EPS under US GAAP and A-GAAP is similar to basic EPS, except that it assumes the potentially dilutive securities were converted to shares as of the beginning of the year.
 
For all years presented, the potentially dilutive securities, such as the share options and convertible bonds, are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the effect is antidilutive. As such, diluted EPS is equivalent to basic EPS for the years ended 30 June 2001 and 2000.
 
w.    Consolidated statements of cash flows
 
The presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flows in accordance with A-GAAP differs from that required in accordance with SFAS No. 95: Statement of Cash Flows ("SFAS 95") under US GAAP as follows:

x.    Other classification differences
 
Consolidated balance sheets
 
Under A-GAAP, gold bullion on hand is classified as a component of cash. Under US GAAP, gold bullion on hand is classified as a component of inventory as it is sold in the ordinary course of business.
 
Under A-GAAP, all deferred tax balances are classified as non-current. Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of assets and liabilities to which timing differences relate, or anticipated timing of reversal if they are not associated with any balance sheet items.
 
Under A-GAAP, advances and loans made to associated entities are classified as receivables. Under US GAAP, such advances and loans made to associated entities are classified in the "investments accounted for using the equity method" account.

Consolidated statements of financial performance
 
Under A-GAAP, the proceeds on sale of investments are reported as revenue from non-operating activities and the book value of investments sold is reported as an expense. Under US GAAP, only the net gain/(loss) on sale of investments is reported in non-operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, the proceeds on sale of property, plant and equipment are reported as revenue from non-operating activities and the book value of assets sold is reported as an expense. Under US GAAP, only the net gain/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment is reported in operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, borrowing costs (less amounts capitalised for qualifying assets) are reported as a component of profit/(loss) from ordinary activities. Under US GAAP, borrowing costs (less amounts capitalised for qualifying assets) are reported as a component of non-operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, interest income is reported as other revenue from ordinary activities. Under US GAAP, interest income is reported as a component of non-operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, the share of net profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method is reported as a component of profit/(loss) from ordinary activities. Under US GAAP, the share of net profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method is generally reported below non-operating income/(expense) following income tax expense/(benefit).
 
y.    Mining licences
 
The Company's mining licences range between a period of 3 and 25 years, therefore subject to renewal, access to ore deposits is limited to the time covered by the relevant mining lease. There are certain mining leases that expire prior to the Company's assumed ore production that are factored into depreciation, depletion and amortisation calculations, assets impairment analyses, or other accounting results. The Company has the on-going right of renewal to extend the existing terms of the mining licenses. The Company has been successful in renewing all mining licences to date and believes that it will continue to be successful in the future as it is a perfunctory process only to extend such licenses. Hence, the production included in the Company's calculations of depreciation/amortisation of relevant mining assets and mine completion accruals is based on the mine life rather than the license period.
 
41    RESTATEMENT
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated entity's 2001 consolidated financial statements, management determined that an error had been made in the 2001 reconciliation to US GAAP. As a result, the reconciliation to US GAAP as at 30 June 2001 and related narrative has been restated to reflect the following change:
 
a.    Impairment of development properties and property, plant and equipment
 
The consolidated entity's impairment of development properties and property, plant and equipment has been adjusted to reflect the reversal of an impairment write-down related to its Bronzewing operation. Upon further review of the methodology used in the SFAS 121 impairment analysis performed in accordance with US GAAP, management determined that cash flows from derivatives instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 had been

incorrectly included in the calculations at certain operations. US GAAP precludes the use of cash flows from derivative instruments accounted for under SFAS 133, since these cash flows are already reflected in the balance sheet. The impairment analysis was recalculated at these operations assuming a gold price of A$580 (US $300 and the closing Australian/US dollar exchange rate of $0.51 at 30 June 2001). The A$580 per ounce gold price was higher than the average price of the SFAS 133 derivative instruments and as a result, an impairment loss of A$30 million, which had been recorded for the Bronzewing operation under Australian GAAP, was not required under US GAAP. Accordingly, the reconciliation has been adjusted for this error.

Independent Auditors' Report
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Normandy Mining Limited
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Normandy Mining Limited and its controlled entities as of 30 June 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of financial performance, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended 30 June 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the consolidated entity's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Australia and in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Normandy Mining Limited and its controlled entities as of 30 June 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 30 June 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Australia.
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in Australia differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The application of the latter would have affected the determination of net loss for each of the two years in the period ended 30 June 2001 and the determination of total equity as of 30 June 2001 and 2000, to the extent summarised in Note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
As discussed in Note 41 to the consolidated financial statements, the reconciliation to US GAAP as of 30 June 2001 and for the year ended 30 June 2001 in Note 40 has been restated.

1.    BASIS OF FINANCIAL REPORT PREPARATION
 
These interim consolidated financial statements of Normandy Mining Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "consolidated entity") are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rules and AASB 1029; . Such rules allow the omission of certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as long as the statements are not misleading. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated entity's results of operations and its cash flows for the half years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000. The operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year, or any future period. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 30 June 2001 audited financial statements of the consolidated entity.

Otter Gold Mines Limited (Otter) and controlled entities were acquired effective 31 December 2001. Therefore the consolidated operating profit from the acquired entities from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2001 was nil. Loss from ordinary activities and extraordinary items after tax of Otter for the whole of the previous half year ended 31 December 2000 was $8.9 million.
 
 
On 23 November 2001, Australian Magnesium Corporation Limited (AMC) successfully completed an equity raising to fund the development of the Stanwell Magnesium Project. New partly paid stapled securities were issued and allotted on that date. In addition, to the fund raising Normandy converted its loan to AMC of $25 million and accrued interest of $2.6 million into ordinary shares in AMC.

Notes
 
to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited)
for the half year ended 31 December 2001
 
 
The effect of these transactions has been that Normandy's effective interest in AMC has been diluted from 62.6% to 22.8%, and accordingly AMC is no longer controlled by Normandy. Consequently, AMC has been deconsolidated from 23 November 2001. From that date, AMC has been equity accounted in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 1016, "Accounting for Investments in Associates". The effect of equity accounting AMC since original acquisition date, including the effect of any change in ownership interests, has been reflected in net profit or directly in reserves (as appropriate). Where this has resulted in a net debit to a reserve an amount has been transferred from retained earnings to offset the debit.
 
Movements in carrying amount of investment in AMC
 
 
Prior to completion of the equity raising, Normandy provided financing arrangements to AMC, which confer certain rights to subscribe for new equity in AMC. These rights have been independently valued by Grant Samuel & Associates at between $28 million and $61 million. AMC is required to obtain shareholder approval for the issue of the rights. As at 31 December 2001, the AMC shareholder's meeting had not been held, and accordingly the rights have not yet been issued to Normandy.
 
Normandy Mt Leyshon Limited ceased to be a controlled entity effective 21 November 2001 after the consolidated entity's share of Normandy Mt Leyshon Limited (76.35%) was sold for $8.8 million. Prior to disposal, the operating loss after tax of the entity for the half year ended 31 December 2001 was $1.3 million. The loss on the sale of entity was $1.0 million. Profit from ordinary activities and extraordinary items after tax of Normandy Mt Leyshon Limited for the whole of the previous half year ended 31 December 2000 was $10.9 million.
 
The shareholding in Societe des Mines d'Ity (51%) was disposed of in December 2001 for $23 million. The operating profit after tax of the entity for the half year ended 31 December 2001 was $1.9 million. Prior to disposal, the profit on sale of the entity was $0.2 million. Profit from ordinary activities and extraordinary items after tax of Societe des Mines d'Ity for the whole of the previous half year ended 31 December 2000 was $6.8 million.

was allowed on the basis that the Federal Court lacked jurisdiction to make the order. This decision was appealed to the High Court, which overturned the Full Federal Court decision. The High Court held that the Federal Court did have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter and make orders under the Corporations Act 2001. The High Court sent the matter back to the Full Federal Court to determine Edensor's appeal on the merits. Prior to the Federal Court appeal and in order to get a stay in enforcement of the original judgement, Normandy paid $28.5 million into Court and Edensor agreed to bear half this amount if it was paid out of Court to former NYO shareholders. Following the High Court appeal, the amount paid into Court was recovered and replaced by a bank guarantee.
 
During the year Normandy Mining Limited provided a $90.0 million contingent equity commitment under which AMC may call upon Normandy Mining Limited to subscribe for AMC shares in the event that the Stanwell Magnesium Project does not achieve certain specified production and operating criteria by no later than September 2006.
 
Disputes
 
A dispute exists between Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd ("Thiess") and Normandy Golden Grove Operations Pty Ltd ("NGGO"), a wholly owned entity, in respect of a claim for additional and unexpected costs arising from the development of the Gossan Hill Project decline. Conciliation procedures have failed to resolve the dispute. Thiess claimed approximately $11 million in damages. NGGO has made a counterclaim of $0.9 million and made an offer of $2.1 million. Litigation in the Supreme Court of Western Australia is proceeding.
 
Disputes exist between a controlled entity, Banff Resources Ltd, and a third party in respect of a claim for part-ownership in the Kilembe mine. The third party has lodged a claim for specific performance and damages with courts in Uganda and Canada. The disputes are currently awaiting hearing and the controlled entity intends to defend the action.
 
Orica Australia Limited has commenced proceedings against a former controlled entity Normandy Industrial Minerals Limited ("NIML"), in respect of the supply of sand used in the manufacture of paints. A controlled entity has indemnified the purchaser of NIML in respect of this claim.
 
Disputes exist between a controlled entity and contractors in respect of the Kasese Cobalt project. Claims have been lodged by contractors for additional payment in respect of extensions of time and additional costs. Claims have either been settled, or are subject to arbitrary proceeding, or are being evaluated.

agreed to make an additional payment of US$3.6 million to Inmet Mining Corporation in relation to the purchase of its interest in Autin Investments BV, contingent upon certain conditions relating to production at the Ovacik Mine, being met.
 
A wholly owned entity has agreed to purchase all the shares in Normandy Anglo Pte Ltd and Normandy Anglo Asia Pty Ltd from Amcorp Exploration (South-East Asia) Limited (Amcorp) under the following terms and conditions, US$1.5 million paid upon the completion of a Bankable Feasibility Study, US$2.5 million paid upon the commencement of commercial production in a designated area, US$2.50 per ounce for the first 200,000 ounces sold by Normandy and thereafter US$5.00 for every ounce sold by Normandy after the initial 200,000 ounces. Normandy Mining Limited has also contracted to make payments for exploration based on the production and exploration results of a controlled entity.
 
 
Normandy Mining Limited and several of its wholly owned entities have provided guarantees over a fully drawn financing facility provided by an Australian bank to Australian Magnesium Corporation Limited (AMC) totalling $72 million. This facility was used by AMC in part to repay a fully drawn $38.6M bank facility and reduce foreign currency hedging obligations provided by a syndicate of banks.
 
Wholly owned entities continue to provide guarantees over the treasury obligations of other wholly owned entities. As at 31 December 2001 the marked to market deferred losses in respect of these obligations decreased to $419 million as compared to $510 million at 30 June 2001.
 
 
A wholly owned entity of Normandy Mining Limited has agreed to subscribe for $100 million of shares in AMC between 31 October 2002 and 31 January 2003. Normandy Mining Limited has guaranteed the performance of the obligation by the wholly owned entity.

Under certain predetermined circumstances, Normandy Mining Limited has agreed to pay $38.3 million to NMC as a compensating amount in relation to costs, expenses and damages incurred by NMC in respect of its takeover offer for the company. Normandy Mining Limited has also indemnified the ANZ Banking Group (ANZ) in respect of a bank guarantee issued by the ANZ to NMC to secure this arrangement.
 
A controlled entity of Normandy Mining Limited has indemnified various banks in respect of guarantees and letters of credit given for satisfactory contractual performance in relation to exploration and mining tenements. Total indemnities given at 31 December 2001 are NZ$8,035,740 and A$438,000. The majority relates to environmental bonding requirements for the Martha Mine Expansion.
 
During the half year ended 31 December 2001, the Normandy Group engaged advisors to provide advice in relation to the takeover bid by AngloGold and any third party offer. The terms of engagement include fees that would become payable in the event that more than 50% of Normandy is acquired under a higher AngloGold or third party offer. Since the Newmont Mining Corporation (NMC) offer was successful on 15 February 2002 as discussed in Note 9, the fees payable to advisors are estimated at $22 million.

8.    RECONCILIATION TO US GAAP
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Australia ("A-GAAP"), which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The following is a summary of the significant adjustments to net profit/(loss) attributable to members of the parent entity and total equity required when reconciling such amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements to the corresponding amounts in accordance with US GAAP, considering the significant differences between A-GAAP and US GAAP
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated entity's consolidated financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2001, management determined that an error had been made in the reconciliation to US GAAP for the half year ended 31 December 2001. As a result, the reconciliation to US GAAP and related narrative have been restated. This Note reflects the restated reconciliation amount and narratives. Note 10 includes discussion and quantification of the restatement.

8.    RECONCILIATION TO US GAAP
(CONT.)
 
a.    Foreign currency translation reserve
 
Under A-GAAP, the foreign currency translation reserve is not adjusted upon disposal of a foreign controlled entity. Under US GAAP, the foreign currency translation reserve attributable to the disposed entity is recognised as part of the gain or loss resulting from the disposal.
 
b.    Gold bullion
 
Revenue recognition
 
Under A-GAAP, gold bullion is recorded as a sale in the period during which it is shipped from the mine, provided it is either sold or delivered to a gold refinery within the normal time span. For US GAAP purposes, revenue from sales of gold bullion is recognised under Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101: Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements when delivery of third-party refined gold to the customer has occurred, the pricing is either fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. As a consequence, revenue recognised under A-GAAP relating to gold bullion which has been shipped from the mine and either sold or delivered to a gold refinery within the normal time span but does not qualify as a sale under US GAAP is reversed at period end. As part of this reversal, the related gold bullion is revalued at cost and put back into inventory for US GAAP purposes.
 
Valuation
 
Under A-GAAP, gold bullion on hand is valued at contract rates for those hedges it is expected to be delivered into. Under US GAAP, gold bullion on hand is valued at cost.
 
c.    Business interruption insurance claims
 
Insurance claim proceeds
 
During the half years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000, the consolidated entity recognised expected insurance proceeds associated with business interruption claims. This is acceptable under A-GAAP where there is a virtual certainty of recovery from the insurers. Under US GAAP, the recognition of business interruption insurance proceeds is appropriate only when the insurance proceeds are received or a non-refundable amount has been acknowledged in writing by the insurers.
 
Capitalisation of costs
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity capitalised costs incurred during the half year ended 31 December 2000 to restore underground mine access after a failure of a stope barricade on 26 June 2000. The costs were capitalised as they were expected to be recovered by the proceeds from the business interruption claims notified with its insurers. As such costs relate to repairs rather than capital improvements, the costs are expensed as incurred under US GAAP.
 
d.    Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
 
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not traded. Under A-GAAP, gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged transaction occurs.

Transition adjustment on adoption of SFAS 133
 
For US GAAP purposes, the consolidated entity adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133: as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138: and related interpretations (collectively referred to as "SFAS 133") effective 1 July 2000. SFAS 133 requires derivatives to be recorded at their fair value as either an asset or liability in the consolidated statements of financial position. Gains and losses on derivatives, which qualify as cash flow hedges, are accumulated in equity as other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs. Gains and losses on non-qualifying derivatives are recorded in earnings immediately as are the gains and losses on fair value hedges and their hedged items.

133
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities
 
On transition to SFAS 133, a loss of $231.9 million after tax ($238.9 million before tax) has been recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the fair value of qualifying cash flow-type hedges held on 1 July 2000, and a loss of $49.3 million after tax ($52.6 million before tax) has been recognised in the US GAAP earnings for the half year ended 31 December 2000 in respect of the fair value of non-qualifying cash flow type hedges held on 1 July 2000. As at 1 July 2000, assets have increased by $27.5 million and liabilities by $308.7 million reflecting the fair values of derivatives qualifying as fair value-type and cash flow-type hedges on transition.
 
Hedging activities
 
As the Company has not completed the required documentation, designation and effectiveness assessments required under SFAS 133 for derivatives used in hedging activities all derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. For the half year ended 31 December 2001, a net gain of $60.3 million before tax plus a C-11 net loss adjustment described below of $162.9 million before tax, resulting in a total net loss of $102.6 million before tax (31 December 2000 a net loss of $2.9 million before tax, plus an opening transition adjustment of $52.6 million before tax, resulting in a total net loss of $55.5 million before tax) has been recognised in US GAAP earnings. The net loss recognised in US GAAP earnings reflecting the total movement in fair value of non-qualifying derivative instruments of $115.0 million (31 December 2000 $47.8 million), a reclassification of the transition adjustment to other comprehensive income of $26.5 million (31 December 2000 from other comprehensive income of $2.0 million) to match hedged transactions affecting earnings in the current half year and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $38.9 million (31 December 2000 unrealised foreign exchange loss of $48.6 million) in respect of the US dollar debt as described below.
 
The consolidated entity does not recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on the unhedged US dollar debt of a controlled entity in the A-GAAP accounts on the basis that it hedges future US dollar denominated sales; however US GAAP does not permit this treatment and requires the unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on the US dollar debt to be recognised in the calculation of net profit/(loss).
 
As indicated above, the consolidated entity adopted SFAS 133 on 1 July 2000. At that time, forward sales contracts used to sell the consolidated entity's production in the ordinary course of business were determined to qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS 133.

in March 2001, such contracts no longer qualified for the exemption, due to the existence of gold lease rate indexes in the contracts. As a consequence, the contracts were required to be recognised on the balance sheet at their fair market value as of 1 July 2001, and a loss of $130.4 million after tax ($162.9 million before tax) was recorded.
Contracts that Qualify for the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exemption
 
e.    Deferred income taxes
 
Temporary differences
 
Under A-GAAP, timing differences are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred tax assets and liabilities using the liability method of tax effect accounting. Future income tax benefits relating to carry forward tax losses are not recorded as an asset unless the benefit is "virtually certain" of being realised. Realisation of benefits relating to other timing differences must be "beyond reasonable doubt" before they may be booked. Under US GAAP, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to all differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are established when it is "more likely than not" that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
 
Purchase business combinations
 
In connection with a purchase business combination, US GAAP requires deferred taxes to be provided for the tax effects of differences between the fair values and the tax bases of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Deferred taxes are only provided on goodwill when the amortisation of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes in the respective tax jurisdiction. A-GAAP does not require the recognition of deferred taxes arising from fair value adjustments attributable to a purchase business combination.
 
Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
 
Under A-GAAP, deferred taxes are provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries when it is known that the funds will be remitted to the parent (other than through a tax-free liquidation). Under US GAAP, there is a presumption that all undistributed earnings will be distributed to the parent by its subsidiaries. This presumption can be overcome if sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. Unless the presumption is overcome, US GAAP requires the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings. For foreign subsidiaries, US GAAP also requires deferred taxes to be provided on the related foreign currency translation reserve. Under A-GAAP, there is no such requirement to provide deferred taxes on the related foreign currency translation reserve.
 
f.    Investments in associated entities and joint ventures
 
In accordance with the equity method and proportionate consolidation method of accounting, the consolidated entity records its relative share of net profits or losses reported by the associated companies and joint ventures for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Accordingly, this adjustment includes the consolidated entity's proportionate share of A-GAAP to US GAAP adjustments to the net profit/(loss) of associated companies and joint ventures.

g.    Impairment of investments
 
Impairment of investment in associated entity
 
Under the equity method of accounting, investments in associated entities are recorded at acquisition cost and adjusted for the consolidated entity's proportionate share of net profits or losses reported by the investee, dividends received from the investee and amortisation of the difference in the underlying equity in net assets of the investee and the cost of the investment (collectively referred to as the "adjusted cost"). Under A-GAAP, investments in associated entities are valued at the lower of adjusted cost or recoverable amount. Each reporting period, the carrying value is assessed. An impairment loss is recorded when the future discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the investment are less than the carrying value of the investment.
 
Under US GAAP, investments in associated entities are valued at adjusted cost less other than temporary write-downs. At each reporting date, the carrying value is assessed and a write-down is made to the fair value based on quoted market prices (if available) when evidence indicates that the decline in value for a period of six to nine months or more is other than temporary.
 
Reversal of impairment of investment in associated entity
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity reversed an impairment charge during the half year ended 31 December 2001 related to a prior period write-down of an investment in an associated entity (such write-down was not taken under US GAAP in the prior period as the impairment was not deemed other than temporary). Reversals of impairments are not allowed under US GAAP.
 
Impairment of investment in mining tenements
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity's investment in mining tenements, subject to bi-annual impairment review, was written down during the year ended 30 June 1994 because the discounted future cash flows were less than carrying value. Under US GAAP, the investment is accounted for as a fixed asset and amortised on a units of production basis over the useful life of the asset. The impairment was not taken under US GAAP during the year ended 30 June 1994 as the undiscounted cash flows were greater than the carrying value of the asset. For US GAAP purposes, the consolidated entity continues to amortise the mining tenements and assesses impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
 
h.    Investments in listed shares
 
Under A-GAAP, the listed shares are valued at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Each reporting period, the recoverable amount is assessed. An impairment loss is recorded when the future discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the investment are less than the carrying amount of the listed shares.
 
Under US GAAP, the listed shares are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealised gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income until realised. Declines in market value for a period of six to nine months or more judged to be other than temporary are recognised in earnings.

i.     Exploration and evaluation expenditure
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity allows exploration and evaluation expenditure to be accumulated for each area of interest and recorded as an asset (subject to a recoverable amount test) if either: (i) it is expected to be recouped through successful development of and production from the area, or by its sale; or (ii) significant exploration or evaluation of the area is continuing. For areas of interest which are not considered to have any commercial value, or where exploration rights are no longer current, the capitalised amounts are written off against earnings.
 
Under US GAAP, exploration and evaluation expenditure (including the cost of feasibility studies) is expensed as incurred for an area of interest until commercial feasibility is established in compliance with Securities Act Industry Guide 7. After an area of interest has been assessed as commercially feasible, expenditures specific to that area of interest for further development are capitalised.
 
j.     Pilot plant
 
Prior to the half year ended 31 December 2001, the controlled entity AMC capitalised costs under A-GAAP which were associated with the construction, commissioning and maintenance of a pilot plant. The ongoing operation of the pilot plant is not for commercial production but rather to facilitate continued research and development. The capitalised costs associated with the pilot plant will be amortised upon the commencement of commercial production from the full-scale plant. Under US GAAP, costs associated with the design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible to the enterprise for commercial production are considered research and development and expensed as incurred.
 
In July 2001, the pilot plant was completed and proven to be successful. Costs associated with the construction of the full scale plant are being capitalised under both A-GAAP and US GAAP. As such, no further adjustment was made during the half year ended 31 December 2001, as amortisation of the costs of the pilot plant capitalised under A-GAAP has not yet commenced.
 
k.     Impairment of development properties and property, plant and equipment
 
Under A-GAAP, the recoverable amount of non-current assets including development properties and property, plant and equipment is assessed each reporting period. An impairment loss is recorded when the future discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset.
 
Under US GAAP, long-lived assets and goodwill related to those assets is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset (as adjusted from A-GAAP to US GAAP) to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets' use at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are generated. Generally, all assets at a particular mine are used together to generate cash flows. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering mine plans. When the cash flow analysis indicates an asset is impaired, the impairment loss to be recognised is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined by quoted market prices, discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques.

l.    Provision for mine completion costs
 
The consolidated entity recognises a provision for estimated mine completion costs (i.e. rehabilitation expenditure, decommissioning and closure costs) using the incremental method on a units of production basis over the life of the mine from the time production commences. Future total mine completion costs are estimated annually on an undiscounted basis taking into account all current environmental and legal requirements. Under A-GAAP, a material change in estimate of the future total mine completion costs is accounted for in the period the change is made. Under US GAAP, a change in estimate of such costs must be accounted for in the period of change and future periods if the change affects both.
 
m.    Provision for redundancy and restructuring
 
Rationalization of business activities
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity recognised a provision for office closure costs and employee redundancy payments in connection with the intended rationalisation of certain business activities. Under US GAAP, such costs may only be accrued if they are part of a formal restructuring plan, approved by management that specifically identifies the significant actions to be taken to complete the plan activities that will not be continued, the number and job classifications of employees to be terminated, as well as other strict criteria. As all of the criteria for accrual have not been met, payments for restructuring and redundancy are expensed as incurred under US GAAP.
 
Termination of employment contract
 
As a result of the takeover bid by NMC and the stated intentions of both NMC and Mr. Robert J Champion de Crespigny, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the consolidated entity, management believes it is probable that Mr. Champion de Crespigny's ten-year employment contract will be terminated. Termination of the contract will result in a $15 million payment, of which $3.75 million has been accrued as of 31 December 2001 (see Note 34 to the 30 June 2001 audited consolidated financial statements). Accordingly, the difference of $11.25 million has been accrued at 31 December 2001 as a takeover cost under A-GAAP.
 
Under US GAAP, a liability for contractual termination benefits that will be triggered by the consummation of the business combination should be recognized when the business combination is consummated. As such, the $11.25 million accrual has been reversed under US GAAP as the takeover by NMC was not consummated prior to 31 December 2001.

n.    Share-based compensation costs
 
Under A-GAAP, no cost is attributed to the value of shares or share options granted to employees under the terms of the ownership-based remuneration schemes as disclosed in Note 36. Under US GAAP, the consolidated entity has elected to account for the issuance of shares and share options granted to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25: Issued to Employees and related interpretations ("APB 25"). The consolidated entity's ownership-based remuneration schemes are accounted for as follows under APB 25:
Accounting for Stock
 
Employee Share Investment Plan
 
The Employee Share Investment Plan is deemed to be non-compensatory under APB 25. As such, no compensation expense is recognised for issuances of shares to employees under the Plan.
 
Executive Share Incentive Plan
 
The Executive Share Incentive Plan is considered a variable plan under APB 25 as the exercise price is not known at the date of grant. Rights to share options under the Plan vest over three years provided performance hurdles are met. Under APB 25, estimates of compensation cost, measured as the excess of the quoted market price over the estimated exercise price, are recorded prior to the measurement date when management determines that it is probable that the performance hurdles will be met, and adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in the quoted market price. On 4 November 2001, all rights to share options under the Plan vested when the Board of Directors informed the Plan participants of the takeover bids by AngloGold and NMC. As such, the total compensation cost of the share options was recognised during the half year ended 31 December 2001, after considering the compensation cost recognised in prior periods, the unforfeited options outstanding and the quoted market price of the shares.
 
Employee Share Bonus Plan
 
The Employee Share Bonus Plan is considered a fixed plan under APB 25 as the exercise price and number of shares are known at the date of grant. No compensation cost is recognised under APB 25 as the exercise price of the share options exceeded the market price of the stock at the date of grant of the rights to share options.
 
o.    Capitalisation of borrowing costs
 
Prior to 1 July 1998, all borrowing costs were expensed as incurred under A-GAAP. Effective 1 July 1998, A-GAAP requires interest capitalisation on assets constructed for the consolidated entity's own use when the asset is under construction for a period greater than 12 months. US GAAP requires the capitalisation of interest on assets constructed for the consolidated entity's own use (from inception of the consolidated entity), regardless of the length of the construction period.
 
For purposes of US GAAP, additional interest of $2.9 million and $2.2 million was capitalised during the half years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000, respectively. Depreciation of such capitalised interest amounted to $1.0 million and $1.0 million during the respective half years.

p.    Merger of Group entities
 
During the year ended 30 June 1996, the parent company merged with two of the listed entities in the Group. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") issued a Class Order which exempted the consolidated entity from complying with the A-GAAP requirement to account for the merger as an acquisition by the parent company. This relieved the consolidated entity from having to record the net assets acquired at fair value based on the market price of the shares issued and enabled the merged assets to be kept at their original book value in the A-GAAP financial statements. Under US GAAP, the merger has been accounted for as an acquisition by the parent company of shares held by the minority shareholders of the two controlled entities. As such, the shares acquired are recorded at fair value based on the quoted market price during the period a few days before and after the merger is agreed to and announced. The purchase price is allocated to the fair values of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess purchase consideration recorded as goodwill and amortised over a period of the lesser of life of the mine or 15 years. The resulting adjustment from A-GAAP to US GAAP relates to the amortisation of the step-up to fair value offset by prior year impairment write-downs.
 
q.    Employee Share Investment Plan loans
 
Under A-GAAP, non-recourse loans granted in respect of shares issued to employees under the Employee Share Investment Plan are classified as non-current receivables. Under US GAAP, such loans are classified as a reduction in shareholders' equity.
 
r.    Dividends
 
Under A-GAAP, dividends declared after the balance sheet date and before the issuance of the financial statements are recognized as a provision in those financial statements. Under US GAAP, a provision for dividends is only recognised if the dividends are formally declared by the Board of Directors prior to the balance sheet date.
 
s.    Outside equity interests
 
Balance sheet classification
 
Under A-GAAP, outside equity interests in controlled entities are classified as a component of shareholders' equity. Under US GAAP, the outside equity interests (also referred to as "minority interests") are classified between liabilities and shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
 
US GAAP adjustments
 
Certain of the A-GAAP to US GAAP adjustments relate to subsidiaries in which there exists an outside equity interest. Such adjustments are attributed to the outside equity interests accordingly.

t.    Amortisation of mine properties
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity adopted the concept of Future Reserve Potential as the basis for determining the units of production method of amortisation for a number of operations with effect from 1 July 2001 as discussed in Note 2 above. Under US GAAP, the SEC does not recognise additional ore resources beyond the proved and probable categories of reserves which must be used as the amortisation base under the units of production method of amortisation.
 
u.    Asset sales
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity recognised the financial effect of the sale of its 51% controlling interest in the Ity gold mine in Cote D'Ivoire and the sale of its Tasiast exploration project in Africa during the half year ended 31 December 2001. Both sales were agreed with the respective purchasers before 31 December 2001 based on signed Heads of Agreement. Under US GAAP, the financial effect of the sales cannot be recorded until title to the assets has passed which did not occur until February 2002 when actual settlement took place under the Sale Agreement. Accordingly, the financial effect of the sales has been reversed under US GAAP during the half year ended 31 December 2001.
 
v.     Deconsolidation of Australian Magnesium Corporation
 
As disclosed in Note 6, AMC successfully completed an equity raising on 23 November 2001 which had the effect of diluting the consolidated entity's effective interest in AMC from 62.6% to 22.8%. As a result of the transaction, the consolidated entity lost control of, but continued to have significant influence over, AMC. Consequently, AMC has been deconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting from 23 November 2001.
 
Under A-GAAP, the consolidated entity recorded the effect of the change in ownership interest in AMC in net profit and reserves, as appropriate (see Note 6). Under US GAAP, the consolidated entity may make a one-time choice between recognizing the impact of certain issuance by a subsidiary either in the income statement or as a capital transaction in accordance with SAB No. 51: Accounting for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary ("SAB 51"). However, SAB 51 precludes income recognition where there is uncertainty about the future existence of the controlled entity. For this reason, the consolidated entity recognised the effect of the change in ownership interest in AMC in equity for US GAAP purposes. There was a difference in the amount of the deconsolidation result under A-GAAP and US GAAP due to certain GAAP adjustments specifically attributable to AMC, including the pilot plant adjustment in paragraph (j) above and a portion of the derivatives adjustment in note (d) above.
 
Under A-GAAP, the carrying amount of the investment in AMC was adjusted to the amount that would have been determined in accordance with the equity method of accounting had AMC been an associate since the original acquisition date. Under US GAAP, a change in accounting from the consolidation method to the equity method is accounted for prospectively from the date of change.

w.    Other
 
Other adjustments required when considering the significant differences between A-GAAP and US GAAP include:
 
Infrastructure bond premium
 
During the year ended 30 June 1996, the consolidated entity entered into a series of contemporaneous transactions whereby infrastructure bonds were issued and sold, resulting in the realisation of a premium under A-GAAP as the debt was considered to be extinguished. The conditions necessary for extinguishment of debt under US GAAP are more stringent than A-GAAP. Accordingly, the transaction was not considered an extinguishment of debt under US GAAP as the consolidated entity was not legally released from the debt. Under US GAAP, the premium attributable to the issue and subsequent sale of the bonds is amortised over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method, which did not differ materially from the effective interest method.
 
Deferred financing costs
 
Under A-GAAP, the ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings is deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the borrowing. US GAAP requires the use of the effective interest method to amortise such costs, except if the results of an alternative method, such as the straight-line method, does not differ materially from the results obtained from using the effective interest method. As the impact of the difference in using the straight-line method versus the effective interest method is de minimis, no adjustment has been recognized for this difference in accounting.
 
x.    Earnings per share
 
Under US GAAP, basic EPS is computed in the same way as A-GAAP by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. The computation of diluted EPS under US GAAP and A-GAAP is similar to basic EPS, except that it assumes the potentially dilutive securities were converted to shares as of the beginning of the year.
 
For all years presented, the potentially dilutive securities, such as the share options and convertible bonds, are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the effect is antidilutive. As such, diluted EPS is equivalent to basic EPS for the half years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000.
 
y.    Consolidated statements of cash flows
 
The presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flows in accordance with A-GAAP differs from that required in accordance with SFAS No. 95: ("SFAS 95") under US GAAP as follows:

z.    Other classification differences
 
Consolidated balance sheets
 
Under A-GAAP, gold bullion on hand is classified as a component of cash. Under US GAAP, gold bullion on hand is classified as a component of inventory as it is sold in the ordinary course of business.
 
Under A-GAAP, all deferred tax balances are classified as non-current. Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of assets and liabilities to which timing differences relate, or anticipated timing of reversal if they are not associated with any balance sheet items.
 
Under A-GAAP, advances and loans made to associated entities are classified as receivables. Under US GAAP, such advances and loans made to associated entities are classified in the "investments accounted for using the equity method" account.

Consolidated statements of financial performance
 
Under A-GAAP, the proceeds on sale of investments are reported as revenue from non-operating activities and the book value of investments sold is reported as an expense. Under US GAAP, only the net gain/(loss) on sale of investments is reported in non-operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, the proceeds on sale of property, plant and equipment are reported as revenue from non-operating activities and the book value of assets sold is reported as an expense. Under US GAAP, only the net gain/(loss) on the sale of property, plant and equipment is reported in operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, borrowing costs (less amounts capitalised for qualifying assets) are reported as a component of profit/(loss) from ordinary activities. Under US GAAP, borrowing costs (less amounts capitalised for qualifying assets) are reported as a component of non-operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, interest income is reported as other revenue from ordinary activities. Under US GAAP, interest income is reported as a component of non-operating income/(expense).
 
Under A-GAAP, the share of net profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method is reported as a component of profit/(loss) from ordinary activities. Under US GAAP, the share of net profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method is generally reported below non-operating income/(expense) following income tax expense/(benefit).
 
9.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
Acquisition by Newmont Mining Corporation
 
On 15 February 2002, NMC gained control of the consolidated entity, as it acquired 66% of Normandy Mining Limited shares. This has subsequently been increased to 100%.
 
Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC) shareholder's meeting
 
On 28 February 2002, the shareholders of AMC approved the financing arrangement as discussed in Notes 6 and 7 above.
 
ASIC action against Yandal Gold Pty Ltd (refer to Note 7)
 
On 20 March 2002, the Full Federal Court determined Edensor's appeal against Edensor although the Court put a 14 day stay on the original orders to allow the parties to make submissions given the lapse of time and changed circumstances. As a result of the judgement, the consolidated entity may be requested to pay half the $28.5 million plus interest on the full amount of about $4.0 million, although the Full Federal Court judgement may yet be further appealed to High Court.

10.    RESTATEMENT
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated entity's consolidated financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2001, management determined that an error had been made in the reconciliation to US GAAP for the half year ended 31 December 2001. As a result, the reconciliation to US GAAP for the half year ended 31 December and related narrative has been restated to reflect the following change:
 
a.    Impairment of development properties and property, plant and equipment
 
As at 30 June 2001, the consolidated entity's impairment of development properties and property, plant and equipment was adjusted to reflect the reversal of an impairment write-down related to its Bronzewing operation. As a result of reviewing the methodology used in the SFAS 121 impairment analysis performed in accordance with US GAAP, which determined that cash flows from derivatives instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 had been incorrectly included in the calculations at certain operations. US GAAP precludes the use of cash flows from derivative instruments accounted for under SFAS 133, since these cash flows are already reflected in the balance sheet. As at 30 June 2001, the impairment analysis was recalculated at these operations assuming a gold price of A$580 (US $300 and the closing Australian/US dollar exchange rate of $0.51 at 30 June 2001). The A$580 per ounce gold price was higher than the average price of the SFAS 133 derivative instruments and as a result, an impairment loss of A $30 million, which had been recorded for the Bronzewing operation under Australian GAAP, was not required under US GAAP. As a result, the depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment for the six months ended 31 December 2001 has been recalculated. Accordingly, the reconciliation has been adjusted for this error.
