Exhibit 99.1 Newmont's First Quarter Net Income of $117 Million, $0.29 Per Share DENVER, May 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced first quarter net income of $117.3 million ($0.29 per share), compared to a net loss of $8.7 million ($0.03 per share) for the first quarter of 2002. Net income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle totaled $151.8 million ($0.38 per share). First quarter highlights included: * Equity gold sales(1) of 1.78 million ounces at total cash costs of $201 per ounce;(2) * Net cash provided by operating activities of $186.1 million, before settlement of derivatives of $50.1 million; * Consideration of $180 million received from the sale of the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture interest; * Exchange of the Company's 45.7% interest in Echo Bay for a 13.8% interest in Kinross Gold, which had a market value of $266.4 million at the end of the first quarter; * Debt reduction of $156.7 million; and * Reduction of committed hedged ounces by a further 1.44 million ounces. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Newmont, said: "Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our operating assets as well as our largely unhedged production profile. We continue to meet or exceed the strategic goals of improved profitability, reduced financial leverage and increased exposure to the gold price that we outlined when we acquired Franco-Nevada and Normandy." First Quarter 2003 2002 Financial (in millions, except per share) Sales and other income $864.6 $495.8 Net cash provided by operating activities $136.0 $71.2 Net income (loss) applicable to common shares $117.3 ($8.7) Net income (loss) per common share $0.29 ($0.03) Operating Equity gold sales (000 ounces)(1) 1,780.5 1,464.8 Average realized price ($/oz) $351 $292 Total cash costs ($/oz)(2) $201 $195 Total production costs ($/oz)(2) $261 $257 1. Equity gold sales ounces are those attributable to Newmont's ownership or economic interest. 2. For a reconciliation of total cash costs and total production costs per ounce (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Financial & Operating Review First quarter net income applicable to common shares was $117.3 million ($0.29 per share), a substantial improvement over the net loss of $8.7 million ($0.03 per share) for the first quarter of 2002. Net income to common shares before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $151.8 million ($0.38 per share), compared to a net loss of $16.4 million ($0.06 per share) for the first quarter of 2002. The Company's improved performance was the result of a $59 per ounce higher realized gold price (+20%) and a 22% increase in equity gold sold over the year ago quarter (taking into account the February 15, 2002 acquisition date of Franco-Nevada and Normandy). In addition, net income was impacted by a number of non-recurring gains and losses, including: -- a $34.5 million ($0.09 per share) non-cash, after-tax charge to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the implementation of FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations"; -- a $42.2 million ($0.10 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that do not qualify as "effective hedges" and are thus recognized in income; -- a net $68.0 million ($0.17 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain on the exchange of the Company's 45.7% equity investment in Echo Bay for a 13.8% interest in Kinross Gold; -- a $13.0 million ($0.03 per share) after-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt; and -- miscellaneous write-downs and legacy-site reclamation accruals totaling $20.5 million ($0.05 per share) after-tax, including a write-down of $11.0 million ($0.03 per share) relating to the Company's equity investment in Australian Magnesium Corporation. The Company generated cash from operating activities of $136.0 million for the quarter, after utilizing $50.1 million of operating cash flow for settlement of normal and accelerated deliveries into the acquired Australian hedge books. Cash generated from operating activities before hedge book reductions was $186.1 million. Operating Highlights North America Q1 2003 Q1 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 747.4 727.4 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $226 $231 * The Nevada operations sold 632,900 ounces in the first quarter, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2002. Production from refractory ores increased to 458,100 ounces (+16%) due to higher tons processed (+14%) and improved recovery (+2%). Total cash costs were 5% lower than a year ago at $226 per ounce. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 65,200 ounces in the first quarter, a 5% increase over the first quarter of 2002 as higher grades (+45%) offset lower mill throughput. Total cash costs were 16% higher than a year ago at $249 per ounce due to a strengthening Canadian dollar and more labor-intensive mining techniques as the mine matures. * Holloway in Canada sold 18,100 equity ounces in the first quarter, a 35% decrease over the first quarter of 2002. Total cash costs were 52% higher than a year ago at $294 per ounce. Declining production and higher total cash costs resulted from a temporary 26% decrease in ore grade due to stope sequencing. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 16,600 equity ounces in the first quarter, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2002. Total cash costs were 30% lower than a year ago at $128 per ounce. South America Q1 2003 Q1 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 386.9 308.7 Total cash costs ($/oz)1 $130 $142 * Yanacocha in Peru sold 335,100 equity ounces in the first quarter, a 35% increase over the first quarter of 2002, while total cash costs were 9% lower than a year ago at $124 per ounce as tons placed on the leach pads increased (+7%) and the average ore grade increased. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 51,800 equity ounces in the first quarter, a 15% decrease from the first quarter of 2002 as lower grade refractory ore (-24%) outweighed higher refractory ore recovery (+13%). Total cash costs were 6% higher than a year ago at $172 per ounce. Australia Q1 2003 Q1 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 407.8 238.7 Total cash costs ($/oz)1 $235 $167 * In general, the Australian operations reported higher cash costs over the year ago quarter as a result of: -- a stronger Australian dollar, which averaged $0.595 during the quarter (+14% from the year ago quarter), increased cash costs by approximately $28 per ounce; -- higher fuel costs, which increased cash costs by approximately $4 per ounce; and -- reallocated technical service and administrative costs, which increased cash costs by approximately $14 per ounce. In addition, the effective date of the Franco-Nevada and Normandy acquisitions of February 15, 2002, resulted in only six weeks of consolidated results for the first quarter of 2002. This reduces the usefulness of year-to-year comparisons for the first quarter. * Kalgoorlie sold 89,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $247 per ounce (+15%). Higher average grades (+10%) and improved recoveries (+3%) due to improved roaster availability helped mitigate higher underground mining costs at Mt. Charlotte and the impact of a mill maintenance shutdown brought forward from April. The Kalgoorlie Optimization Study, commissioned jointly by Newmont and its joint venture partner, has been completed. The study concluded that, while expansion is not the currently preferred option, there are opportunities to reduce mining costs, improve flotation performance and reduce processing costs. * Pajingo sold 74,000 ounces at total cash costs of $113 per ounce. Higher cash costs (+45%) were due to the treatment of some low grade stockpiled material during the quarter. * Tanami sold 105,500 equity ounces at total cash costs of $257 per ounce. Higher cash costs (+31%) were the result of a lack of feed from a satellite pit due to a ramp failure and higher underground haulage costs at the Callie deposit. * Yandal sold 139,300 ounces at total cash costs of $275 per ounce. Higher cash costs (+49%) were due to lower grades processed (-22%) and higher than normal mill maintenance costs. Batu Hijau (Indonesia) Q1 2003 Q1 2002 Equity copper sales (million lbs.) 69.8 67.6 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 54.3 40.3 Net cash costs ($/lb Cu)1 $0.31 $0.42 * Batu Hijau had another impressive quarter, with a 26% reduction in net cash costs to $0.31 per pound from the year ago quarter, driven largely by significantly higher gold by-product credits. * Copper sales for the quarter were 3% higher than the first quarter of 2002 as higher tons processed (+7%) and higher average grade (+8%) more than offset marginally lower recoveries. * Batu Hijau realized an average copper price during the quarter of $0.76, compared to $0.77 for the year ago quarter. Other Operations Q1 2003 Q1 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 146.4 125.5 Total cash costs ($/oz)1 $169 $163 * At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, 60,100 equity ounces were sold in the first quarter, a 15% increase over the year ago quarter. The increase was largely the result of the timing of sales as production was marginally lower than the year ago quarter. Total cash costs were essentially unchanged from a year ago at $142 per ounce. * At Ovacik in Turkey, 35,000 ounces were sold in the first quarter. Total cash costs were 19% lower than the year ago quarter at $126 per ounce, as lower grades (-33%) were more than offset by higher mill throughput and lower mining and administrative costs. * At Martha in New Zealand, 19,600 equity ounces were sold in the first quarter at total cash costs of $219 per ounce. Total cash costs were 18% higher than the year ago quarter due to a longer than planned mill maintenance shutdown and increased pit wall remedial work. * At Minahasa in Indonesia, 31,700 equity ounces were sold in the first quarter, a reduction of 24% over the year ago quarter. Mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, however, processing of stockpiled ore is expected to continue through the end of the year. Total cash costs were $236 per ounce, 29% higher than the year ago quarter due to reduced production and increased closure-related costs. 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce or net cash costs per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Other Highlights Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents totaled $380.3 million at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, cash was primarily utilized for: -- early extinquishment of debt ($135.8 million); -- settlement of derivatives in the non-Yandal hedge books ($54.2 million in total, reported in the cash flow statement as $50.1 million in operating activities and $4.1 million in investing activities); -- capital expenditures on property, plant and mine development ($81.3 million); and -- an increase in the Company's equity investment in Australian Magnesium Corporation, in line with the contractual obligations assumed with the Normandy acquisition ($56.2 million). Debt Reduction The Company's balance sheet continues to strengthen with net debt to capitalization dropping to approximately 18% at the end of the first quarter, from approximately 20% at year-end 2002. During the first quarter, the Company spent $135.8 million on the early extinquishment of debt, recognizing a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of $19.5 million. The Company will consider repurchasing additional long-term debt on an opportunistic basis going forward and as a result may incur similar losses in the future. Australian Gold Hedge Books In line with the Company's no-hedging philosophy, the Australian gold hedge books were reduced by 1.44 million committed ounces and 115,000 uncommitted ounces during the first quarter. The hedge book reduction in committed ounces was achieved through the delivery or closeout of approximately 515,000 ounces, and the repurchase of approximately 929,500 ounces at a cost of $36.9 million. At the end of the first quarter, the acquired Australian gold hedge books stood at 3.7 million committed ounces and 1.4 million uncommitted ounces, with a negative mark-to-market valuation of approximately $224 million. Three- quarters, or $169 million, of the negative mark-to-market valuation relates to the Yandal Operations hedge book, which is non-recourse to Newmont. Minimum scheduled deliveries for the remaining three-quarters of 2003 are approximately 830,000 committed ounces. As of May 2, 2003, the Company had repurchased a further 1,031,000 committed ounces and delivered 22,000 committed ounces in the second quarter, reducing the committed hedge position to 2.6 million ounces and the negative mark-to-market value to approximately $140 million. Essentially, the only remaining hedge obligations from the Australian hedge books are in the Yandal Operations hedge book. Newmont Capital The Company continues to make significant progress disposing of non-core assets and simplifying its corporate structure. Highlights include: -- the receipt of $170.6 million from the sale of the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture assets, with the escrowed balance of $9.4 million received in April; -- the exchange of the Company's 45.7% equity investment in Echo Bay for a 13.8% interest in Kinross Gold; -- the take-out of the minority interests in Newmont NFM was completed on April 14 at a cost of approximately $115 million, comprising 4.4 million Newmont common shares with a market value of approximately $105 million and cash consideration of approximately $10 million. The Company now owns 100% of the Tanami operations. Newmont NFM will be delisted from the ASX; and -- the successful takeover bid for the outstanding 10.83% of Otter Gold Mines Limited, at a cost of approximately $2 million. The Company has initiated the compulsory acquisition process and anticipates that it will own 100% of Otter by the end of the second quarter of 2003. Otter was delisted from the ASX on March 24. Exploration & Project Development Exploration At the end of the first quarter, there were 92 drill rigs in operation around the world. Exploration highlights during the quarter included continuing positive results from the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana. In addition, deep drilling in the Gold Quarry pit beneath the Dos Equis and Chukar deposits has intersected mineralization that will be further investigated for potential pit expansion or underground mining. At the Ghanaian projects, the 2003 drilling program is designed to convert mineralized material to reserves and to expand the ultimate pit limits at Akyem. The budgeted drilling program may be increased should the Company continue to see positive results. The Company anticipates making a project development decision by year-end 2003. Project Development Development of the Gold Quarry South Layback (GQSL) and Leeville projects in Nevada is proceeding on budget and on schedule. GQSL is scheduled to produce its first gold in the fourth quarter of 2003. GQSL is expected to produce 2.7 million ounces, with annual average gold sales of between 420,000 and 440,000 ounces at total cash costs of between $200 and $215 per ounce over six years. Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $37 million. At Leeville, the sinking of a ventilation shaft and adjacent production shaft to an ultimate depth of 2,000 feet commenced in the quarter. The Leeville underground mine is scheduled to begin gold production in the fourth quarter of 2005 or early in 2006. Over the current mine life of seven years, Leeville is expected to average 500,000 to 550,000 ounces of annual gold sales at total cash costs of between $195 and $205 per ounce. Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $185 million.

Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.
