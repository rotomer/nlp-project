Exhibit 99.1 Newmont Mining Reports Second Quarter Net Income of $90.8 Million ($0.22 Per Share) and Six Month Net Income of $208.1 Million ($0.52 Per Share) DENVER, July 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (the Company) (NYSE: NEM) today announced second quarter net income of $90.8 million ($0.22 per share), compared with net income of $67.1 million ($0.17 per share) for the second quarter of 2002. Newmont earned net income of $208.1 million ($0.52 per share) for the six months ended June 30, 2003, a significant increase from the $58.5 million ($0.17 per share) reported a year ago. Second quarter highlights included: * Equity gold sales(1) of 1.824 million ounces at total cash costs of $212 per ounce;(2) * Net cash provided by operating activities of $177.2 million, before settlement of derivative instruments of $88.2 million; * Committed ounces hedged reduced by a further 3.5 million ounces, substantially eliminating the Australian gold hedge books. The mark- to-market valuation at quarter end was negative $19 million; and * Net debt to total capitalization ratio reduced to approximately 16%. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Newmont, said: "Our first half results reflect the strength of our worldwide operations as we generated approximately $346 million in cash from operating activities before the settlement of derivative instruments. In addition, our exploration team had another successful quarter, and we expect to increase reserves after depletion in 2003." Second Quarter Six Months 2003 2002 2003 2002 Financial (in millions, except per share) Revenues $747.2 $643.7 $1,495.7 $1,139.1 Net cash provided by operating activities $89.0 $126.9 $224.9 $198.1 Net income applicable to common shares $90.8 $67.1 $208.1 $58.5 Net income per common share, basic $0.22 $0.17 $0.52 $0.17 Operating Equity gold sales (000 ounces)(1) 1,823.9 1,863.2 3,604.4 3,328.0 Average realized price ($/oz) $353 $314 $352 $304 Total cash costs ($/oz)(2) $212 $196 $207 $195 Total production costs ($/oz)(2) $277 $255 $269 $256 1.

Financial & Operating Review Second quarter net income applicable to common shares was $90.8 million ($0.22 per share), compared with net income of $67.1 million ($0.17 per share) for the second quarter of 2002. For the first six months, net income applicable to common shares was $208.1 million ($0.52 per share), compared with net income of $58.5 million ($0.17 per share) for the second half of 2002. During the quarter, the Company sold 1,823,900 equity ounces, slightly lower than the 1,863,200 equity ounces sold a year ago. The reduction reflects the January 2003 sale of the Company's interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture and the exchange of the Company's 45.7% interest in Echo Bay for an approximate 13.8% interest in Kinross Gold. The average realized gold price during the quarter was $353 per ounce, a 12% increase over the prior year period. During the first six months, the Company sold 3,604,400 equity ounces, 8% higher than the prior year period. The increase in ounces sold reflects the February 15, 2002 acquisition date of Franco-Nevada and Normandy Mining. The average realized gold price for the first six months was $352, a 16% increase over the prior year period. The following transactions impacted net income for the second quarter of 2003: -- a $11.7 million ($0.03 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that do not qualify as "effective hedges" and are thus recognized in income; -- a net $63.9 million ($0.16 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain on the extinguishment of Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd (Yandal) bonds; -- a net $53.6 million ($0.13 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain on the extinguishment of Yandal derivative liabilities on a consolidated basis; -- a $107.8 million ($0.27 per share) non-cash, after-tax equity loss and impairment of the Company's investment in Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC); and -- other miscellaneous charges totaling $2.5 million ($0.01 per share). These transactions had the net effect of increasing net income for the second quarter of 2003 by $18.9 million. The following transactions impacted net income for the second quarter of 2002: -- a $47.3 million ($0.12 per share) after-tax gain on the sale of the Company's interest in Lihir Gold; and -- a $6.7 million ($0.02 per share) non-cash, after-tax loss for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that do not qualify as "effective hedges." These transactions had the net effect of increasing net income for the second quarter of 2002 by $40.6 million. The Company generated cash from operating activities of $177.2 million in the second quarter, before utilizing $88.2 million for settlement of derivatives related to the Australian hedge books. For the first half of 2003, cash from operating activities totaled $345.9 million, before utilizing $121.0 million for settlement of derivatives related to those hedge books. Operating Highlights - Second Quarter North America Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2003 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 637.1 728.2 1,384.5 1,455.6 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $251 $231 $238 $231 * At the North American operations, increased total cash costs were due to higher royalties, higher costs for energy-related consumables and diesel, and lower gold sales in Nevada and Canada. * The Nevada operations sold 535,300 ounces in the second quarter, an 11% decrease from the second quarter of 2002. Total cash costs at $254 per ounce were 5% higher than a year ago, primarily due to higher labor costs and royalties, lower than planned production from the Deep Post underground mine due to poor ground conditions, and maintenance at the Twin Creeks autoclave that was originally planned for the third quarter. Oxide mill production was lower than a year ago as Mill 5 was idled during the quarter, awaiting ore from the Gold Quarry South Layback (GQSL) project currently in development. Favorable recovery trends continue at the roaster. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 53,800 ounces in the second quarter, a 31% decrease over the second quarter of 2002. Total cash costs were 49% higher than a year ago at $248 per ounce due to a combination of a stronger Canadian dollar and a 26% decline in tons milled due to less flexible, more labor-intensive mining techniques as the mine matures. * Holloway in Canada sold 14,600 equity ounces in the second quarter, a 37% decrease over the second quarter of 2002 due to a 24% decline in ore grades due to stope sequencing. Total cash costs of $310 per ounce were 42% higher than a year ago. Increased cash costs were primarily due to the strengthening Canadian dollar, reduced throughput at Barrick's Holt-McDermott mill and lower sales. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 17,800 equity ounces in the second quarter, a 17% increase over the second quarter of 2002 due to the additional investment in mining equipment. Total cash costs at $201 per ounce were 12% more than a year ago. * Mesquite in California sold 15,600 ounces at total cash costs of $153 per ounce. An agreement to sell the Mesquite operations to Western Goldfields was entered into on July 3, 2003. South America Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2003 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 392.6 311.8 779.5 620.5 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $127 $142 $129 $142 * Yanacocha in Peru had an outstanding quarter. Productivity improvements achieved through Newmont's Gold Medal Performance program resulted in record quarterly production. * Yanacocha sold 343,700 equity ounces in the second quarter, a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2002. Total cash costs at $118 per ounce were 16% lower than a year ago as tons placed on the leach pads increased (+12%) along with the average grade placed on the leach pads (+19%). * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 48,900 equity ounces in the second quarter, a 26% decrease from the second quarter of 2002 due to the processing of lower grade (-25%) refractory ore, lower recoveries and reduced tonnage placed on the leach pads (-25%) as the mine approaches closure. Total cash costs at $188 per ounce were 29% higher than a year ago, driven largely by higher consumable use, mill maintenance costs and decreased ounces from lower ore grades. Australia Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2003 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 530.6 457.6 938.4 696.3 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $242 $196 $239 $186 * The Australian operations continue to experience significant cost pressures from a combination of a stronger Australian dollar, which averaged $0.64 during the second quarter, and higher fuel costs. Significant progress was made during the quarter at Yandal in regard to the buy-back of third-party gold hedge and bond obligations. The Company recorded an impairment of its non-core investment in AMC due to ongoing issues related to the financing and viability of the Stanwell Magnesium Project. The Company inherited the investment in AMC, along with related contractual obligations, when it acquired Normandy Mining in February 2002. * Kalgoorlie sold 104,200 equity ounces (+22%) at total cash costs of $272 per ounce (+24%). Higher average ore grades (+30%) and improved recoveries (+3%) mitigated marginally lower tons milled and increased mining costs associated with a deeper pit, higher diesel costs and a stronger Australian dollar. * Pajingo sold 93,800 ounces (+26%) at total cash costs of $132 per ounce (+39%). Higher sales were driven by higher mill throughput (+14%) and improved grades (+23%). Higher cash costs were attributable to higher mining costs, the reallocation of technical service and administration costs and a stronger Australian dollar. * Tanami sold 190,700 ounces (+45%) at total cash costs of $232 per ounce (+17%). Higher cash costs were attributable to increased royalties (as a result of higher gold prices) and a stronger Australian dollar. Effective April 2003, Newmont owns 100% of the Tanami operations. * Yandal sold 141,900 ounces (-15%) at total cash costs of $305 per ounce (+34%). Lower sales were driven by lower head grades (-19%) and lower recoveries (-4%). Batu Hijau (Indonesia) Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2003 2002 2003 2002 Equity copper sales (m lbs.) 91.2 89.3 161.0 156.9 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 91.9 63.0 146.2 103.3 Net cash costs ($/lb Cu) $0.21 $0.31 $0.25 $0.36 * Batu Hijau in Indonesia had another impressive quarter. Net cash costs were $0.21 per pound, a 32% reduction from the year ago quarter, driven by significantly higher gold by-product credits, lower treatment and refining charges and continuing favorable grade reconciliations. * Copper sales for the second quarter were 2% higher than the year ago quarter as improved copper grades (+7%) more than offset reduced throughput (-7%) as a result of processing harder ore types. The realized copper price for the second quarter was $0.77, compared to $0.75 for the year ago quarter. * Batu Hijau repaid $130.1 million in Senior Debt principal during the quarter. Other Operations Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2003 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 166.9 178.6 313.3 304.1 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $175 $144 $172 $152 * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 61,600 equity ounces (-14%) at total cash costs of $150 per ounce (+6%). Decreased sales and higher unit cash costs were driven by lower grade ore (-17%) placed on the leach pads. * Ovacik in Turkey sold 51,200 ounces (+64%) due to increased throughput (+64%), as the mine delivered additional ore from a new pit extension, and improved recoveries (+3%), despite processing lower ore grades (-6%). Total cash costs were slightly higher than the year ago quarter at $123 per ounce. * Martha in New Zealand sold 27,700 equity ounces (-14%) at total cash costs of $237 per ounce. Lower sales were driven by lower grade ore (-33%) processed. Significantly higher total cash costs (+128%) were driven by higher power costs, increased consumption of grinding media and other consumables, and a stronger New Zealand dollar (which increased total cash costs by approximately $47 per ounce). * Minahasa in Indonesia sold 26,400 equity ounces (-40%). Mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, but processing of stockpiled ore is expected to continue through the second quarter of 2004. Total cash costs were $267 per ounce (+38%) due to reduced production as grades processed declined (-35%). 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce or net cash costs per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Other Highlights Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents totaled $274.7 million at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, cash was utilized for: -- the settlement of derivative obligations ($113.3 million in total, reported in the cash flow statement as $88.2 million in operating activities and $25.1 million in investing activities); -- capital expenditures on property, plant and mine development ($134.0 million); and -- payment of dividends ($16.2 million). Debt Reduction The Company's balance sheet continues to strengthen, with the net debt to total capitalization ratio decreasing to approximately 16% at the end of the second quarter (from 18% at the end of the first quarter and 20% at the end of 2002), primarily from the Yandal debt restructuring. Australian Gold Hedge Books The Company substantially eliminated the Australian gold hedge books during the quarter. Committed ounces were reduced by 3.5 million ounces through closeouts or scheduled maturities (0.6 million ounces) and the acquisition of the majority of the Yandal gold hedge book (2.9 million ounces). At the end of the second quarter, the Australian gold hedge books had been reduced to 195,000 committed ounces and 633,000 uncommitted ounces. The mark- to-market valuation was negative $19 million, of which $11 million related to the Yandal hedge book. Yandal During the second quarter, the Company offered to purchase the outstanding Yandal bonds it did not already own (approximately $237.2 million) and Yandal's gold hedge book obligations (which had a negative mark-to-market value of approximately $203 million at May 22, 2003) at a discount of 50%. The tender offers have now expired, with 99.9% of the bondholders and six out of seven hedge counterparties (representing 94% of the committed ounces in the Yandal gold hedge book) accepting the Company's offer. Despite the success of the tender offers, the Yandal Board of Directors resolved to place Yandal into voluntary administration (a form of insolvency proceeding in Australia) on July 3, 2003, as they were of the opinion that Yandal was insolvent, or likely to become insolvent. In conjunction with the voluntary administration process, Newmont made an offer to the administrator for Yandal that, if accepted, would bring Yandal out of voluntary administration and return it to the control of the Yandal board of directors. The Company expects that this process will be completed by the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Newmont Capital The Company continued its program of portfolio optimization. During the quarter, Newmont Capital: -- completed the acquisition of the minority interests in two subsidiaries, Newmont NFM and Otter Gold Mines Limited; -- negotiated to sell Newmont's non-core Mesquite property in California to Western Goldfields (as announced by Western Goldfields on July 15, 2003). The transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter; and -- continued to manage the Company's investment portfolio, which had a market value at the end of the second quarter of approximately $300 million, including an investment in Kinross Gold of approximately $291 million. The Company will continue to monitor the market value of its investment in Kinross Gold. Newmont Capital also manages the Company's royalty business. For the quarter, royalty revenues totaled $10.5 million, compared with $11.2 million for the year ago quarter. For the six months, royalty revenues totaled $24.9 million, significantly higher than the $15 million for the first six months of 2002, due to higher gold, oil and gas prices and the February 15, 2002 acquisition date of Franco-Nevada. Exploration & Project Development Exploration At the end of the second quarter, there were 83 drill rigs in operation around the world. Exploration highlights during the quarter included continuing positive results in Nevada and at the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana. In Nevada, exploration and development drilling results indicate excellent reserve addition potential at the GQSL/Dos Equis Layback at Carlin and the Twin Creeks Sage Layback (north Mega Pit). New mineralization intersected at the Chukar underground mine, adjacent to the Gold Quarry pit, is being investigated for underground mining and/or open pit expansion potential. Drilling in Nevada during the quarter totaled 168,000 feet in 367 holes. At Ahafo in Ghana, reserve extension drilling is in progress at 10 of 11 reserve pits, with positive drill results across the trend. The Company continues to enhance the feasibility studies at Akyem and Ahafo, based on significantly larger reserves than originally contemplated. The Company anticipates making a development decision on the Ghana projects by year-end 2003, pending finalization of a foreign investment contract with the government of Ghana. Project Development Development of the GQSL and Leeville projects in Nevada is proceeding on budget and on schedule. GQSL is expected to produce its first gold in the fourth quarter of 2003 or early in 2004. At Leeville, the sinking of a ventilation shaft and adjacent production shaft to an ultimate depth of 2,000 feet continues. Leeville is expected to begin gold production in the fourth quarter of 2005 or early in 2006. At Twin Creeks, stripping will commence next month at the Section 30 Layback (south Mega Pit). The Section 30 Layback is expected to produce 1.6 million ounces of gold over a six-year mine life at total cash costs of between $210 and $220 per ounce. Production is expected to begin in 2005. Capital costs are estimated at $20 million. Updated 2003 Forecast The Company has updated its 2003 Forecast (refer to Forecast Table). In summary, equity gold sales are projected to increase from between 7.1 million and 7.3 million ounces to between 7.2 million and 7.4 million ounces. Total cash costs are projected to increase from between $195 and $200 per ounce to between $198 and $208 per ounce. Significant changes to the previous forecast include: -- in Nevada, an expected increase in total cash costs of approximately $8 per ounce. Forecasted sales remain unchanged at 2.55 million ounces; -- at Yanacocha, an expected increase of 85,000 equity ounces sold to 1,385,000 equity ounces, at lower total cash costs of $117 per ounce; -- in Australia, an expected increase in total cash costs of approximately $20 per ounce. Forecasted sales remain unchanged at between 1.85 and 1.9 million ounces; and -- at Batu Hijau, an expected decrease in net cash costs of $0.02 per pound to between $0.26 and $0.28 per pound. Forecasted copper sales remain unchanged at between 340 million and 360 million equity pounds; forecasted equity gold sales increased from 275,000 ounces to 290,000 ounces.

Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.
