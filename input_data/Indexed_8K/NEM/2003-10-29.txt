Exhibit 99.1 Newmont Mining Announces Third Quarter Net Income of $114.4 Million ($0.28 per share) and Nine Month Net Income of $322.5 Million ($0.80 per share, basic) DENVER, Oct. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (the Company) (NYSE: NEM) today announced third quarter net income applicable to common shares of $114.4 million ($0.28 per share), a 450% increase from the net income of $20.8 million ($0.05 per share) for the third quarter of 2002. Newmont earned net income of $322.5 million ($0.80 per share, basic) for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, a 307% increase from the $79.2 million ($0.22 per share) for the year-ago period. Third quarter highlights include: * Equity gold sales(1) of 2.06 million ounces at total cash costs of $201 per ounce;(2) * Net cash provided by operating activities of $209.5 million; and * Net debt to total capitalization reduced to approximately 13%, with cash and cash equivalents of $419.4 million at the end of the third quarter. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Newmont, said: "Newmont's outstanding third quarter results are further evidence of the strength of our portfolio of core operating assets. Higher gold prices and significantly higher margins are being reflected in strong bottom-line earnings per share growth. For the full year, we expect to be at the higher end of our previous gold sales forecast of between 7.2 million and 7.4 million ounces."

Financial & Operating Review Third quarter net income applicable to common shares was $114.4 million ($0.28 per share), compared with net income of $20.8 million ($0.05 per share) for the third quarter of 2002. For the first nine months, net income applicable to common shares was $322.5 million ($0.80 per share, basic) compared with net income of $79.2 million ($0.22 per share) for the first nine months of 2002. During the third quarter, the Company sold 2,064,100 equity ounces of gold, essentially unchanged from the 2,088,000 equity ounces sold a year ago. The quarter saw strong performance at the Company's core operations in Nevada, Australia, Yanacocha and Batu Hijau. In particular, Yanacocha had an exceptional quarter with equity gold sales of 451,200 ounces, a 37% increase over the year ago quarter, at total cash costs of $113 per ounce. At Batu Hijau, net cash costs were $0.10 per pound, a record low, as higher ore grades were processed (due to the planned mining sequence) and higher gold by-product credits were received. The average realized gold price for the third quarter was $366 per ounce, a 16% increase over the prior year period. During the first nine months, the Company sold 5,668,500 equity ounces of gold, 5% higher than the prior year period. The increase in ounces sold largely reflects the February 15, 2002 acquisition date of Franco-Nevada and Normandy Mining, as well as higher gold sales from Yanacocha. The average realized gold price for the first nine months was $357 per ounce, a 16% increase over the prior year period. The Company generated cash from operating activities of $209.5 million in the third quarter. For the first nine months, cash from operating activities totaled $555.4 million, before utilizing $121.0 million for the settlement of effective derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges. The following items impacted net income for the third quarter of 2003: -- a net $13.6 million ($0.03 per share) after-tax loss on investments, primarily related to the sale of 28 million shares of Kinross Gold; -- a $32.8 million ($0.08 per share), after-tax loss for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that do not qualify as _effective hedges_ and are thus recognized in income; -- a $14.5 million ($0.04 per share) after-tax gain on the extinguishment of Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd (NYOL) bonds; -- a $20.9 million ($0.05 per share) after-tax gain on the extinguishment of NYOL derivative liabilities; and -- other miscellaneous charges totaling $3.0 million, after-tax ($0.01 per share). These items had the net effect of reducing net income by $14.0 million ($0.03 per share). Operating Highlights - Third Quarter North America Q3 2003 Q3 2002 YTD 2003 YTD 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 786.2 836.4 2,170.7 2,292.0 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $239 $222 $238 $228 * At the North American operations, third quarter gold sales of 786,200 ounces were 6% lower than the year ago quarter due to marginally lower gold sales from Nevada and a 25% decline in gold sales from the Canadian operations. * The Nevada operations sold 696,900 ounces in the third quarter, a 3% decrease from the third quarter of 2002. Total cash costs of $240 per ounce were 7% higher than a year ago, primarily attributable to higher reagent costs and contractor costs, as well as higher cost production from the Deep Post underground mine due to the ongoing ground remediation efforts. Recoveries at the roaster and autoclaves were excellent, averaging 91% in the third quarter compared to 86% in the year ago quarter. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 42,800 ounces in the third quarter (-29%) as a result of fewer ore stopes. Total cash costs were 10% higher than a year ago at $238 per ounce due to a stronger Canadian dollar and a 41% decline in tons milled, partially offset by a 55% improvement in ore grades processed. * Holloway in Canada sold 17,400 equity ounces in the third quarter (-13%) due to an expected decline in ore grades (-20%). Total cash costs of $297 per ounce were 84% higher than a year ago. Cash costs were impacted by a stronger Canadian dollar, a 13% decrease in tons mined and lower sales due to lower ore grades processed. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 16,500 equity ounces in the third quarter (-7%) due to slower than anticipated leach recoveries. Total cash costs of $181 per ounce were 7% higher than a year ago due to lower gold sales. * Mesquite in California sold 12,600 ounces at total cash costs of $196 per ounce. An agreement to sell the Mesquite operations to Western Goldfields was entered into in July 2003 and this transaction is now expected to close in November. South America Q3 2003 Q3 2002 YTD 2003 YTD 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 495.0 394.5 1,274.5 1,015.0 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $121 $124 $125 $135 * Yanacocha in Peru had an exceptional quarter, selling a record 451,200 equity ounces (+37%) at total cash costs of $113 per ounce (-5%). Higher grade ores (+18%), quicker leach recoveries from the recently completed Carachugo leach pad expansion and the installation of additional carbon columns contributed to record gold sales in the third quarter. Equity gold sales are, however, likely to be lower in the fourth quarter. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 43,800 equity ounces (-33%) as the mine approaches closure. Kori Kollo processed lower grade ores (-19%) and mined 71% less tons compared to the year ago quarter. As a result, total cash costs at $199 per ounce were 31% higher than a year ago. Australia Q3 2003 Q3 2002 YTD 2003 YTD 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 511.8 475.3 1,450.2 1,171.6 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $235 $201 $237 $192 * At the Australian operations, third quarter gold sales of 511,800 ounces were up 8% from the year ago quarter, with increased sales at Kalgoorlie, Pajingo and Tanami. Cash costs at $235 per ounce were up 17%, largely due to the impact of a stronger Australian dollar, which has risen approximately 25% against the U.S. dollar over the past 12 months. * Kalgoorlie sold 116,000 equity ounces (+23%) at total cash costs of $266 per ounce (+19%). Higher average ore grades (+12%), increased mill throughput (+11%) and improved recoveries helped mitigate the impact of a stronger Australian dollar. * Pajingo sold 90,900 ounces (+18%) at total cash costs of $128 per ounce (+31%). Higher sales were driven by higher mill throughput (+4%) and improved ore grades (+27%). Higher cash costs are attributable to a stronger Australian dollar and increased royalty payments. * Tanami sold 153,100 ounces (+15%) at total cash costs of $241 per ounce (+17%). Higher cash costs were primarily attributable to a stronger Australian dollar. * Yandal sold 151,800 ounces (-11%) at total cash costs of $269 per ounce (+16%). Lower sales were primarily the result of lower grade ores milled at the Bronzewing mine (-21%). Bronzewing is expected to complete mining at the end of the first quarter of 2004. Batu Hijau (Indonesia) Q3 2003 Q3 2002 YTD 2003 YTD 2002 Equity copper sales (M lbs) 103.2 114.5 264.3 271.4 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 116.5 96.9 262.7 200.2 Net cash costs ($/lb Cu)(1) $0.10 $0.24 $0.19 $0.31 * Batu Hijau in Indonesia had an exceptional quarter. Net cash costs for the third quarter were a record $0.10 per pound, a 58% reduction from the year ago quarter, driven by significantly higher ore grades, higher gold by-product credits and lower treatment and refining charges. Higher ore grades in the third quarter are generally a function of the long-term mine plan, which accesses higher grade ores during the dry season. * Equity copper sales of 103.2 million pounds for the third quarter were 10% lower than the year ago quarter as tons processed decreased by 15% compared to the year ago quarter when softer ores were processed. * Batu Hijau contributed equity income of $36.0 million in the third quarter, benefiting from a 36% higher realized copper price of $0.84 per pound, compared to $0.62 for the year ago quarter. Other Operations Q3 2003 Q3 2002 YTD 2003 YTD 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 151.0 162.9 464.3 467.0 Total cash costs ($/oz)(1) $160 $149 $168 $151 * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 50,200 equity ounces (-29%) at total cash costs of $153 per ounce (+25%). Decreased sales and higher unit cash costs were due to lower grade ores placed on the leach pads (-24%). * Ovacik in Turkey sold 51,500 ounces (+41%) due to increased throughput (+45%) as tons mined increased (+66%) due to a pit extension. Total cash costs were slightly higher than the year ago quarter at $128 per ounce (+4%). * Martha in New Zealand sold 26,200 equity ounces (-5%) at total cash costs of $217 per ounce (+57%). Lower sales were driven by lower grade ores processed (-27%). Higher total cash costs were driven by mill liner replacement costs, higher power and consumables as well as a stronger New Zealand dollar. * Minahasa in Indonesia sold 23,100 equity ounces (-18%). While mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, the processing of stockpiled ore is expected to continue through the second quarter of 2004. Total cash costs were $182 per ounce (-30%). 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce or net cash costs per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Other Highlights Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents totaled $419.4 million at the end of the third quarter. During the third quarter, cash flow from operations plus the cash generated from the sale of Kinross Gold shares was utilized for: -- the extinguishment of the remaining NYOL derivative obligations ($26.2 million); -- net repayment of long-term debt ($138.7 million); -- capital expenditures on property, plant and mine development ($151.1 million); and -- payment of dividends ($16.4 million). Debt Reduction The Company's balance sheet continues to strengthen, with net repayment of $138.7 million of long-term debt during the quarter. The net debt to total capitalization ratio decreased to approximately 13% at the end of the third quarter, from 16% at the end of the second quarter and 20% at the end of 2002. On September 22, the Company announced the early redemption of the $100 million Battle Mountain Gold 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures. Payment of approximately $104.9 million in principal and accrued interest will be made to bondholders on October 29. On October 10, the Company announced a tender offer for approximately $177 million of a subsidiary's 8.375% Senior Debentures due 2005. As of October 27, approximately $123.5 million had been irrevocably tendered. The offer is scheduled to expire on November 7, 2003, unless extended. On October 23, the Company announced a tender offer for $90 million of a subsidiary's 7.5% Notes due 2005. The offer is scheduled to expire on November 19, 2003, unless extended. Australian Gold Hedge Books The Company substantially eliminated the Australian gold hedge books during the quarter. Committed ounces were reduced by 195,000 ounces through the resolution of the NYOL insolvency process in Australia. NYOL was returned to the control of its Board of Directors on September 9. Newmont Capital Portfolio optimization efforts continue. During the quarter, Newmont Capital: -- reduced the Company's interest in Kinross Gold to approximately 4.9% through the sale of 28 million Kinross Gold shares, realizing pre-tax proceeds of $224.6 million; -- finalized a letter of intent with a subsidiary of Placer Dome America for a 25% interest in the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture, as announced on September 24; -- advanced the acquisition of Moydow's 50% interest in the Ntotoroso property in the Ahafo project in Ghana; -- sold the Company's 24% stake in the Mt. Woods joint venture in Southern Australia for approximately 13% of Minotaur Resources Ltd.; -- secured a letter of intent with Southwestern Resources for a potential joint venture covering its Liam gold-silver project in south-central Peru. In addition, subscribed to a $5.0 million private placement in Southwestern Resources; -- entered into joint ventures with Adelaide Resources in South Australia, Andean American Mining in central Peru and with AXMIN in Mali; and -- obtained an agreement for the sale of Yandal's Wiluna mine to a management-led group of investors for approximately $2.8 million. Newmont Capital also manages the Company's royalty business. For the quarter, royalty revenues totaled $15.8 million, compared with $7.9 million for the year ago quarter. For the nine months, royalty revenues totaled $40.8 million, significantly higher than the $22.9 million for the first nine months of 2002. The increase is attributable to higher gold, oil and gas prices and a full year of revenues in 2003 compared to a partial year in 2002 due to the February 15, 2002 acquisition date of Franco-Nevada. Exploration & Project Development On September 24, the Company provided updated information on a number of projects that, if developed as currently anticipated, will increase annual gold sales from between 7.3 million and 7.4 million ounces in 2003 to approximately 7.7 million ounces in 2007. In addition, total cash costs are expected to decrease from the current 2003 forecast of between $202 and $208 per ounce to between $175 and $190 per ounce in 2007. In Nevada, gold production commenced at the Gold Quarry South Layback in Nevada. The Leeville project is proceeding well with surface facilities essentially complete. The sinking of the ventilation and production shafts is continuing on schedule. Leeville is expected to begin gold production in the fourth quarter of 2005. Engineering work for a bio-flotation circuit for Mill 5 is underway with an expected start-up in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company expects bio-flotation, an $18 million capital investment, to increase the bio-milling process recovery rate from 55% to approximately 75% and, more importantly, to provide an economic process to treat mid-grade refractory material that would otherwise have been considered waste. At Twin Creeks, stripping commenced at the Section 30 Layback (south Mega Pit) in August. Gold production is expected in 2005. At the end of the third quarter, Newmont had 64 drill rigs operating around the world. Exploration highlights during the quarter include continuing positive results in Nevada and at the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana. In Nevada, exploration and development drilling results continue to indicate excellent reserve addition potential at Gold Quarry and the Twin Creeks Sage Layback (north Mega Pit). At Midas, drilling continues to define a new vein of high grade gold mineralization discovered at a lower elevation than the main Midas veins. In Ghana, positive drill results across the trend at Ahafo and at the open pit at Akyem provide confidence that the Company will more than double existing reserves to 10 million equity ounces by year-end. The Company continues to update the feasibility studies for Ahafo and Akyem and expects to complete the Ahafo feasibility study update in November. Pending finalization of an acceptable foreign investment contract with the Ghanaian government, a development decision for the projects is expected by year-end 2003. Updated 2003 Forecast The Company has updated its 2003 Forecast (refer to Page 12 of 26). In summary, equity gold sales are projected to be between 7.3 million and 7.4 million ounces at total cash costs of between $202 and $208 per ounce. Changes to the previous forecast include: -- in Nevada, an expected $4 increase in total cash costs to $232 per ounce, largely reflecting the impact of the ground remediation efforts at Deep Post; -- at Yanacocha, a 7% increase in ounces sold to 1.47 million equity ounces, at slightly higher total cash costs of $120 per ounce; -- in Australia, marginally lower total cash costs of approximately $241 per ounce, at essentially unchanged forecasted sales of 1.9 million ounces; and -- at Batu Hijau, an expected 15% decrease in net cash costs of between $0.22 and $0.24 per pound. Forecasted copper sales are now between 340 million and 350 million equity pounds and equity gold sales increased from 290,000 ounces to 315,000 ounces.

Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.
