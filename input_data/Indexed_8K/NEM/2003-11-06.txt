Certain Agreements of the Company. The Company covenants and agrees with each of the several Underwriters that, in connection with each offering of Offered Securities: (a) The Company will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b). The Company will file on a timely basis all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below); and the Company will furnish copies of the Prospectus to the Underwriters in New York City prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the business day next succeeding the date of the Terms Agreement or as promptly as practicable thereafter in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will file the Canadian Prospectus with the Canadian Qualifying Authorities in accordance with NI 71-101 and furnish copies of the Canadian Prospectus to the Canadian affiliates of the Underwriters in Toronto prior to 10:00 A.M., Toronto time, on the business day next succeeding the date of the Terms Agreement or as promptly as practicable thereafter in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request. (b) The Company will deliver, without charge to each Underwriter (A) a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and each amendment thereto (without exhibits) and (B) during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of the Prospectus (including all amendments and supplements thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) as the Representatives may reasonably request. As used herein, the term "Prospectus Delivery Period" means such period of time after the first date of the public offering of the Offered Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities by any Underwriter or dealer. (c) Before filing any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus during the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters a copy of the proposed amendment or supplement for review and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. (d) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will advise the Representatives promptly, and confirm such advice in writing, (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective; (ii) when any
supplement to the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus or any amendment to the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus has been filed; (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any request by the Canadian Qualifying Authorities for amendment or supplement to the Canadian Prospectus or the receipt of any comments from the Commission relating to the Registration Statement or any other request by the Commission or the Canadian Qualifying Authorities for any additional information; (iv) of the issuance by the Commission or a Canadian Qualifying Authorities of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose; and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notice with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Offered Securities for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and the Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus or suspending any such qualification of the Offered Securities and, if any such order is issued, will obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (e) If during the Prospectus Delivery Period (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus to comply with law, the Company will immediately notify the Representatives thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to paragraph (c) above, file with the Commission or Qualifying Canadian Authorities, as applicable, and furnish to the Representatives and to such dealers as the Representatives may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus and Canadian Prospectus as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus will comply with law. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5. (f) The Company will make generally available to its security holders and the Representatives as soon as practicable, an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement. (g) The Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection
with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and qualification of the Securities for distribution by prospectus under Canadian Securities Laws and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the Canadian Prospectus and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Certificate of Designations, any Deposit Agreement, any Warrant Agreement, any Blue Sky Memorandum and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Offered Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Offered Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 4(f), including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Offered Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Offered Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Offered Securities and any Common Shares issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof; (vii) the fees and expenses in connection with the listing, if any, of the Offered Securities or any Common Shares issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof; (viii) the fees and expenses of any transfer agent relating to any Common Shares or any Preferred Shares; (ix) the fees and expenses of any Depositary relating to any Depositary Shares; (x) the fees and expenses of any Warrant Agent relating to any Warrants; (xi) expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors; and (xii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section; provided, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 6 and Section 8 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Offered Securities by them, and any advertising expenses they incur connected with any offers they may make. (h) If and to the extent so provided in the Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, the Company, for the period therein provided, will not, directly or indirectly, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of certain of its securities as specified in such Terms Agreement. (i) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives reasonably designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities or to take any action that would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any such jurisdiction. (j) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Offered Securities as described in the Prospectus under the heading "Use of Proceeds".
(k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that could reasonably be expected to cause or result in any stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Offered Securities. (l) The Company will use its reasonable efforts to list, subject to notice of issuance, the Offered Securities on the New York Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"). 5.

The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Firm Securities on the Firm Closing Date and the Option Securities on the Option Closing Date will be subject to the accuracy of the written statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent: (a) On the date of this Agreement and on the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the request of the Company, letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof and addressed to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; provided, that the letter delivered on the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be shall use a "cut-off" date no more than three business days prior to such Firm Closing Date or such Option Closing Date, as the case may be.

(e) The Representatives shall have received on and as of the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, a certificate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Executive Vice President, any Senior Vice President or any Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Accounting Officer of the Company (i) confirming that such officers have carefully reviewed the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Canadian Prospectus and, to the best knowledge of such officers, the representation set forth in Section 2(a) hereof is true and correct, (ii) confirming that the other representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct and that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to such Closing Date and (iii) to the effect set forth in paragraphs (b) and (d) (i) above.

(regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); (x) If the Offered Securities are Warrants, the Warrant Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and the Warrant Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); (xi) If the Offered Securities are Warrants, the Common Shares have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance by the Company upon exercise of the Offered Securities, and when so issued and countersigned by the transfer agent therefor, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and the issuance of such Common Shares will not be subject to the pre-emptive rights of any stockholder of the Company; (xii) The Offered Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus; (xiii) The Company has full corporate power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Offered Securities as contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and all action required to be taken for the due and proper authorization, execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly taken. (xiv) Each of the Transaction Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability and as rights to indemnity and contribution may be limited by United States federal or state securities laws or public policy. (xv) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any New York State or Federal governmental agency or body or any New York State or Federal court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its material properties is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), any Warrant Agreement and any Deposit Agreement, except such as have been obtained and made under the Securities Act and such as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (as to which such counsel need express no opinion);
(xvi) The execution, delivery and performance of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), any Deposit Agreement and any Warrant Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any statute, rule, regulation or order applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of which such counsel is aware of any federal or New York State governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its material properties (other than those that may be required under the Securities Act and under applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which such counsel need express no opinion); (xvii) The Registration Statement was declared effective under the Securities Act as of the date and time specified in such opinion; the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act specified in such opinion on the date specified therein; and no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose is pending or, to the knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the Commission; (xviii) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Description of Our Capital Stock", to the extent that they constitute summaries of the terms of the Offered Securities, matters of law or regulation or legal conclusions, fairly summarize in all material respects the matters described therein; and (xix) The registration statement relating to the Securities, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its date, appeared on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act; nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes it to believe that such registration statement, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, or any such amendment or supplement, as of its date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial or statistical data contained in any of the above-mentioned documents. (g) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, from Britt D. Banks, Esq., Vice President and General Counsel of the Company (subject to customary qualifications furnished to the Representatives), to the effect that:
(i) Each of the Company and each of the Significant Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing in its jurisdiction of organization and has been duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions in which its ownership of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification (except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect), and has all power and authority necessary to own its properties and conduct the business in which it is engaged as described in the Prospectus; (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), any Warrant Agreement and any Deposit Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of which such counsel is aware of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its material properties or, any material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such subsidiary is subject, or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any such subsidiary, which breach or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) Such counsel is not aware of any consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its material properties that is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), any Warrant Agreement and any Deposit Agreement, except such as may be required under the Act and under state securities or Blue Sky laws (as to which such counsel need express no opinion); (iv) To the best knowledge of such counsel, except as described in the Prospectus, there are no legal, governmental or regulatory investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be the subject which, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and to the knowledge of such counsel, and except as described in the Prospectus, no such investigations, actions, suits or proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any governmental or regulatory authority or threatened by others. (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data contained therein, as to which such counsel need express no
opinion), when they were filed with the Commission complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act; and nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes it to believe that any of such documents, when such documents were so filed contained an untrue statement of a material fact and omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; (vi) Nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes it to believe that the Registration Statement relating to the Securities, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, or any such amendment or supplement, as of its date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial or statistical data contained in any of the above-mentioned documents; and (vii) The statements contained in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K/A under the heading "Item 3. Legal Proceedings", and the statements contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the heading "Item 1. Legal Proceedings", in each case, which are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal documents, matters or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal documents, matters and proceedings; and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, (A) there are no current or pending legal, governmental or regulatory actions, suits or proceedings that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Prospectus and that are not so described and (B) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Prospectus and that have not been so filed or described. (h) The Offered Securities to be delivered on the Firm Closing Date or Option Closing Date, as the case may be, shall have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance. (i) The "lock-up" agreements, to the extent so provided for in the Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 and each in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, between the Underwriters and the executive officers (as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) and directors of the Company relating to sales and certain other dispositions of shares of Offered Securities or certain other securities, delivered to the Representatives on or before the date of the Terms Agreement, shall be in full force and effect on the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be.
(j) The Representatives shall have received from counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Offered Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (k) On or prior to the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. All opinions, letters, certificates and evidence mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters. The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Canadian Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; provided, that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter to the extent that the sale to the person asserting of any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial resale by such Underwriter and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to such Underwriter results from the fact that both (i) to the extent required by applicable law, a copy of the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company with the provisions of Section 4 hereof.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter agreed to be furnished to the Company in writing by the Representatives pursuant to the Terms Agreement. (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person,
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Offered Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Offered Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters'
obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. 7. Termination. This Agreement and the Terms Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Terms Agreement and prior to the Firm Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Securities, prior to the Option Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities on the Firm Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Terms Agreement and the Prospectus. 8. Default of Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Offered Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Terms Agreement relating to such Offered Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Offered Securities on the terms contained therein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Offered Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Offered Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for the Offered Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or the Canadian Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Canadian Prospectus which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Terms Agreement with respect to such Offered Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Offered Securities which
remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Offered Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase on the applicable Closing Date the number of Offered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Terms Agreement relating to such Offered Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Terms Agreement) of the Offered Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate amount of Offered Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Terms Agreement relating to such Offered Securities (or, with respect to the Option Closing Date, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase, and of the Company to sell, the Option Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4(g) and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 6; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 9. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters under the Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(g) and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason, other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or Section 8, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities, but the Company shall be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 6. 10. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects, if delivered or sent by first class mail, telex, or facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing by overnight courier sent on the day of such facsimile transmission) to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the
Terms Agreement; and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by first class mail, telex, or facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing by overnight courier sent on the day of such facsimile transmission) to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. 11. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and such Underwriters as are identified in Terms Agreements and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6, and no other person will acquire or have any right or obligation hereunder or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Offered Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign merely by reason of such purchase. 12. Representatives. In all dealings under any Terms Agreement and hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any underwriter made or given by the Representatives. 13.
