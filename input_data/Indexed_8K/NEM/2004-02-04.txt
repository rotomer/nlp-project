Exhibit 99.1 Newmont Mining Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter Net Income of $153 million ($0.36 per share) and 2003 Net Income of $476 million ($1.16 per share) DENVER, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced fourth quarter net income of $153.1 million ($0.36 per share), an increase of 104% from net income of $75.1 million ($0.19 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2002. Newmont earned net income of $475.7 million ($1.16 per share, basic) for 2003, an increase of 208% from $154.3 million ($0.42 per share, basic) for 2002. Fourth quarter and 2003 highlights include: * Equity gold sales(1) for the fourth quarter of 1.7 million ounces at total cash costs(2) of $197 per ounce; equity gold sales of 7.4 million ounces at total cash costs of $203 per ounce for 2003; * Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of $151 million, after net working capital increases of approximately $93 million; net cash provided by operating activities of $589 million for 2003, after settlement of cash flow hedges of approximately $121 million and net working capital increases of $82 million; * Cash exceeding debt by $237 million at year-end; and * Record year-end equity gold reserves of 91.3 million ounces. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Newmont, said: "We ended the year with a strong fourth quarter. Our core operations continue to deliver solid operating results and with higher metal prices, bottom-line earnings more than tripled to $476 million. In addition, our exploration results exceeded expectations and as announced today, we reported record year- end gold reserves." Fourth Quarter Year 2003 2002 2003 2002 Financial (in millions, except per share) Revenues $821.4 $798.7 $3,214.1 $2,657.9 Net cash provided by operating activities $151.2 $225.2 $588.8 $670.3 Net income applicable to common shares $153.1 $75.1 $475.7 $154.3 Net income per common share, basic $0.36 $0.19 $1.16 $0.42 Operating Equity gold sales (000 ounces)(1) 1,715.1 2,215.7 7,383.6 7,631.7 Average realized price ($/ounce) $394 $325 $366 $313 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(2) $197 $178 $203 $189 Total production costs ($/ounce)(2) $259 $242 $266 $250 1.

Financial & Operating Review Fourth quarter net income applicable to common shares was $153.1 million ($0.36 per share), compared with net income of $75.1 million ($0.19 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2002. For 2003, net income applicable to common shares was $475.7 million ($1.16 per share, basic) compared with net income of $154.3 million ($0.42 per share, basic), for 2002. For the fourth quarter, the Company sold 1,715,100 equity ounces of gold, 23% lower than the prior year quarter, largely as a result of lower sales in Nevada and Australia. The average realized gold price for the fourth quarter was $394 per ounce, a 21% increase over the prior year quarter. For 2003, the Company sold 7,383,600 equity ounces of gold, 3% lower than 2002, largely as a result of the divestiture of non-core operations during 2003. The average realized gold price for 2003 was $366 per ounce, a 17% increase over 2002. The Company generated cash from operating activities of $151.2 million in the fourth quarter, after net working capital increases of $93.3 million. The increase in fourth quarter working capital was driven by in-circuit inventory increases and the scheduling of gold shipments. The majority of this increase in working capital is expected to reverse in the first half of 2004. For 2003, cash generated from operating activities totaled $588.8 million after utilizing $121.0 million for the settlement of effective gold derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges and net working capital increases of $81.9 million. Net income for the fourth quarter was impacted by the following: -- a $30 million ($0.07 per share) non-cash, after-tax loss on an inherited guarantee of QMC Finance Pty Ltd (QMC) debt; -- a $10 million ($0.02 per share) after-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt; -- an $18 million ($0.04 per share) non-cash, after-tax impairment charge at Golden Giant in Canada; and -- a $72 million ($0.17 per share) tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances. These items had the net effect of increasing fourth quarter net income by $14 million ($0.03 per share). Net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was impacted by the following: -- a $17.9 million ($0.04 per share) net after tax loss on derivative instruments; and -- a $21.9 million ($0.05 per share) tax benefit. Operating Highlights - Fourth Quarter North America Q4 2003 Q4 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 731.9 932.0 2,902.6 3,224.0 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $218 $199 $233 $220 * North American operations sold 731,900 ounces in the fourth quarter, 21% lower than the year ago quarter, due largely to lower sales in Nevada. * Nevada operations sold 625,700 ounces in the fourth quarter (-21%) due to lower grade refractory ores processed, reduced mill throughput due to increased stripping at the Gold Quarry and Section 30 laybacks, and an in-process inventory increase. Total cash costs of $221 per ounce (+11%) were driven by higher labor, power and mine maintenance costs. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 67,900 ounces in the fourth quarter (-15%) at total cash costs of $181 per ounce (-7%). Lower cash costs were driven by changes in the mine plan, which was refocused on eliminating marginal stopes from the limited remaining mine life. The revised mine plan, along with higher projected life-of-mine operating costs due to a stronger Canadian dollar and higher power and labor costs, led to the impairment charge in the fourth quarter. * Holloway in Canada sold 15,000 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (-44%) at total cash costs of $353 per ounce (+52%). Lower sales were due to lower grades processed as a result of temporary production development delays. Higher cash costs were a result of lower sales, higher labor costs and a stronger Canadian dollar. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 16,900 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (+8%) at total cash costs of $137 per ounce (-20%). Lower cash costs were largely due to improved grades. * Mesquite in California sold 6,400 ounces at total cash costs of $259 per ounce. Mesquite was sold effective November 7, 2003. South America Q4 2003 Q4 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 351.9 411.3 1,626.4 1,426.3 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $128 $119 $126 $131 * In the fourth quarter, Yanacocha in Peru sold 337,900 equity ounces (-4%) at total cash costs of $126 per ounce (+13%). Higher cash costs were driven by increased fuel, labor and royalty costs. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 14,000 equity ounces (-76%) as a result of lower grades processed (-36%) due to the cessation of mining activities in October 2003. The current gold production is being derived from flushing the leach pads. Total cash costs of $165 per ounce were unchanged from a year ago. Australia Q4 2003 Q4 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 439.0 513.0 1,889.2 1,684.6 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $231 $190 $236 $191 * Australian operations sold 439,000 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (-14%), largely attributable to lower sales at the Yandal operations and at Pajingo. Total cash costs of $231 per ounce were up 22% due to the stronger Australian dollar, which appreciated by approximately 28% from the year ago quarter. * Kalgoorlie sold 95,500 equity ounces (-8%) at total cash costs of $265 per ounce (+30%) in the fourth quarter. Gold production was up 14% due to a combination of increased mill throughput, higher grades from positive grade reconciliations and significantly higher recoveries. * Pajingo sold 71,600 ounces (-18%) at total cash costs of $144 per ounce (+38%) in the fourth quarter. Gold production was down 5% as lower throughput offset higher grades. * Tanami sold 139,300 ounces (+4%) at total cash costs of $244 per ounce (+13%) in the fourth quarter. Gold production was up 13% as a result of higher grades processed (+15%). * Yandal sold 132,600 ounces (-29%) at total cash costs of $240 per ounce (+17%) in the fourth quarter. Gold production was down 9% as reduced mill throughput, due to ore hardness, and scheduled mill maintenance at Jundee more than offset higher grades. In addition, lower production at Bronzewing as it approaches closure in March 2004, and the sale of Wiluna on December 4, 2003, contributed to the production decrease. * Golden Grove sold 28.1 million pounds of copper (+202%) and 41.6 million pounds of zinc (+39%) at net cash costs of $0.67 (+16%) and $0.14 (-39%) per pound, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Copper and zinc production for the fourth quarter were both down compared with the year ago quarter due to lower grades and recoveries, partially offset by increased mill throughput. Batu Hijau (Indonesia) Q4 2003 Q4 2002 2003 2002 Equity copper sales (M lbs) 79.1 90.8 343.4 362.3 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 66.2 77.8 328.9 278.0 Net cash costs ($/lb Cu)(1) $0.36 $0.30 $0.23 $0.31 * Batu Hijau in Indonesia contributed record equity income of $21.1 million for the fourth quarter, benefiting from a realized copper price of $1.05 per pound, 36% higher than the year ago quarter. * Equity copper sales totaled 79.1 million pounds for the fourth quarter (-13%) at net cash costs of $0.36 per pound (+20%). Copper production was down 4% due to marginally lower grades and recoveries, but largely in accordance with the mine plan. Increased costs were due to higher utilization of the mining fleet, resulting in higher maintenance and fuel costs, and increased grinding media consumption at the mill. * As a result of higher metal prices, improved operating and financial results, and increased life of mine expectations regarding production, costs and economics, Batu Hijau will begin paying dividends in 2004. This will result in a decrease in Newmont's reported economic interest from 56.25% to 52.875%, in recognition of the 6% net economic interest held by the project's Indonesian shareholder. While the lower economic interest has been applied to reported 2003 reserves, it will only be applied with respect to earnings when PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara, the operator of Batu Hijau, reports positive retained earnings. This is expected to occur in the second or third quarter of 2004. Other Operations Q4 2003 Q4 2002 2003 2002 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 123.1 169.5 587.4 636.5 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $165 $166 $168 $155 * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 46,200 equity ounces (-25%) at total cash costs of $144 per ounce (+9%) in the fourth quarter. Production was down 16% due to lower grades placed on the leach pads (-23%) following depletion of the higher grade stockpiles. * Ovacik in Turkey sold 30,500 ounces (-26%) at total cash costs of $144 per ounce (+33%) in the fourth quarter. Production was essentially unchanged (-3%) as lower tons milled (-18%) were offset by higher grades (+11%) and higher recoveries (+3%). Increased cash costs were due to an increase in mining and site support costs. * Martha in New Zealand sold 35,400 ounces (+6%) at total cash costs of $143 per ounce (-31%) in the fourth quarter. Gold production increased 25% due to higher grades (+12%), higher throughput (+10%) and improved recoveries (+3%). Lower cash costs were due to higher production and increased by-product revenue, more than offsetting the rise in the New Zealand dollar. * Minahasa in Indonesia sold 11,000 equity ounces (-67%) at total costs of $383 per ounce (+48%) in the fourth quarter. Increased cash costs were due to reduced sales and increased reclamation and closure-related expenditures. While mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, the processing of stockpiled ore is expected to continue through the second quarter of 2004. 1.

Other Highlights Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 billion at the end of 2003, reflecting net proceeds of $1.0 billion from the November equity offering. During the fourth quarter, cash was utilized for: -- the early extinguishment of debt, including related fees and premiums ($309.8 million); -- additions to property, plant and mine development ($135.0 million); and -- payment of common stock dividends ($22.1 million). Debt Reduction At year-end, the Company's balance sheet reflected outstanding debt of $1.08 billion, a decrease of $739 million (41%) from year-end 2002. The Company's cash and cash equivalents exceeded its consolidated debt at the end of 2003 by $237 million. On September 22, the Company announced the early redemption of a subsidiary's $100 million 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The debentures were fully redeemed on October 29, 2003. On October 10, the Company announced a tender offer for approximately $177 million of a subsidiary's 8.375% Senior Debentures due 2005. Principal of approximately $125 million was redeemed on November 13, 2003. On October 23, the Company announced a tender offer for $90 million of a subsidiary's 7.5% Notes due 2005. Principal of approximately $70.5 million was redeemed on November 24, 2003. Newmont Capital Portfolio optimization efforts continue. During the quarter, Newmont Capital: -- finalized an agreement with Placer Dome for a 25% interest in the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture; -- sold the Mesquite mine in California; -- sold the Wiluna mine in Western Australia; -- acquired an interest in a European gold refining and distribution business to complement Newmont's existing downstream business in Australia; -- acquired Moydow's 50% interest in the Ntotoroso property at the Ahafo project in Ghana; -- funded a private placement in Southwestern Gold Resources to fund exploration initiatives; and -- commenced a drilling program at its Alberta heavy oil project, located adjacent to EnCana Resources' Christina Lake thermal project. Newmont Capital also manages the Company's royalty business. For the quarter, royalty revenues totaled $15.5 million (+21%) on higher gold, oil and gas prices. For 2003, royalty revenues totaled $56.3 million (+58%). Project Development & Exploration The Leeville underground project in Nevada is approximately 45% complete and is currently on budget and on schedule, with gold production expected in late 2005. The production and ventilation shafts were 405 feet (24%) and 570 feet (40%), respectively, from surface at year-end. Also in Nevada, construction work is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2004 on a bio-flotation circuit for Mill 5 at Carlin, with an expected start-up in the fourth quarter of 2004. Development of the Phoenix project in Nevada was approved in December, with production accelerated by one year to 2006. Phoenix is expected to deliver annual sales of between 400,000 and 450,000 ounces of gold and 18 to 20 million pounds of copper over an anticipated 15-year mine life. Initial development costs are estimated at approximately $205 million. In Ghana, development of the Ahafo project was approved in December following finalization of the foreign investment agreement. Ahafo is expected to deliver steady-state annual gold sales of approximately 500,000 ounces, with higher production in the initial years. Initial development costs are estimated at approximately $350 million and the contract to construct the project was awarded in January 2004. The Company reported record year-end equity gold reserves of 91.3 million ounces, a 5% increase from the 86.9 million ounces reported at year-end 2002. Commenting on the exploration success, President Pierre Lassonde said: "We have said that one of the Company's most valuable assets is its land position of approximately 60,000 square miles. Our exploration success in 2003, when we discovered more than 12 million ounces, bears testimony to this." During 2003, the Company completed a record three million feet (575 miles) of drilling. Exploration, research and development expenditures of $115.2 million were a 30% increase from 2002. More importantly, the Company added 14.6 million equity ounces to reserves, before depletion and divestments, of which 84% was generated through exploration and 16% from acquiring the minority interest at the Ahafo project in Ghana, minority shareholdings at Tanami and Martha, and a 25% interest in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture in Nevada. Another 2.8 million ounces of reserve additions were derived from a higher gold price assumption of $325 per ounce. The largest reserve additions in 2003 were from the Company's newest region, Ghana, and its oldest, Nevada, demonstrating the quality of the Company's diversified portfolio of assets. During the quarter, high-grade intercepts from two core holes at the Kenyase deposit at Ahafo in Ghana reinforced the potential for additional mineralization at depth. Positive results throughout the year at the Subenso, Yamfo Central and Kenyase deposits, as well as at Akyem, contributed to year- end reserves in Ghana of almost 12 million ounces. In Nevada, approximately six million ounces of reserve additions have added significant mine life. Reserves were primarily derived from development drilling on the edges of the Gold Quarry and Twin Creeks pits, adding nearly 2 million ounces in each pit. Lone Tree development drilling contributed over 400,000 reserve ounces and added a year to the mine life to 2006, with residual production in 2007. Results in each case reflect increased grade and more continuous high grade mineralization. Further successes are anticipated in each of these pits, with follow-up drilling planned for 2004. Further, significant high grade discovery holes at Midas, Chukar Footwall and Genesis will provide further drilling targets for 2004. In Indonesia, generative exploration and drilling at a satellite copper- gold prospect near Batu Hijau is underway to delineate identified zones of copper and gold mineralization. In addition, progress continues on the feasibility study for the Martabe project on Sumatra. In Peru, a team has been assembled and work has commenced on feasibility studies for an oxide mill at Yanacocha and for the large, gold-copper Minas Conga project. Given the increased reserves and positive development progress, the Company has updated its long-term outlook. In general, production estimates have increased as a result of the addition of Turquoise Ridge, the acceleration of Phoenix by one year and further mine plan optimization efforts. The Company expects that production will range between 7.0 million and 7.5 million ounces per year through 2006, increasing thereafter. The Company now expects that future total cash costs will range between $210 and $230 per ounce, with the increase largely attributable to increased Australian and Canadian dollar exchange rate assumptions and higher energy-related costs. In general, excluding the impacts of currency movements and energy-related costs, total cash costs are expected to trend downwards over time as older, mature operations are closed and lower cost operations, particularly in Ghana, are brought into production. 2004 Guidance The Company expects 2004 equity gold sales of between 7.0 million and 7.2 million ounces at total cash costs of between $220 and $230 per ounce. Increased cash costs are largely attributable to a stronger Australian dollar assumption of $0.74, higher energy-related consumable costs, lower grades processed in Nevada (as mine plans are adjusted to reflect higher gold prices) and at Yanacocha in Peru, and increased royalties and other taxes as a result of higher assumed gold prices.
