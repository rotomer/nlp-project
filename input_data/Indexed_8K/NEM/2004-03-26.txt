EXHIBIT 99.1 Nevada Roaster Down; Temporary Shutdown of Nevada Roaster DENVER, March 26, 2004 - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) announced that its roaster facility in Nevada is temporarily shut down due to a failure at the oxygen plant. The oxygen plant, which supplies oxygen for the roasting process, is owned and maintained by a third party. An initial assessment indicates a potential three-week production interruption, which could defer up to 30,000 ounces of gold sales from the first and second quarters to the second half of 2004, and result in higher than expected cash costs in Nevada for the first quarter. The Company is using this unscheduled down time to carry out regular maintenance activities at the roaster, originally scheduled for the second quarter. For 2004, Newmont still expects full year gold sales of between 7.0 million and 7.2 million ounces at total cash costs of between $220 and $230 per ounce. First quarter gold sales are expected to be between 1.79 million and 1.83 million ounces.
