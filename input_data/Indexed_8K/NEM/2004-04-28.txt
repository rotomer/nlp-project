Exhibit 99.1 Newmont Mining Corporation Announces First Quarter Income Before Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle of $133.8 Million ($0.30 Per Share) DENVER, April 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced first quarter income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $133.8 million ($0.30 per share). This compares to $151.8 million ($0.38 per share) for the first quarter of 2003, which included a number of items that generated net gains, primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Franco-Nevada and Normandy Mining. During the quarter, Newmont had equity gold sales of 1.81 million ounces at total cash costs of $231 per equity ounce. A combination of higher gold prices and solid operating performance resulted in net cash provided by operating activities of $328.2 million for the quarter, an increase of 141% from the year ago quarter. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Our first quarter operating results reflect higher margins and strong cash flows, demonstrating our leverage to higher gold prices. We will continue to focus our efforts on controlling costs, particularly in Nevada, but we also recognize that higher gold prices bring opportunities to mine additional lower-grade, higher-cost ounces that are value-accretive to Newmont shareholders." First Quarter 2004 2003 Financial (in millions, except per share) Revenues $1,135.4 $748.5 Net cash provided by operating activities $328.2 $136.0 Income before cumulative effect $133.8 $151.8 Net income applicable to common shares $86.7 $117.3 Income per common share before cumulative effect $0.30 $0.38 Net income per common share $0.20 $0.29 Operating Equity gold sales (000 ounces) (1) 1,812.6 1,780.5 Average realized price ($/ounce) $413 $351 Total cash costs ($/ounce) (2) $231 $201 Total production costs ($/ounce) (2) $299 $261 1. Equity gold sales ounces are those attributable to Newmont's ownership or economic interest. 2. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce and per pound and total production costs per ounce and per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Financial & Operating Review First quarter net income applicable to common shares was $86.7 million ($0.20 per share), compared with net income of $117.3 million ($0.29 per share) for the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was impacted by a $47.1 million ($0.10 per share) non-cash, after-tax charge to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect conforming accounting policies upon consolidation of Batu Hijau (discussed below). Net income for the first quarter of 2003 was impacted by the following: -- a $34.5 million ($0.09 per share) non-cash, after-tax charge to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the implementation of FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations"; -- a $42.2 million ($0.10 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that did not qualify as "effective hedges" and were thus recognized in income; -- a net $68.0 million ($0.17 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain on the exchange of the Company's 45.7% equity investment in Echo Bay for a 13.8% interest in Kinross Gold; -- a $13.0 million ($0.03 per share) after-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt; and -- miscellaneous write-downs and legacy-site reclamation accruals totaling $20.5 million ($0.05 per share) after-tax, including a write-down of $11.0 million ($0.03 per share) relating to the Company's equity investment in Australian Magnesium Corporation. These items had the net effect of increasing first quarter 2003 net income by $42.2 million ($0.10 per share). For the first quarter of 2004, the Company sold 1,812,600 equity ounces of gold, 2% higher than the prior year quarter. The average realized price was $413 per ounce, an 18% increase over the prior year quarter. The Company generated net cash from operating activities of $328.2 million in the first quarter, after net working capital increases of $47.6 million, significantly higher than the $136.0 million generated in the first quarter of 2003. Approximately $45 million of the increase was attributable to the consolidation of Batu Hijau (discussed below). In December 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," pursuant to which the Company consolidated Batu Hijau effective January 1, 2004. Previously, the Company had accounted for its investment in Batu Hijau using the equity method of accounting. Upon consolidation, certain changes were necessary to conform Batu Hijau's accounting policies to Newmont's accounting policies: -- a change from units-of-production depreciation of processing plant and mining facilities to straight-line depreciation of such facilities (a non-cash, after-tax charge of $15.1 million, $0.03 per share); and -- a change from allocating costs to stockpile inventories based on mining costs per ton to allocating costs based on recoverable pounds of copper equivalent (a non-cash, after-tax charge of $32.0 million, $0.07 per share). In addition, effective January 1, 2004, the Company commenced reporting cash operating costs at Batu Hijau using co-product accounting because it believes this to be a more meaningful measure of performance for a poly- metallic orebody such as Batu Hijau. The Supplemental Information section of this release provides summarized financial information reflecting the impact of consolidating Batu Hijau on Newmont's consolidated income statement and balance sheet as of March 31, 2004. Operating Highlights -- First Quarter North America Q1 Q1 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 706.6 747.4 Total cash costs ($/ounce) (1) $281 $226 * Nevada operations sold 617,400 equity ounces in the first quarter (-2%) due to a decline in average mill grade (-16%) and unscheduled down time at Mill 6, partially offset by production from Mill 5, which was shut down in the first quarter of 2003. Total cash costs of $287 per equity ounce (+27%) were negatively impacted by higher labor costs, higher fuel costs and higher unscheduled maintenance costs. Production and unit costs were adversely impacted by weather conditions in Eastern Nevada in January and February, which caused a shortfall in open pit ore mined at the Carlin and Pete pits, and resulted in the processing of lower-grade stockpiles during the quarter to make up for the shortfall. In April 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Barrick to toll mill roaster feed through Barrick's roaster in Nevada. Annual tonnages processed under this agreement are expected to vary between 250,000 and 1 million tons. The agreement allows both companies to realize operating synergies and, in the case of Newmont, to process stockpiled material more economically. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 52,700 ounces in the first quarter (-19%) at total cash costs of $245 per ounce (-2%). Lower sales were primarily due to a 33% decrease in mill throughput due to stope sequencing and reduced mining faces at this mature mine, partially offset by a 7% increase in ore grade. Lower operating costs were offset by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. * Holloway in Canada sold 19,200 equity ounces in the first quarter (+6%) at total cash costs of $322 per equity ounce (+10%). Higher sales were driven by a 14% increase in ore grade, with increased cash costs primarily driven by a stronger Canadian dollar. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 17,300 equity ounces in the first quarter (+4%) at unchanged total cash costs of $128 per equity ounce. South America Q1 Q1 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 417.5 386.9 Total cash costs ($/ounce) (1) $135 $130 * Yanacocha in Peru sold 410,300 equity ounces in the first quarter (+22%) at total cash costs of $133 per equity ounce (+7%). Increased sales were primarily attributable to inventory drawdowns, partially offset by lower grades (-23%) and fewer tons placed on the leach pads (-15%), in accordance with the mine plan. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 7,200 equity ounces (-86%). Open-pit mining activities were completed in October 2003, with gold production now derived from flushing the leach pads. Total cash costs of $266 per equity ounce were 55% higher than the year ago quarter on lower unit sales. Australia Q1 Q1 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 521.3 407.8 Total cash costs ($/ounce) (1) $251 $235 * The Australian operations had a strong first quarter, selling 521,300 equity ounces (+28%), largely attributable to higher sales at Kalgoorlie and Tanami. Total cash costs of $251 per equity ounce were up 7% from the year ago quarter. In general, lower operating costs were offset by the appreciation of the Australian dollar. * Kalgoorlie sold 121,900 equity ounces (+37%) at total cash costs of $300 per equity ounce (+21%) in the first quarter. Increased sales were primarily due to inventory drawdowns, a 2% higher mill recovery rate and 9% higher grade due to greater volumes of higher-grade underground ore processed. Increased cash costs were attributable to appreciation of the Australian dollar and higher mining costs at the Mt. Charlotte underground mine and the Superpit. Higher processing costs were due in part to increased maintenance costs associated with SAG mill repairs in January. * Pajingo sold 75,200 ounces (+2%) at total cash costs of $194 per ounce (+72%) in the first quarter. Higher sales reflected inventory drawdowns, partially offset by lower grade (-13%) and lower tons milled (-4%). Increased cash costs were due to a combination of the stronger Australian dollar and higher mining costs. * Tanami sold 183,100 ounces (+74%) at total cash costs of $256 per ounce, unchanged from the year ago quarter. Sales increased primarily due to a full quarter of 100% ownership, increased ore grade (+24%) and a drawdown of inventories. * Yandal sold 141,100 ounces (+1%) at total cash costs of $231 per ounce (-16%) in the first quarter. Increased sales reflected 26% higher grade at Jundee from Westside underground ore, partially offset by the Wiluna divestiture in December 2003 and lower throughput at Bronzewing as a result of the closure of the mine during the first quarter. Lower cash costs largely reflect the divestiture of Wiluna and reduced operations at Bronzewing. * Golden Grove sold 2.3 million pounds of copper (-89%) and 45.4 million pounds of zinc (+82%) at cash costs of $0.46 (-13%) and $0.38 (+23%) per pound, respectively, in the first quarter. Reduced copper sales were primarily due to mine plan sequencing that delivered more zinc ore in the quarter, and the timing of shipments. Batu Hijau (Indonesia) Q1 Q1 2004 2003 Equity copper sales (M lbs) 73.8 69.8 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 56.4 54.3 Total cash costs ($/lb Cu) (1, 2) $0.66 $0.42 Total cash costs ($/oz Au) (1, 2) $179 $186 * Effective January 1, 2004, the Company began consolidating Batu Hijau. In addition, during the first quarter of 2004, the Company changed to co-product cost accounting for copper and gold whereby production costs are allocated in proportion to the sales revenue generated by each product. * Batu Hijau sold 73.8 million equity pounds of copper in the first quarter (+6%) at total cash costs of $0.66 per pound (+57%). Increased copper sales were primarily attributable to higher mill throughput (+4%) and inventory increases in the year ago quarter as a result of the timing of shipments, partially offset by lower recoveries and lower grades, largely in accordance with the mine plan. Higher operating costs were incurred as a result of increased grinding costs due to harder ores, higher mining rates and higher mine maintenance costs as eight additional haul trucks were added to the fleet. In general, production in the first and fourth quarters is lower than the second and third quarters due to the sequencing of increased stripping, and thus lower grade ore delivery to the concentrator, during the rainy season. * Batu Hijau recorded an average realized copper price for the first quarter of $1.50 per pound, reflecting an average spot price of $1.24 per pound and provisional pricing and timing and other miscellaneous adjustments of $0.26 per pound. * Batu Hijau sold 56,400 equity ounces of gold, largely unchanged from the year ago quarter as higher throughput and recoveries partially offset lower grades. Total cash costs for the quarter were $179 per equity ounce. * As discussed in last quarter's release, Batu Hijau is expected to begin paying dividends in 2004 and this will result in a decrease in Newmont's reported economic interest from 56.25% to 52.875%, in recognition of the economic interest held by the project's Indonesian shareholder. While the lower economic interest was applied to reported 2003 reserves, it will only be applied to earnings when Batu Hijau reports positive retained earnings. This is expected to occur in the second half of 2004. Other Operations (3) Q1 Q1 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 110.6 146.4 Total cash costs ($/ounce) (1) $215 $169 * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 55,900 equity ounces (-7%) at total cash costs of $148 per ounce (+4%) in the first quarter. Lower sales reflected an increase in inventory due to the timing of shipments. * Ovacik in Turkey sold 5,900 ounces (-83%) at total cash costs of $302 per ounce (+140%) in the first quarter. Lower sales reflected recently enacted legislation that eliminates refunds of value added taxes relating to gold dore exports. Ovacik has inventoried approximately 30,000 ounces while it attempts to address this issue. Increased costs reflect lower unit sales, lower mill throughput (-9%) and lower grade (-12%), partially offset by higher recoveries. * Martha in New Zealand sold 22,600 ounces (+15%) at total cash costs of $251 per ounce (+15%) in the first quarter. Increased sales reflect higher mill throughput (+26%) and inventory draw downs, partially offset by lower grade (-31%). * Minahasa in Indonesia sold 26,200 equity ounces (-17%) at total cash costs of $307 per equity ounce (+30%) in the first quarter. Increased unit cash costs were due to reduced sales and increased reclamation and closure-related expenditures. While mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, the processing of stockpiled ore is expected to continue through the third quarter of 2004. 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce and per pound and total production costs per ounce and per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. 2. Reflects a change to co-product accounting. 3. Excludes Batu Hijau gold sales, which are discussed separately above. Other Highlights Cash Position At the end of the first quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.55 billion. During the first quarter, cash was utilized for: -- the repayment of long-term debt ($22.3 million); -- additions to property, plant and mine development ($167.9 million); and -- payment of common stock dividends ($22.1 million). Debt At the end of the first quarter, the Company's balance sheet reflected total outstanding debt of $1.91 billion. The increase in debt during the first quarter reflects the consolidation of Batu Hijau, which increased consolidated debt by approximately $849 million. Of this amount, $740 million is project finance debt, which is non-recourse to Newmont, with the balance of $109 million reflecting subordinated debt from an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, which is also non-recourse to Newmont. Newmont Capital Portfolio optimization efforts continue. During the first quarter, Newmont Capital entered into several small transactions, including: -- the acquisition of the La Carpa copper-gold property in Peru, which is located adjacent to the existing Yanacocha land package; -- the acquisition of a further 5% interest in the Martabe project in Indonesia, with an option to acquire the remaining 5% minority interest in 2005; -- the completion of this season's drilling program at the Alberta heavy oil project; and -- the sale, subject to governmental approvals, of the non-core Perama asset in Greece. Newmont Capital also manages the Company's royalty and equity portfolios. For the quarter, royalty revenues totaled $13.2 million (-9%), in-line with expectations. Project Development & Exploration The Leeville underground project in Nevada is currently on schedule for initial gold production in late 2005. The production and ventilation shafts were 780 feet (43%) and 1,006 feet (72%), respectively, from surface at the end of the quarter. The drift from the Carlin East underground mine to the Leeville ventilation shaft was approximately 90% complete at the end of the quarter. At Phoenix, the engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) contract was awarded in March and orders have been placed for long lead-time items. The project remains on schedule for initial gold production in 2006. At Ahafo in Ghana, the EPCM contract was awarded and long lead-time equipment tenders are being released. The initial construction contract for site access and camp infrastructure has been awarded and the contractors are mobilizing to site. Meetings with stakeholders in regard to crop compensation and land acquisition are ongoing. The project remains on schedule for initial gold production in 2006. During the first quarter of 2004, Newmont completed approximately 720,000 feet of exploration drilling, using up to 73 drill rigs. Exploration, research and development expenditures of $36.7 million were 71% higher than the year ago quarter. The guidance for exploration, research and development expenditures for 2004 was increased to between $160 million and $170 million, reflecting increased regional exploration expenses, particularly at Yanacocha, and the consolidation of Batu Hijau's exploration expenditures. 2004 Guidance The Company reaffirmed 2004 equity gold sales guidance of between 7.0 million and 7.2 million ounces. The Company now expects total cash costs of between $225 and $235 per ounce, largely attributable to higher cash costs in Nevada in the first quarter and ongoing cost pressures in respect of consumable and energy-related costs.

Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound (dollars in millions except per ounce amounts) The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.
