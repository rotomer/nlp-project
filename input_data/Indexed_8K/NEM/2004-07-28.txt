Exhibit 99.1 Newmont Mining Corporation Reports Second Quarter Net Income of $37.5 Million ($0.08 per share); Mid-Year Exploration Results Exceed Expectations DENVER, July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced second quarter net income of $37.5 million ($0.08 per share). This compares to net income of $90.8 million ($0.22 per share) for the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the second quarter was impacted by non-cash asset impairment charges that decreased net income by $47.8 million ($0.11 per share). During the quarter, Newmont sold 1.64 million equity ounces of gold at total cash costs of $240 per ounce. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: "The decline in second quarter net income was the result of planned mine closures and divestitures, processing lower grade material and non-cash asset impairment charges. Despite lower ounces sold, cash flow generation from operations for the quarter was $243 million. For the full year, we expect gold sales of in excess of seven million ounces, with the second half's sales weighted towards the fourth quarter. Our development projects are proceeding on schedule, and our exploration results have exceeded expectations, particularly at our two projects in Ghana. We are optimistic about our ability, similar to 2003, to grow reserves from exploration in 2004."

Financial & Operating Review Second quarter net income applicable to common shares was $37.5 million ($0.08 per share), compared with net income of $90.8 million ($0.22 per share) for the second quarter of 2003. For the first six months, net income applicable to common shares was $124.2 million ($0.28 per share), compared with net income of $208.1 million ($0.52 per share, basic) for the first half of 2003. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was impacted by the following: -- a $16.3 million ($0.04 per share) non-cash, after-tax write-down of long-lived assets at Ovacik in Turkey; and -- a $31.5 million ($0.07 per share) non-cash, after-tax charge for an other-than-temporary decline in the value of the Company's investment in Kinross Gold Corporation. These transactions had the effect of decreasing net income for the second quarter of 2004 by $47.8 million ($0.11 per share). Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was impacted by the following: -- an $11.7 million ($0.03 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that did not qualify as "effective hedges;" -- a net $63.9 million ($0.16 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain on the extinguishment of Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd (Yandal) bonds; -- a net $53.6 million ($0.13 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain on the extinguishment of Yandal derivative liabilities on a consolidated basis; -- a $107.8 million ($0.27 per share) non-cash, after-tax equity loss and impairment of the Company's investment in Australian Magnesium Corporation; and -- other miscellaneous charges totaling $2.5 million ($0.01 per share). These transactions had the net effect of increasing net income for the second quarter of 2003 by $18.9 million ($0.04 per share). For the second quarter of 2004, the Company sold 1,643,400 equity ounces of gold, 10% lower than the second quarter of 2003. The average realized price was $395 per ounce, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter. During the first six months of 2004, the Company sold 3,456,000 equity ounces of gold, compared with 3,604,400 equity ounces sold in the first six months of 2003. The average realized price was $404 per ounce, a 15% increase over the prior year period. The Company generated net cash from operating activities of $243.1 million in the second quarter and $567.2 million for the first six months of 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2003 was negatively impacted by the early settlement of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges and does not include consolidated cash flows from Batu Hijau, which was consolidated effective January 1, 2004. Operating Highlights - Second Quarter North America Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 633.7 637.1 1,340.3 1,384.5 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $276 $251 $278 $238 * Nevada operations sold 560,100 equity ounces in the second quarter (+5%), as inventory reductions, increased mill throughput and higher leach tons more than offset lower ore grades processed and associated lower recoveries. Total cash costs of $275 per ounce (+8%) were primarily attributable to processing lower grades due to stripping of laybacks at the Gold Quarry and Twin Creeks Section 30 pits. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 39,500 ounces in the second quarter (-27%) at total cash costs of $277 per ounce (+12%). Lower sales were primarily due to a planned decrease in mill throughput (-27%) as flexibility in accessing available ore continues to decline with the mine's maturity, partially offset by an increase in mill ore grade (+16%) due to more selective mining. On June 28, 2004, the Company announced a temporary shutdown for shaft repairs. The repairs are expected to be completed in August 2004. * Holloway in Canada sold 15,900 equity ounces in the second quarter (+9%) at total cash costs of $423 per ounce (+36%). Higher sales were achieved through a reduction in inventory. Increased cash costs were driven by lower than expected production, and higher manpower, steel and electricity costs. The Company expects to complete the acquisition of the nearby Holt McDermott mill from Barrick in the fourth quarter of 2004. Holloway ore is currently being toll treated at this facility. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 18,200 equity ounces in the second quarter (+2%) at total cash costs of $162 per equity ounce (-19%). Cash costs for the second quarter decreased due to an increase in leach pad inventories. South America Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 323.3 392.6 740.8 779.5 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $150 $127 $142 $129 * Yanacocha in Peru sold 317,700 equity ounces in the second quarter (-8%) at total cash costs of $147 per ounce (+25%). Lower second quarter sales were due to a planned reduction in tons placed on the pads (-7%) due to increased stripping, and lower ore grades (-27%), primarily from the La Quinua deposit. Higher cash costs reflected higher diesel prices and consumption, higher labor and related costs, the increased stripping and lower production. At La Quinua, gold recovery is taking longer than originally anticipated, but the Company does not expect a reduction in ultimate recovery. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 5,600 equity ounces (-89%) at total cash costs of $305 per ounce (+62%). Open-pit mining activities were completed in October 2003 and residual gold production is being derived from rinsing the leach pads. Australia Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 378.0 530.6 899.3 938.4 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $302 $241 $272 $238 * The Australian operations sold 378,000 equity ounces (-29%) in the second quarter, largely attributable to lower sales at Pajingo and Tanami, the divestiture of Wiluna in December 2003 and the closure of Bronzewing in March 2004. Total cash costs of $302 per equity ounce were up 25% from the year ago quarter, largely due to lower production and a stronger Australian dollar. * Kalgoorlie sold 98,500 equity ounces (-5%) at total cash costs of $318 per equity ounce (+17%) in the second quarter. Lower sales reflected the mining sequence and lower equipment availability, which resulted in lower grade ore (-12%) processed in the quarter. Higher cash costs were primarily attributable to lower production, and higher processing consumables and site administration costs. In early July, a shovel was lost following a fire caused by a failure in the fuel lines. The joint venture is actively seeking to replace the shovel. If the replacement is delayed, the 2004 production plan should not be significantly affected, but reduced development work could impact the 2005 production plan. * Pajingo sold 48,600 ounces (-48%) at total cash costs of $290 per ounce (+120%) in the second quarter. Lower sales reflected a ground disturbance during the quarter that limited mining activities and required the processing of low-grade stockpiles. Higher cash costs reflected lower production due to the processing of lower grade stockpiles. Access restrictions have now been resolved. * Tanami sold 158,900 ounces (-17%) at total cash costs of $277 per ounce (+21%) in the second quarter. Lower sales reflected lower ore grades (-15%) with lower grade material being mined at the Granites in accordance with changes in the mining sequence, and lower grades and recovery at Groundrush. Higher cash costs reflected increased underground backfill costs and lower production. * Yandal sold 72,000 ounces (-49%) at total cash costs of $341 per ounce (+12%) in the second quarter. Lower sales reflect the Wiluna divestiture and the closure of Bronzewing. Higher cash costs reflected lower production, higher open-pit mining costs and higher overhead charges. * Golden Grove sold 19.9 million pounds of copper (+23%) and 19.7 million pounds of zinc (-31%) at cash costs of $0.89 (+48%) and $0.37 (+95%) per pound, respectively, in the second quarter. Higher cash costs reflected lower silver by-product credits, and higher development and ground support costs. Batu Hijau (Indonesia) Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity copper sales (M lbs) 106.8 91.2 180.7 161.0 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 111.2 91.9 167.6 146.2 Total cash costs ($/lb Cu)(1,2) $0.46 $0.38 $0.54 $0.40 Total cash costs ($/oz Au)(1,2) $174 n/a $175 n/a * Effective January 1, 2004, the Company began consolidating Batu Hijau and changed to co-product cost accounting for copper and gold, whereby production costs are allocated in proportion to the sales revenue generated by each product. As a result, reported gold cash costs per ounce are sensitive to movements in the copper price. * Batu Hijau sold 106.8 million equity pounds of copper in the second quarter (+17%) at total cash costs of $0.46 per pound. Increased copper sales reflect increased throughput (+12%), reflecting crusher circuit modifications completed in late 2003, improved operational efficiencies, increased ore grades (+15%) and increased recovery (+2%), offset by an inventory increase due to the timing of shipments. Increased costs reflected higher mine operating and maintenance costs, increased crushing and grinding costs and higher treatment and refining costs. The realized copper price for the second quarter was $1.06, a 38% increase over the second quarter of 2003. * Batu Hijau sold 111,200 equity ounces of gold (+21%) at total cash costs of $174 per ounce in the second quarter. Increased gold sales reflected increased throughput (+12%) and gold grades (+24%), offset by an increase in inventory. * Batu Hijau commenced dividend payments during the second quarter and this will result in a decrease in Newmont's reported economic interest from 56.25% to 52.875%, in recognition of the economic interest held by the project's Indonesian shareholder. While the lower economic interest was applied to reported 2003 year-end copper and gold reserves, it will only be applied to earnings when Batu Hijau reports positive retained earnings, which is expected in September 2004. Other Operations Q2 Q2 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 192.1 166.9 302.7 313.3 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $191 $175 $200 $172 * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 68,900 equity ounces (+12%) at total cash costs of $144 per ounce (-4%) in the second quarter. Increased sales were primarily due to a reduction in inventory. * Ovacik in Turkey sold 69,500 ounces (+36%) at total cash costs of $193 per ounce (+57%) in the second quarter. Increased sales reflected the sale of accumulated bullion inventories, partially offset by lower mill throughput (-20%). Increased cash costs were driven by increased stripping, lower grades and lower tons milled, partially offset by increased recoveries. * Martha in New Zealand sold 30,100 ounces (+9%) at total cash costs of $206 per ounce (-13%) in the second quarter. Increased sales reflected increased ore grades (+41%), partially offset by lower recoveries. Lower cash costs reflected increased silver by-product credits, lower maintenance costs and higher production. * Minahasa in Indonesia sold 23,600 equity ounces (-11%) at total cash costs of $302 per ounce (+13%) in the second quarter. While mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, the processing of stockpiled ore is expected to continue through the third quarter of 2004. 1.

Reflects co-product accounting for 2003 and 2004. Other Highlights Cash and Debt At the end of the second quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.47 billion and outstanding debt totaled $1.76 billion. Of the outstanding debt, $805.2 million is Batu Hijau debt that is non-recourse to Newmont. During the second quarter, the Company eliminated $124.1 million in infrastructure bonds assumed as part of the Normandy acquisition in 2002. Newmont Capital Newmont Capital manages the Company's royalty, dividend and equity portfolios. For the second quarter, royalty and dividend income was $15.4 million, compared to $10.5 million for the year ago quarter. The increase was mostly due to higher oil and gas prices. For the first six months, royalty and dividend income was $28.5 million, compared with $24.9 million for the first half of 2003. During the second quarter, Newmont Capital entered into several transactions, including the purchase of marketable equity securities for approximately $94 million. Asset rationalization and portfolio optimization efforts continue, with agreements entered into for: -- the possible sale, subject to various financing, governmental, legal and regulatory approvals, of the Ovacik mine in Western Turkey; -- the sale, subject to various approvals, of the recently closed Bronzewing mine in Western Australia; and -- the purchase of the Holt McDermott mill and mill-related facilities in Ontario, Canada from Barrick. Project Development & Exploration The Leeville underground project in Nevada is on schedule for initial gold production in late 2005. The production and ventilation shafts were 1,095 feet (59% complete) and 1,365 feet (94% complete), respectively, from surface at the end of the second quarter. The drift from the Carlin East underground mine to the Leeville ventilation shaft was approximately 97% complete at the end of the second quarter. The capital cost estimate has increased from approximately $190 million to approximately $205 million, attributable in part to increased dewatering requirements which resulted in the installation of two additional dewatering wells and pumps. At Phoenix in Nevada, engineering is 12% complete and civil construction is expected to commence in early 2005. The project remains on schedule for initial gold production in 2006. At Ahafo in Ghana, the EPCM contract has been awarded and long lead-time equipment is being ordered. The initial construction contract for site access and camp infrastructure was awarded and construction has commenced. Meetings with stakeholders on crop and land compensation are progressing well. The project remains on schedule for initial gold production in 2006. At Akyem in Ghana, an updated feasibility study is in progress. Completion of permitting and license requirements is expected by year-end and a development decision is expected in late 2004 or early 2005. At Minas Conga in Peru, this year's drilling program is essentially complete. The feasibility study is ongoing and several trade-off studies are in progress. The estimated project cost for 2004 is $18 million, all of which is being expensed. At Boddington in Australia, the feasibility study update is being actively progressed by the three joint venture partners, with the aim of completing the update by mid-2005. Current activities include finalizing additional metallurgical testwork, refining the geologic model and preparing updated cost and schedule estimates. During the second quarter, Newmont completed approximately 775,000 feet of exploration drilling. Exploration, research and development expenditures of $48.2 million in the second quarter were 57% higher than the year ago quarter. The guidance for exploration, research and development expenditures for 2004 has been increased to between $180 million and $200 million on a consolidated basis, reflecting expanded feasibility study work at Minas Conga in Peru, Akyem in Ghana and at Martabe in Indonesia, as well as increased drilling at Phoenix in Nevada and Yanacocha in Peru. Exploration activities in the first half of 2004 have produced promising results and the Company is optimistic that it will be able to grow reserves from exploration in 2004. Reserve additions are possible from Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana, Martabe in Indonesia, and Phoenix and Gold Quarry in Nevada. Positive drilling results from beneath the Akyem deposit indicate the potential to deepen the current reserve pit. At Ahafo, drilling to test extensions of the Kenyase East, Kenyase Central and Area E deposits has identified significant, continuous zones of gold mineralization at all three deposits that extend beyond the reported 2003 year-end reserve pits. At Martabe in Indonesia, this year's drilling program is focused on advancing the Purnama and Baskara deposits into reserves. Completion of the resource model and feasibility study is expected by the end of the year. In Nevada, drilling has expanded the mineralization at Dos Equis, an extension of the Gold Quarry open-pit deposit. Drilling continues to intercept significant zones of oxide leach mineralization, which will augment future pit expansions. Drilling at Phoenix has provided encouraging results from the Minnie pit, with an expanded drilling program in the main Phoenix deposit at the Fortitude pit and Box Canyon area currently underway. 2004 Guidance The Company reaffirmed 2004 equity gold sales guidance of between 7.0 million and 7.2 million ounces and total cash costs of between $225 and $235 per ounce. Equity gold sales for the second half of 2004 are weighted towards the fourth quarter, particularly in Nevada and at Yanacocha in Peru.

Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound (dollars in millions except per ounce amounts) The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.
