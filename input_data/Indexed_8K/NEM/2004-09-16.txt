Exhibit 99.1 Minera Yanacocha's Peruvian Operations Scaled Back DENVER and LIMA, Peru, Sept. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and Compania de Minas Buenaventura (NYSE: BVN) today announced that Minera Yanacocha has begun to scale back mining operations at its mine north of the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The decision was made after careful consideration of safety and operational concerns resulting from a blockade of the access road to the mine. Gold production will not be affected in the near term. Minera Yanacocha believes that the only responsible and prudent decision is for it to begin scaling back its operations, so that the operators can increase its focus on safety and environmental protection. A blockade of the road leading to the mine and sporadic acts of violence have created a situation that has led to increased concerns, which have been heightened by a general strike that has been called in the entire Cajamarca province today. Carlos Santa Cruz, Vice President of South American Operations of Newmont, said, "We will not compromise safety standards, nor risk any harm to the environment." Since September 2, a group of local people have blocked the road to the mine in protest of exploration drilling conducted, in accordance with the relevant permit, on the Cerro Quilish gold deposit. On September 7, Minera Yanacocha agreed to suspend exploratory drilling in an effort to calm the situation and restore order. Roque Benavides, President and Chief Executive Officer of Buenaventura, said, "We have been working and will continue to work for a peaceful resolution based on the rule of law, the right to work, and stability in the city of Cajamarca." Minera Yanacocha will resume normal operations when it can do so safely.
