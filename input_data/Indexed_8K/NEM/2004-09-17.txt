Exhibit 99.1 Minera Yanacocha Resumes Mining Operations in Peru DENVER and LIMA, Peru, Sept. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and Compania de Minas Buenaventura (NYSE: BVN) today announced that Minera Yanacocha has begun resuming normal mining operations at its mine north of the city of Cajamarca, Peru, after an agreement was reached between the Government of Peru, representatives from the Cajamarca community and Minera Yanacocha. The blockade of the access road to the mine ended at approximately 4:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time today. Minera Yanacocha had scaled back mining operations earlier in the week as a result of a blockade of the mine access road. The temporary scaling back of mining operations will not impact the estimated full year 2004 gold production and sales of approximately three million ounces, on a 100% basis, from Yanacocha. Minera Yanacocha worked with all parties to reach consensus to set aside the exploration drilling permit at the Cerro Quilish gold deposit so that further hydrological studies can be conducted to assess any future impact Cerro Quilish may have on the Cajamarca community's water supply. Carlos Santa Cruz, Vice President of South American Operations of Newmont, said, "We are pleased that negotiations led to a peaceful resolution of this matter. We understand the importance of safeguarding the water supply in the Cajamarca region." Roque Benavides, President and Chief Executive Officer of Buenaventura, said, "Mining is a vital part of Peru, creating economic opportunities, jobs and enhancement of the quality of life for local communities. We look forward to working with the local community in a mutually beneficial and fair manner." Newmont, Buenaventura and the Internacional Finance Corporation hold 51.35%, 43.65% and 5%, respectively, in Minera Yanacocha.
