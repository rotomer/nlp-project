Exhibit 99.1 Newmont Announces Third Quarter Net Income of $128.7 million ($0.29 per share); Nine Month Net Income of $252.9 million ($0.57 per share) DENVER, Oct. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced third quarter net income applicable to common shares of $128.7 million ($0.29 per share) compared with net income of $114.4 million ($0.28 per share) for the third quarter of 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter increased 32% to $339.3 million from $256.7 million for the third quarter of 2003. Newmont sold 1.73 million equity ounces of gold at total cash costs of $233 per ounce during the quarter. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our higher third quarter cash flow and earnings reflected the strength and flexibility of our asset portfolio. We continue to expect equity gold sales of approximately seven million ounces for 2004. We also remain optimistic for reserve growth in 2004 through our ongoing exploration success in Ghana and elsewhere."

For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce and total production costs per ounce (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Financial & Operating Review Third quarter net income applicable to common shares was $128.7 million ($0.29 per share), compared with $114.4 million ($0.28 per share) for the third quarter of 2003. For the first nine months, net income applicable to common shares was $252.9 million ($0.57 per share), compared with net income of $322.5 million ($0.80 per share) for the first nine months of 2003. Net income for the third quarter of 2004 was impacted by the following items: - an $8.2 million ($0.02 per share) non-cash write-down of assets in Australia and at Yanacocha; - a $6.0 million ($0.01 per share) charge for increased Australian legacy site reclamation accruals; - a $7.3 million ($0.02 per share) gain on the sale of the Bronzewing mine in Australia; and - other miscellaneous charges of $3.9 million ($0.01 per share). These transactions had the effect of reducing net income for the third quarter of 2004 by $10.8 million ($0.02 per share). Net income for the third quarter of 2003 was impacted by the following items: - a net $13.6 million ($0.03 per share) loss on investments, primarily related to the sale of 28 million shares of Kinross Gold; - a $32.8 million ($0.08 per share) loss for the change in fair value of gold derivative instruments that did not qualify as "effective hedges" and were thus recognized in income; - a $14.5 million ($0.04 per share) gain on the extinguishment of Yandal bonds; - a $20.9 million ($0.05 per share) gain on the extinguishment of Yandal derivative liabilities; and - other miscellaneous charges totaling $3.0 million ($0.01 per share). These transactions had the effect of reducing net income for the third quarter of 2003 by $14.0 million ($0.03 per share). For the third quarter of 2004, the Company sold 1,734,700 equity ounces of gold, 16% lower than the third quarter of 2003. During the first nine months of 2004, the Company sold 5,190,400 equity ounces of gold, compared with 5,668,500 equity ounces sold in the first nine months of 2003. The decreases in both periods primarily represented lower sales in Nevada due to increased stripping and lower grades as well as operations that have been sold. The average realized gold price in the quarter was $404 per equity ounce, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter. For the first nine months, the average realized gold price was $404 per equity ounce, a 13% increase over the prior year period. The Company generated net cash from operating activities of $339.3 million in the third quarter and $972.3 million for the first nine months of 2004. In the third quarter of 2004, Newmont reclassified dividends paid to minority interests from the operating activities section to the financing activities section of the cash flow statement for 2003 and 2004. Previously, dividends paid to minority interests were netted against "minority interest" in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2003 was negatively impacted by the early settlement of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges. Operating Highlights - Third Quarter North America Q3 Q3 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 625.8 786.2 1,966.0 2,170.7 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $292 $239 $283 $238 * Nevada operations sold 570,400 equity ounces in the third quarter (-18%) with 10% lower mill ore grade and 16% lower leach production. Higher total cash costs of $287 per ounce (+20%) were primarily attributable to lower grade ore resulting from continued stripping at Gold Quarry and Twin Creeks as well as higher diesel, electricity and equipment maintenance costs. Major stripping campaigns at Gold Quarry and Twin Creeks are expected to augment production and decrease total cash costs beginning in 2005. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 26,200 ounces in the third quarter (-39%) at total cash costs of $418 per ounce (+76%). Lower sales and higher costs were primarily due to a temporary production suspension caused by an ore hoisting system failure in late June 2004, from decreasing access, lower mill ore grades (-24%), and from appreciation of the Canadian dollar. * Holloway in Canada sold 13,300 equity ounces in the third quarter (-24%) at total cash costs of $376 per ounce (+27%). Lower sales resulted from a 7% decrease in mill throughput and a build in inventory that was partially offset by 5% higher mill ore grades. Higher unit costs were attributable to lower production and increased costs for manpower, steel and electricity and from appreciation of the Canadian dollar. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 15,900 equity ounces in the third quarter (-4%) at total cash costs of $179 per ounce (-1%). Lower leach tons placed (-5%) offset higher ore grades mined (+6%). South America Q3 Q3 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 401.0 495.0 1,141.8 1,274.5 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $140 $121 $141 $125 * Yanacocha in Peru sold 397,000 equity ounces in the third quarter (-12%) at total cash costs of $139 per ounce (+23%). Lower gold sales resulted from a 9% decrease in leach tons placed and a slower recovery rate at La Quinua. Increased costs for diesel, reagent and waste stripping, as well as higher fuel consumption from longer haul distances impacted costs. The temporary scaling back of mining operations due to a blockade of the mine's access road during the quarter did not change the full year 2004 equity gold sales forecast of 1.54 million equity ounces at total cash costs of approximately $135 per ounce. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 4,000 equity ounces (-91%) at total cash costs of $235 per ounce (+18%). Open-pit mining activities were completed in October 2003 with production continuing from residual leaching. Australia/New Zealand Q3 Q3 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 472.6 541.6 1,429.8 1,534.1 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $269 $234 $269 $236 * The Australian and New Zealand operations sold 472,600 equity ounces (-13%) in the third quarter, with lower gold sales largely attributable to the sale of two Yandal mines. Total cash costs of $269 per equity ounce were up 15% from the year ago quarter, largely due to stronger Australian and New Zealand dollar exchange rates and higher fuel and consumable costs. Over the past 12 months, the Australian and New Zealand dollars have risen approximately 7% and 14% respectively against the US dollar. In the third quarter: * Kalgoorlie sold 124,800 equity ounces (+8%) at total cash costs of $278 per ounce (+5%). Increased gold sales were the result of 15% higher ore grades. * Pajingo sold 58,300 ounces (-36%) at total cash costs of $226 per ounce (+77%). Lower gold sales were primarily due to lower mill ore grade (-36%). Higher cash costs reflected lower production due to lower ore grades. * Tanami sold 163,800 ounces (+7%) at total cash costs of $273 per ounce (+13%). Higher sales resulted from higher ore grades (+18%) at Groundrush, partially offset by lower mill throughput (-5%). Higher cash costs were impacted by increased underground backfill costs. * Yandal sold 77,900 ounces (-49%) at total cash costs of $308 per ounce (+14%). Lower sales largely reflected the sale of the Wiluna and Bronzewing mines. At Jundee, higher cash costs reflected increased open-pit mining costs. * Martha in New Zealand sold 37,600 ounces (+44%) at total cash costs of $206 per ounce (-5%). Higher gold sales reflected increased ore grades (+54%), partially offset by a lower recovery rate (-5%). Lower cash costs resulted from higher production. * Golden Grove sold 7.4 million pounds of copper (-15%) and 27.3 million pounds of zinc (+188%). Total cash costs were $0.89 and $0.40 per pound, respectively, compared to the year ago quarter of $0.47 and $0.05 per pound, respectively. Higher cash costs reflected lower by-product credits and increased ground support costs. Indonesia Q3 Q3 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity copper sales (M lbs) 111.3 103.2 292.0 264.3 Total cash costs ($/lb Cu)(1),(2) $0.56 $0.34 $0.55 $0.38 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 154.5 139.6 371.9 343.9 Total cash costs ($/oz Au) (1),(2) $163 $159 $188 $182 * Effective January 1, 2004, the Company began consolidating Batu Hijau and changed to co-product cost accounting for copper and gold, whereby production costs are allocated in proportion to the sales revenue generated by each product. As a result, reported cash costs are impacted by relative movements in the copper and gold prices. * Batu Hijau sold 111.3 million equity pounds of copper in the third quarter (+8%) at total cash costs of $0.56 per pound. Higher copper sales reflected increased throughput (+7%) from crusher modifications completed in late 2003. Improved copper ore grades (+7%) were offset by an inventory increase due to shipment timing. Costs were impacted by higher treatment and refining charges and higher mining and processing costs associated with harder ores. The realized copper price for the third quarter was $1.42 per pound, a 69% increase from the 2003 third quarter. * Batu Hijau sold 134,100 equity ounces of gold (+15%) at total cash costs of $166 per ounce in the third quarter. Increased gold sales reflected increased throughput (+7%) and higher gold ore grades (+12%), offset by an increase in inventory. * Newmont's economic interest in Batu Hijau for the third quarter was 56.25%. Effective October 1, 2004, Newmont's economic interest decreased to 52.875%, reflecting cumulative positive retained earnings at the end of the third quarter resulting in the initiation of dividend payments to the minority partner. * Minahasa in Indonesia sold 20,400 equity ounces (-12%) at total cash costs of $146 per ounce (-20%) in the third quarter. Although mining ceased at Minahasa in October 2001, stockpiled ore was processed until the mine closed in August 2004. * Following recent accusations related to alleged pollution in Buyat Bay near the Minahasa mine, five Minahasa employees were detained for questioning by Indonesian police during the quarter. Independent tests conducted by the World Health Organization, the Indonesian Government and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization have all demonstrated that Minahasa has not caused environmental pollution. The five Minahasa employees were recently released from the police detention facility in Jakarta. Newmont remains steadfast that Minahasa did not cause environmental pollution and will continue to defend Minahasa, its employees and the Company's reputation against all accusations. Central Asia/Europe Q3 Q3 YTD YTD 2004 2003 2004 2003 Equity gold sales (000 ozs) 80.8 101.7 280.9 309.6 Total cash costs ($/ounce)(1) $169 $141 $168 $138 * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 46,100 equity ounces (-8%) at total cash costs of $165 per ounce (+8%) in the third quarter. Lower gold sales were primarily attributable to lower leach grade (-9%) due to the transition to a lower grade ore zone and decreased crusher throughput (-5%) from a conveyor change over. * Ovacik in Turkey sold 34,700 ounces (-33%) at total cash costs of $174 per ounce (+36%) in the third quarter. In July 2004, a Turkish court ordered the suspension of operating permits pending the completion of certain additional permitting requirements, including the submission of an updated environmental impact assessment. The operation is complying with the court's order and is working with the Turkish authorities to obtain permission to reopen the mine. Lower sales reflected the suspension, partially offset by a reduction in inventories. Increased cash costs were the result of lower production. 1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce and per pound and total production costs per ounce and per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. 2. 2003 total cash costs for Indonesia included pro forma results for Batu Hijau to reflect the change to co-product accounting effective January 1, 2004. Other Highlights Cash, Marketable Securities and Debt At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 billion and outstanding debt totaled $1.7 billion. Of the outstanding debt, $784.1 million was Batu Hijau debt that is non-recourse to Newmont. During the third quarter, outstanding debt decreased by $66 million. At the close of markets on September 30, the value of the Company's marketable securities and other short-term investments portfolio was $413.4 million. Newmont Capital Newmont Capital manages the Company's royalty and marketable securities portfolios as well as asset transactions. For the third quarter, royalty and dividend income was $19.1 million compared to $15.8 million for the year ago quarter. For the nine months, royalty and dividend income was $47.6 million compared with $40.8 million for the same period in 2003. The increases primarily reflected higher oil and gas prices and distributions from the Canadian Oil Sands Trust investment made in 2004. During the third quarter, Newmont Capital entered into or closed the following transactions and agreements, reflecting new strategic investments and ongoing portfolio optimization efforts: - the purchase of additional units of the Canadian Oil Sands Trust, increasing Newmont's position to 6 million units (or approximately 6.8% of units outstanding) and raising the total cost basis of the investment to approximately $200 million; - the acquisition of a 10.2% equity interest in Gabriel Resources Ltd, which is advancing the Rosia Montana gold project in Romania; - the sale of the Bronzewing mine in Western Australia; - an agreement to facilitate the restructuring of Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC) and eliminate all remaining associated Newmont guarantees and obligations in exchange for an injection of subordinated debt, pending approval by AMC shareholders in the fourth quarter in 2004; and - an agreement to sell Newmont's joint venture minority interest in the Midwest uranium deposit in Saskatchewan to Denison Mines Ltd. Project Development & Exploration The Leeville project in Nevada remains on schedule for initial gold production in late 2005. The production and ventilation shafts were 1,441 feet (79% complete) and 1,380 feet (94% complete), respectively, from the surface at the end of the third quarter. The drift from the Carlin East underground mine to the Leeville ventilation shaft was completed during the quarter. At Phoenix in Nevada, engineering is approximately 51% complete with construction scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter. This project remains on schedule for initial gold production in mid-2006. At Gold Quarry/Dos Equis, ongoing stripping has started to uncover higher grade refractory ores. Year-end 2003 reserves were 6 million ounces after 2003 additions extended the mine life from 6 to 11 years. Exploration results this year have identified mineralization extensions containing additional refractory and oxide ores. At the Ahafo project in Ghana, engineering work is progressing with long-lead-time equipment ordered. Camp and infrastructure construction have commenced, along with earth work preparation for the mill and the water storage dam. The Afaho project remains on schedule for initial gold production in the second half of 2006. At Akyem in Ghana, the feasibility study update is progressing on schedule. A development decision is expected in the first quarter of 2005. At Boddington in Australia, completion of the feasibility study update is expected by mid-2005. The community engagement planning process and a detailed social impact assessment commenced in October with metallurgical test work and geological modeling continuing. Kori Chaca, a new oxide satellite deposit at the Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia, is scheduled for development in 2005 with leaching expected to begin in the second half of 2005. Pre-production capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $20 million. Kori Kollo is expected to produce approximately 250,000 to 300,000 equity ounces in total from 2005 to 2008. Exploration activities during the third quarter continued, with ongoing success in Ghana and a focus on replacing and growing reserves net of depletion for 2004. Third quarter exploration, research and development expenditures were $54.1 million, compared with $30.6 million in the year ago quarter. Guidance for exploration, research and development expenditures for 2004 remains between $180 million and $200 million on a consolidated basis, reflecting expanded feasibility study work at Minas Conga in Peru, Akyem in Ghana and Martabe in Indonesia. Reserve additions at Phoenix in Nevada are expected for 2004 from the ongoing 150-hole infill and extension drilling program. 2004 Guidance For 2004, the Company expects gold sales of approximately 7 million equity ounces at total cash costs of approximately $230 to $235 per ounce.

Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound (dollars in millions except per ounce amounts) The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be
