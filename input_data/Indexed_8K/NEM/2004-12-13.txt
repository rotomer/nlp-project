Item 1.01Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 7, 2004, the consulting agreement (the "Consulting Agreement") by and between Newmont Capital Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Newmont" or the "Company"), and Seymour Schulich, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, was amended. The Amendment, which will be effective as of April 1, 2005, (1) amends a recital so as to reflect the increase to $40,000 of the annual retainer that Mr. Schulich receives as a director of Newmont, (2) extends the term of the Consulting Agreement, which was set to expire on March 31, 2005, until March 31, 2008 and (3) provides for the payment of a termination fee in the amount of $750,000 to Mr. Schulich upon the expiration of the Consulting Agreement or termination of the Consulting Agreement by either party for any reason, subject to certain limited exceptions. A copy of the Amendment is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. A copy of the Consulting Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10(x) to Newmont's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
On December 7, 2004, the Committee granted to certain executive officers non-qualified stock options (the "Options") to purchase shares of Newmont's common stock, $1.60 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Newmont Mining Corporation 1996 Employees Stock Plan (the "Plan"). The terms of the Options are governed by the Plan and subject to the restrictions set forth in a standard form award agreement (the "Grant Agreement") which is delivered to each grantee. A copy of the form of Grant Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report. The Company plans to use the form of Grant Agreement for future grants of non-qualified stock options to executive officers, including the Company's named executive officers.
 
As detailed more fully in the form of Grant Agreement, grantees receive non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Newmont's Common Stock at a price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. No portion of an option is exercisable before the first anniversary of the grant date. On the first anniversary of the grant date, the option becomes exercisable as to one-third of the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by the option and on each subsequent anniversary, so that the option becomes fully exercisable commencing on the third anniversary of the grant date. Each option expires ten years after the grant date or such earlier date as (i) all shares of Common Stock covered by the option shall have been purchased, or (ii) the option shall have expired because of the termination of the grantee's employment with the Company as described in the form of Grant Agreement. If the grantee's employment with the Company terminates, the expiration date of the option and the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the option shall be determined using the applicable criteria and formula contained in the form of Grant Agreement. The exercise price of an option may be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, subject to certain limitations, as described in the form of Grant Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Termination Payment shall not be payable if Newmont terminates this Agreement as a result of (1) the willful and continued failure of the Contractor to perform the Services (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Contractor which identifies the manner in which Newmont believes that Contractor

Regardless of Newmont's actions in this regard, Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any and all
Withholding Taxes.
 
Tax-Related Items is and remains the responsibility and liability of Grantee and that Newmont and the Subsidiaries: (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the grant or exercise of this Option and the subsequent sale of Stock acquired under the Plan; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of this Option to reduce or eliminate Grantee's liability for Tax-Related Items.

In this regard, Grantee authorizes Newmont and the Subsidiaries to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Grantee from Grantee's salary or other cash compensation paid to Grantee by Newmont or a Subsidiary. Alternatively, or in addition, if permitted by the Committee and under applicable laws, regulations and rules, Newmont may allow Grantee to elect to satisfy such withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items by: (1) having Newmont withhold and sell or arrange for the sale of shares of Stock, on behalf of Grantee, that Grantee acquires upon exercise of this Option to meet such withholding obligations; , , the Fair Market Value of such shares of Stock cannot exceed the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state income and payroll taxes that are applicable to the payment of supplemental wages; or (2) by tendering to Newmont or a Subsidiary shares of Stock already owned by Grantee (or by Grantee and Grantee's spouse jointly) for at least six months (or any shorter period necessary to avoid a charge to Newmont's or a Subsidiary's earnings for financial reporting purposes) prior to such tender, which may include shares received as the result of a prior exercise of this Option, in full or partial satisfaction of such tax obligations, based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. Grantee shall also pay to Newmont or a Subsidiary in cash any amount of any Tax-Related Items that Newmont or the Subsidiaries may be required to withhold as a result of Grantee's participation in the Plan or Grantee's purchase of Stock that are not satisfied by the means described in the immediately preceding sentence. Grantee acknowledges that Newmont has advised Grantee to consult a tax adviser with respect to tax consequences for Grantee upon the disposition of Stock under the Plan.

(g) Neither Grantee nor any other person shall become the beneficial owner of any shares of Stock, nor have any rights to dividends or other rights as a shareholder with respect to any such shares, until Grantee has exercised this Option in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Plan.
No Rights as a Stockholder

(h) . This Option and the obligation of Newmont to sell and deliver shares of Stock hereunder shall be subject to (i) all applicable Federal and state laws, rules and regulations and (ii) any registration, qualification, approvals or other requirements imposed by any government or regulatory agency or body which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or applicable. Moreover, this Option may not be exercised if its exercise, or the receipt of shares of Stock pursuant thereto, would be contrary to applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange.

Acknowledgements.

Grantee understands that his or her employer, Newmont and the Subsidiaries hold certain personal information about Grantee, including but not limited to his or her name, home address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number, salary, nationality, job title and details of all options or other entitlement to shares of common stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding ("personal data"). Certain personal data may also constitute "sensitive personal data" within the meaning of applicable law. Such data include but are not limited to the information provided above and any changes thereto and other appropriate personal and financial data about Grantee. Grantee hereby gives explicit consent to Newmont and any of the Subsidiaries to process any such personal data and/or sensitive personal data. Grantee also hereby gives explicit consent to Newmont to transfer any such personal data and/or sensitive personal data outside the country in which Grantee is employed, including, but not limited to the United States. The legal persons for whom such personal data are intended include, but are not limited to Newmont and its agent, Mellon Investor Services. Grantee has been informed of his/her right of access and correction to his/her personal data by applying to Director of Compensation, Newmont Corporate.
 
3. Grantee understands that Newmont has reserved the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, and that the grant of an option under the Plan at one time does not in any way obligate Newmont or the Subsidiaries to grant additional options in any future year or in any given amount. Grantee acknowledges and understands that this Option is granted in connection with Grantee's status as an employee of his or her employer and can in no event be interpreted or understood to mean that Newmont Mining Corporation is Grantee's employer or that there is an employment relationship between Grantee and Newmont Mining Corporation.

4. Grantee acknowledges and understands that the future value of the shares purchased by Grantee under the Plan is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and that no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from the termination of this Option or the Plan or the diminution in value of this Option or any shares purchased under the Plan and Grantee irrevocably releases Newmont and the Subsidiaries from any such claim that may arise.
 
C.

retained in the service of any Subsidiary for any period at all, nor restrict in any way the right of any such Subsidiary, which right is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate his employment at any time with or without cause. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that any right to exercise this Option is earned only by continuing as an employee of a Subsidiary at the will of such Subsidiary, or satisfaction of any other applicable terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the Plan, and not through the act of being hired, being granted this Option or acquiring shares of Stock hereunder.
 
3. If at the time of exercise of all or part of this Option, the Stock is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and/or there is no current prospectus in effect under the Securities Act with respect to the Stock, Grantee shall execute, prior to the delivery of any shares of Stock to Grantee by Newmont, an agreement (in such form as the Committee may specify) in which Grantee represents and warrants that Grantee is purchasing or acquiring the shares acquired under this Agreement for Grantee's own account, for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof, and represents and agrees that any subsequent offer for sale or distribution of any kind of such shares shall be made only pursuant to either (i) a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act, which registration statement has become effective and is current with regard to the shares being offered or sold, or (ii) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption Grantee shall, prior to any offer for sale of such shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee, from counsel for or approved by the Committee, as to the applicability of such exemption thereto.

7. Except as otherwise permitted by the Plan, this Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any provision hereof be waived, in any way except in writing signed by the parties hereto.

Modification.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, pursuant to Grantee's Grant Acknowledgment (including, without limitation, the Terms and Conditions section thereof), incorporated herein by reference, and electronically executed by Grantee, Grantee agrees to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement.
 
 
 
 
This Addendum is incorporated into the Award Agreement (Agreement) dated [                                   ], granted under the Newmont Mining Corporation 1996 Employees Stock Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of this Addendum is to address country-specific regulatory requirements imposed by certain countries. Several countries have foreign currency exchange controls, which make it difficult for Grantee to exercise options with cash. With respect to these countries, the provisions in this Addendum substitute the corresponding provisions of the Agreement in their entirety, and provide that the exercise of an option must be performed through a "cashless exercise," where the exercise price is settled through the same-day-sale of shares. Under this method of exercise, there should be no violation of exchange controls because there are no monies being remitted outside the country. Other country specific regulatory issues that may be addressed in this Addendum include prohibitions against ownership of foreign investment, severance benefits, and labor laws.
 
This Addendum may be supplemented from time to time to address country-specific regulatory requirements where Newmont does not currently grant Options, and to provide the necessary modifications to qualify for preferential tax treatment when available. Any modification of this Addendum that materially impairs the rights and obligations conferred under the Plan and Agreement shall require the consent of Grantee.
 
The provisions set forth below shall substitute any corresponding provisions of the Agreement in their entirety, as indicated herein. The application of this Addendum is specified below. For certain countries, the provisions in this Addendum shall be applied based on Grantee's country of citizenship (e.g., Australia and Canada) regardless of where they are resident, while other provisions apply based on the residence of Grantee on certain specified dates (e.g., Indonesia and Uzbekistan).

The thirty-six month period shall be deemed to begin on the date of termination of Grantee's employment described in subparagraph A.2(d)(v).

If, during the four-month period following such termination of employment, Newmont, in its sole discretion, determines that Grantee is permanently disabled in accordance with the terms of any law, national disability program, agreement or any plan maintained by Newmont or any Subsidiary, which Newmont determines to be applicable, the provisions of paragraph A.2(d)(ii) shall apply.
