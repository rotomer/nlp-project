Exhibit 99.1 NEWMONT REPORTS RECORD EQUITY GOLD RESERVES OF 92.4 MILLION OUNCES AT YEAR-END 2004 DENVER, Feb. 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) reported record proven and probable gold reserves of 92.4 million equity ounces for year-end 2004, based on a gold price assumption of $350 per ounce. Commenting on the exploration results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wayne W. Murdy said, "In 2004, we again exceeded our goal of replacing depletion through exploration and had another year of reserve growth, adding 8.6 million equity ounces." Describing the exploration results, President Pierre Lassonde said, "Our reserve growth highlights the strength of our exploration team, our extensive land position and our proprietary technologies. We had another outstanding year in Ghana, adding 4.1 million equity ounces and increasing equity reserves by 35% to 16.0 million ounces. Nevada also more than replaced depletion, adding 3.2 million ounces and increasing reserves to a record 33.7 million equity ounces." The Company also updated its equity gold reserve price sensitivity. As illustrated below, if calculated at gold prices of $375 and $400 per ounce, gold reserves would increase to approximately 98 million ounces and 101 million ounces, respectively. The full impact of higher gold prices on our equity gold reserves is constrained by limited drill data on the margins of known mineralization. 2004 Exploration Highlights * In Ghana, reserves increased by 4.1 million equity ounces to 16.0 million equity ounces. * In Nevada, reserves net of depletion grew to a 39-year record of 34.0 million equity ounces, with 2.3 million ounces added at Phoenix. * In Peru, 4.5 million equity ounces were added at Minas Conga. * In Indonesia, Batu Hijau replaced equity gold reserves net of depletion.

(1) Reserves are calculated at US$350, A$550, or NZ$650 per ounce gold price unless otherwise noted. 2003 reserves were calculated at a US$325, A$545, or NZ$665 per ounce gold price unless otherwise noted. Tonnage amounts have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 and gold ounces have been rounded to the nearest 10,000. (2) Includes undeveloped reserves at Castle Reef, North Lantern and Emigrant deposits for combined total undeveloped reserves of 1,450,000 ounces. (3) Deposit is currently undeveloped except for minor leach production. Construction of facilities began in November 2004. (4) Includes partially developed reserves at Leeville, which contains total reserves of 2,610,000 ounces. (5) Also contains reserves of over 18 million ounces of silver with a metallurgical recovery of 91%. (6) Reserve estimates provided by Placer Dome, the operator of the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture. (7) Stockpiles are primarily material that has been set aside to allow processing of higher grade material in the mills. Stockpiles increase or decrease depending on current mine plans. Stockpiles are reported separately where tonnage or contained ounces are greater than 5 percent of the total site reported reserves and contained ounces are greater than 100,000 ounces. (8) Material in-process represents that material on leach pads at the end of the year from which gold remains to be recovered. Material in-process is reported separately where tonnage or contained ounces are greater than 5 percent of the total site reported reserves and contained ounces are greater than 100,000 ounces. (9) Percentage reflects Newmont's weighted equity interest from 84.65% interest in Holloway JV and 100% interest in remaining reserves. In 2003 this percentage was 91.5%. Property includes currently undeveloped reserves at the Blacktop deposit of 80,000 ounces. (10) Reported reserves are based on Newmont's 51.35% equity interest. Yanacocha is consolidated on a 100% basis for accounting purposes, then the minority interests of our partners are recognized. Reserves include currently undeveloped deposits at Corimayo and Chaquicocha Sur, which contain combined undeveloped reserves of 2,970,000 equity ounces. (11) Deposit is undeveloped. (12) Reserves at Kori Chaca containing 300,000 equity ounces are currently being developed. (13) As in 2003, reserves were calculated at a A$425 per ounce gold price, and accounted for on an equity basis. Deposit is currently undeveloped. (14) Gold reported in reserves is contained within zinc and copper ore bodies. (15) Reserve based on A$560 per ounce gold price. Percentage reflects Newmont's equity interest. Pro-rata consolidated for accounting purposes. (16) Property was sold in 2004 after reserves were depleted. (17) Includes currently undeveloped reserves at the Favona deposit containing 350,000 ounces. (18) Percentage reflects Newmont's economic interest in remaining reserves. (19) Processing of remaining stockpiles was completed in August 2004. (20) Mine has been shut down since September 2004, pending re-issuance of operating permits from the Turkish government. (21) Property sold in December 2004. (22) Reserves are primarily designated stockpile material.

Tonnage amounts have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 and copper pounds have been rounded to the nearest 10,000,000. (2) Deposit is currently undeveloped except for minor gold leach production. Construction of facilities began in November 2004. (3) Deposit is undeveloped. (4) Stockpiles are primarily material that has been set aside to allow processing of higher grade material in the mills. Stockpiles increase or decrease depending on current mine plans. Stockpiles are reported separately where tonnage or contained metal are greater than 5 percent of the total site reported reserves. (5) Percentage reflects Newmont's economic interest in remaining reserves. (6) As in 2003, reserves are calculated at a A$425 per ounce gold price and a A$1.25 per pound copper price, and accounted for on an equity basis. Deposit is undeveloped. (7) Reserves are calculated at a A$0.62 per pound zinc price. 2003 reserves were calculated at a A$0.71 per pound zinc price. Tonnage amounts have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 and zinc pounds have been rounded to the nearest 10,000,000.

Table 3: Equity Gold Mineralized Material not in Reserves - U.S. Units December 31, 2004 (1)
(1) Mineralized material calculated at a gold price of US$375, A$600, or NZ$715 per ounce unless otherwise noted. 2003 mineralized material was calculated at a US$350, A$600, or NZ$715 per ounce gold price. Tonnage amounts have been rounded to the nearest 100,000. (2) Mineralized material estimates were provided by Placer Dome, the operator of the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture. Placer Dome calculated mineralized material not in reserves using a $425 per ounce gold price assumption. (3) Stockpiles are primarily material that has been set aside to allow processing of higher grade material in the mills. Stockpiles increase or decrease depending on current mine plans. (4) Percentage reflects Newmont's weighted interest in mineralized material. In 2003, this percentage was 99.3%. (5) Mineralized material estimates were provided by Penoles, the operator of the Mezcala project. Penoles calculated mineralized material at a $400 per ounce gold price. (6) Mineralized material estimates were provided by Buenaventura, the operator of the La Zanja Project. Buenaventura calculated mineralized material at a $350 per ounce gold price. (7) Mineralized material calculated at a A$650 per ounce gold price. (8) Percentage reflects Newmont's economic interest.
