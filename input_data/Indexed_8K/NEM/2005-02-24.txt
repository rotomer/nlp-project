Exhibit 99.1 NEWMONT ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME OF $182 MILLION ($0.41 PER SHARE); 2004 NET INCOME OF $435 MILLION ($0.98 PER SHARE) DENVER, Feb. 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced fourth quarter net income of $181.6 million ($0.41 per share) compared with net income of $153.1 million ($0.36 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2003. Newmont earned net income of $434.5 million ($0.98 per share) for 2004. Fourth quarter and 2004 highlights included: * Equity gold sales(1) for the fourth quarter of 1.8 million ounces at total cash costs(2) of $226 per ounce; equity gold sales for 2004 of 7.0 million ounces at total cash costs of $231 per ounce; * Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of $587 million and 2004 net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion; and * Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments exceeded debt by $490 million at year-end. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We ended the year with a strong fourth quarter, benefiting from rising gold prices. Our record $1.6 billion cash flow from operations in 2004 demonstrated the strength of our portfolio and our leverage to the gold price. We remain optimistic about gold prices given the current macro-economic and market fundamentals."
1. Equity gold sales are those attributable to Newmont's ownership or economic interest. 2. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce and total production costs per ounce (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. Financial & Operating Review Fourth quarter net income was $181.6 million ($0.41 per share), compared with $153.1 million ($0.36 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2003. For 2004, net income was $434.5 million ($0.98 per share), compared with net income of $475.7 million ($1.16 per share) for 2003. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was impacted by the following items: * a $9 million ($0.02 per share) non-cash, after-tax write-down of long-lived assets; * a $52 million ($0.12 per share) non-cash, after-tax write-down of goodwill at Pajingo; * a $3 million ($0.01 per share) non-cash, after-tax net gain on the disposition of Perama and QMC; * a $62 million ($0.14 per share) net tax benefit resulting from the release of tax valuation allowances, tax true-ups and the filing of a consolidated tax return in Australia; and * a $16 million ($0.04 per share) non-cash, after-tax gain relating to FAS 143 reclamation estimate revisions. These items had the net effect of increasing net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 by $19 million ($0.04 per share). Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was impacted by the following items: * a $30 million ($0.07 per share) non-cash, after-tax loss on an inherited guarantee of QMC debt; * a $10 million ($0.02 per share) after-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt;
* an $18 million ($0.04 per share) non-cash, after-tax impairment charge at Golden Giant in Canada; and * a $72 million ($0.17 per share) tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances. These items had the net effect of increasing net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 by $14 million ($0.03 per share). For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold 1,797,900 equity ounces of gold, 5% higher than the prior year quarter gold sales of 1,715,100 equity ounces. The average realized gold price for the fourth quarter was $436 per ounce, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. For 2004, the Company sold 6,988,400 equity ounces of gold, 5% lower than 2003, largely as a result of increased stripping and lower grades in Nevada, the sale of non-core mines and the suspension of the Ovacik operations since August 2004. The average realized price for 2004 was $412 per ounce, a 13% increase over 2003. The Company generated net cash from operating activities of $587 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for 2004. Operating Highlights * Nevada operations sold 668,200 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (+7%) primarily due to increased tons milled and higher mill recoveries, offset by lower leach production and lower mill grades. Total cash costs of $265 per equity ounce (+20%) increased largely due to higher energy and maintenance costs. * Golden Giant in Canada sold 41,600 ounces in the fourth quarter (-39%) on lower ore grade (-34%) as the mine approaches closure. Total cash costs of $307 per ounce (+70%) increased due to lower production and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. * Holloway in Canada sold 19,000 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (+27%) due to an increase in throughput (+3%) and an increase in ore grade (+9%). Total cash costs per equity ounce were $360 (+2%) as increased labor and electricity costs and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar more than offset the higher production. * La Herradura in Mexico sold 17,400 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (+3%) at total cash costs of $116 per equity ounce (-15%).
* Yanacocha in Peru sold 436,000 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (+29%) from planned mining sequence changes that increased ore grades and inventory reduction resulting from the addition of three carbon columns in August 2004. Total cash costs of $124 per ounce (-2%) were favorably impacted by increased production, partially offset by higher diesel consumption and prices, increased consumption of reagents and higher royalties due to the increased gold price. * Kori Kollo in Bolivia sold 4,900 equity ounces in the fourth quarter (-65%) at total cash costs of $221 per equity ounce (+34%) as production continued from residual leaching. * The Australian and New Zealand operations sold 477,000 equity ounces in the fourth quarter. Total cash costs of $280 per equity ounce increased 25% from the year ago quarter, largely due to lower grades at Pajingo, stronger Australian and New Zealand dollars and higher diesel and consumable costs. * Kalgoorlie sold 123,100 equity ounces (+29%) due to higher production (+11%) and a reduction in inventory. Total cash costs of $297 per equity ounce (+12%) increased due to lower grades and recoveries as well as increased diesel and consumable costs. * Pajingo sold 69,400 ounces (-3%) at total cash costs of $232 per ounce (+61%). Total cash costs increased primarily due to increased tons milled (+7%), lower ore grade (-27%) and increased mine maintenance costs. * Tanami sold 152,200 ounces (+9%) due to an increase in mill throughput (+6%). Total cash costs of $322 per ounce (+32%) were higher due to lower grades and additional underground backfill costs. * Yandal sold 88,300 ounces (-33%) in the fourth quarter. The decrease was largely due to the sale of the Wiluna and Bronzewing mines in December 2003 and 2004, respectively. Total cash costs increased 8%, largely from higher consumable costs. * Martha in New Zealand sold 40,200 ounces (+14%) at total cash costs of $201 per ounce (+41%) as higher grades were more than offset by higher slope stability costs and consumable costs.
* Golden Grove sold 13.9 million pounds of copper (-51%) and 22.4 million pounds of zinc (-46%) due mainly to lower tons processed and the timing of shipments. Total cash costs per pound of copper ($1.01) and zinc ($0.35) increased 51% and 150%, respectively, primarily from higher ground support costs and lower production. * Effective January 1, 2004, the Company consolidated Batu Hijau and changed to co-product cost accounting for copper and gold, whereby specifically identifiable production costs are assigned for each product and any remaining costs are allocated in proportion to the sales revenue generated by each product. As a result, reported cash costs are impacted by relative movements in prices and production. * Effective October 1, 2004, Newmont's economic interest in Batu Hijau decreased to 52.875% from 56.25%, reflecting cumulative positive retained earnings at the end of the third quarter and the initiation of dividend payments to the minority partner. * Batu Hijau sold 86.9 million equity pounds of copper (+10%) and 94,600 equity ounces of gold (+43%) in the fourth quarter as a result of higher mill throughput (+12%) and higher ore grades (copper +5%, gold +28%), partially offset by lower recoveries. * Copper and gold total cash costs were $0.65 per pound and $124 per ounce, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Mining and processing costs were lower than the year ago quarter, but this was offset by increased treatment and refining charges and administrative costs. * Zarafshan in Uzbekistan sold 39,200 equity ounces (-15%) as a result of lower ore grade (-11%). Total cash costs of $157 per equity ounce (+9%) were higher due to lower production. * The Ovacik operations were suspended in August 2004 as a result of a Turkish court decision and pending completion of additional permitting requirements.
1. For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce and per pound and total production costs per ounce and per pound (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated and presented under GAAP, please refer to the Supplemental Information attached. 2. 2003 total cash costs for Batu Hijau included pro forma results to reflect the change to co-product accounting effective January 1, 2004. Other Highlights Cash, Marketable Securities and Debt At the end of the fourth quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion, essentially offsetting outstanding debt of $1.6 billion. Of the outstanding debt, $706 million was Batu Hijau project finance debt that is non-recourse to Newmont. During the fourth quarter, outstanding debt decreased by a net $93 million. At the close of markets on December 31, the value of the Company's marketable securities and other investments portfolio was $0.5 billion. Newmont Capital Newmont Capital manages the Company's royalty and marketable securities portfolios as well as asset transactions. For the fourth quarter, royalty and dividend income increased to $18.2 million (+17%). For 2004, royalty and dividend income was $65.8 million compared with $56.3 million in 2003. The increases primarily reflected higher precious metals, oil and gas prices and distributions from the Canadian Oil Sands Trust investment made in 2004. During the fourth quarter, Newmont Capital entered into or closed the following transactions and agreements: * the restructuring of the Company's obligations at QMC in Australia; * the sale of the Perama property in Greece; * the sale of the Company's interest in the Midwest Uranium joint venture in Canada; and * a private placement in Stratagold to fund exploration initiatives in Canada and Guyana. In February 2005, Newmont Capital entered into an agreement for the sale of Ovacik to a subsidiary of Koza Davetieye, a Turkish conglomerate. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter. Project Development The development of the Leeville underground project in Nevada remains on schedule with initial gold production expected in the fourth quarter of 2005. Ventilation shaft excavation work was completed during the fourth quarter. The production shaft is 88% complete to a depth of 1,610 feet. Development of ore access continues as does construction of support facilities underground. At Phoenix in Nevada, a ground-breaking ceremony in the fourth quarter was followed by the start of construction of the processing facilities. Engineering is approximately 75% complete with initial gold production expected in mid-2006.
At the Ahafo project in Ghana, engineering work is approximately 80% complete. Construction is approximately 20% complete with camp and infrastructure construction progressing along with earth works preparation for the mill, the tailings facility and the water storage dam. The Afaho project remains on schedule for initial gold production in the second half of 2006. At Akyem in Ghana, the feasibility study update is nearing completion and a development decision is expected by mid-2005. At Boddington in Australia, completion of the feasibility study update is expected by mid-2005. Exploration Exploration, research and development expenditures were $192.4 million in 2004, compared with $115.2 million in 2003. Newmont drilled 2.8 million feet (542 miles) during the year, resulting in discoveries that added 8.6 million equity ounces to reserves, with an additional 3.8 million equity ounces added from the $25 higher gold price assumption of $350 per ounce. Drilling at Ahafo intersected higher grade mineralization at depth in the south area, which will be followed up in 2005 with further drilling to test for open pit extension as well as underground mining potential. At Akyem, further drilling in 2005 will test new targets in the area. In Nevada, a 275-hole drill program at Phoenix resulted in the addition of 2.3 million ounces of reserves, expanding the pit shells and increasing the mine life from 13 years to 17 years. At Gold Quarry, infill drilling converted non-reserve material to reserves and, coupled with design changes of the Gold Quarry pit, maintained reserves of 6 million ounces after depletion of more than 600,000 ounces in 2004. In Peru, the Company added 4.5 million equity ounces of reserves at Minas Conga. Further drilling and optimization efforts are continuing at Minas Conga in 2005. At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, gold reserves were replaced, while the higher $0.90 per pound copper price assumption contributed to copper reserve additions that nearly replaced depletion. Drilling in 2005 in Australia and in New Zealand will focus on potential new deposits and on expanding mineralized zones at Tanami's Callie underground mine, Jundee, Pajingo and Martha. 2005 Guidance For 2005, the Company expects gold sales of between 6.6 million and 6.8 million equity ounces at total cash costs of between $235 and $245 per ounce. Lower expected equity gold sales are largely attributable to the assumed sale of Ovacik in the first quarter of 2005. Increased cash costs are primarily due to lower ore grades processed and slightly lower than expected recovery rates, as well as assumed ongoing US dollar weakness and higher consumable costs. The Company expects that equity sales for the second half of the year will be between 10% and 15% higher than the first half due to mine plan sequencing.
Guidance for exploration, research and development expenditures for 2005 is between $170 million and $200 million on a consolidated basis, reflecting continued optimization of feasibility studies at Minas Conga in Peru, and ongoing exploration and advanced study efforts at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana, as well as Elang and Martabe in Indonesia. The Company expects consolidated capital expenditures for 2005 of between $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, largely due to development investments in Ghana, Peru and Nevada.

5. Reconciliation of Costs Applicable to Sales to Total Cash Cost Per Ounce and Per Pound, and Total Production Costs Per Ounce and Per Pound (dollars in millions except per ounce amounts) The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.

Notes: (1) For more detailed descriptions, definitions and explanations, refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 to be filed in March 2005. (2) Prices quoted are gross contract prices, which represent the gross cash flow per ounce of each contract. Not included in these prices are the additional cash outflows associated with borrowing gold over the life of the contract where the contracts are floating in nature. The rate at which gold is borrowed is determined over the life of the contract based on the prevailing market gold lease rate for the time period that the borrowing is fixed. The borrowing can be fixed for varying periods over the life of the contract. (3) In addition to the gold hedge positions shown in the table above, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales contract in July 1999, which is reflected as debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Under the prepaid forward gold sales contract, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces of gold.
