The issuance and sale of Registered Securities and the related Guaranty have been registered under the registration statement referred to in Section 2(a). Particular series of the Registered Securities will be sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 in the form of Annex I attached hereto, for resale in accordance with terms of offering determined at the time of sale. The Registered Securities and related Guaranty are hereunder referred to as the "Securities". The firm or firms which agree to purchase the Securities are hereinafter referred to as the "Underwriters" of such Securities, and the representative or representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 are hereinafter referred to as the "Representatives"; provided, however, that if the Terms Agreement does not specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term "Representatives", as used in this Agreement (other than in Section 5(c) and the second sentence of Section 3) shall mean the Underwriters. The Company and the Guarantor have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement (File No. 333-112142), including a prospectus, relating to the Securities.

The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company and the Guarantor and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, when executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor will constitute the legal, valid and binding instrument of each of the Company and the Guarantor, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally, from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity.

Purchase and Offering of Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any Registered Securities, the obligation of the Guarantor to guarantee such Registered Securities and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be set forth in a Terms Agreement (the "Terms Agreement"), which shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be handwritten), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic, facsimile or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted at the time the Company determines to sell the Securities. The Terms Agreement will incorporate by reference the provisions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided therein, and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the names of any Representatives, the aggregate principal amount of the Registered Securities, the principal amount of Registered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter, the initial public offering price of the Registered Securities, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters and the terms of the Registered Securities not already specified in the Indenture, including, but not limited to, dates of payment and rate of interest, if any, maturity, any redemption or repayment provisions and any sinking fund requirements and whether any of the Securities may be sold to institutional investors pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined below). The Terms Agreement will also specify the time and date of delivery and payment (such time and date, or such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as the Representatives, the Company and the Guarantor agree as the time for payment and delivery, being herein and in the Terms Agreement referred to as the "Closing Date"), the place of delivery and payment and any details of the terms of offering that should be reflected in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Securities. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be several and not joint. It is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale as set forth in the Prospectus. The Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in definitive fully registered form, in such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request. -7-
If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, the Company and the Guarantor authorize the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Annex II attached hereto ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") with such changes therein as the Company and the Guarantor may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date, the Company or the Guarantor will pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the principal amount of Securities to be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts ("Contract Securities"). The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Company and the Guarantor execute and deliver Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract Securities will be deducted from the Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter will be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms Agreement, except to the extent that the Representatives determine that such reduction shall be otherwise than pro rata and shall so advise the Company and the Guarantor. The Company will advise the Representatives not later than 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date of the principal amount of Contract Securities. 4. Certain Agreements of the Company and the Guarantor. Each of the Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that in connection with each offering of Securities: (a) The Company and the Guarantor will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b). The Company and the Guarantor will file on a timely basis all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company or the Guarantor with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below); and the Company will furnish copies of the Prospectus to the Underwriters in New York City prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the business day next succeeding the date of the Terms Agreement or as promptly as practicable thereafter in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request. (b) The Company will deliver, without charge to each Underwriter (A) a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and each amendment thereto (without exhibits) and (B) during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of the Prospectus (including all amendments and supplements thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) as the Representatives may reasonably request. As used herein, the term "Prospectus Delivery Period" means such period of time after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters a prospectus relating to the Securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities by any Underwriter or dealer. -8-
(c) Before filing any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus during the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will furnish to the Representatives and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters ("Underwriters' Counsel"), a copy of the proposed amendment or supplement for review and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. (d) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will advise the Representatives promptly, and confirm such advice in writing, (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective; (ii) when any supplement to the Prospectus or any amendment to the Prospectus has been filed; (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or the receipt of any comments from the Commission relating to the Registration Statement or any other request by the Commission for any additional information; (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose; and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notice with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and the Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or suspending any such qualification of the Securities and, if any such order is issued, will obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (e) If during the Prospectus Delivery Period (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, the Company will immediately notify the Representatives thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to paragraph (c) above, file with the Commission and furnish to the Representatives and to such dealers as the Representatives may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5. (f) The Company will make generally available to its security holders and the Representatives as soon as practicable, an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder covering a period of at least twelve -9-
months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement. (g) The Company and the Guarantor will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale and the determination of their eligibility for investment under the securities and Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided, however, that in no event shall either the Company or the Guarantor be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities or to file a general or unlimited consent for service of process in any such jurisdiction. (h) The Company and the Guarantor will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's and the Guarantor's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Indenture, any Securities, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, any Blue Sky Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 4(g), including the reasonable fees and disbursements of Underwriters' Counsel in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee and any agent of any Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee in connection with any Indenture and the Securities; (viii) expenses incurred by the Company or the Guarantor in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder and under any Delayed Delivery Contracts which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section; provided, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 6 and Section 8 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. (i) For a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms Agreement and ending the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for the Securities, as notified to the Company and the Guarantor by the Representatives, and (ii) the Closing Date, without the prior consent of the Representatives, the Company and the Guarantor will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities substantially similar to the Securities. -10-
(j) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the Prospectus under the heading "Use of Proceeds". (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that could reasonably be expected to cause or result in any stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities. 5. Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Securities will be subject to the accuracy of the written statements of the officers of the Company and the Guarantor made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by each of the Company and the Guarantor of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent: (a) On the date of the Terms Agreement and on the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the request of the Company and the Guarantor, letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof and addressed to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; provided, that the letter delivered on the Closing Date may use a "cut-off" date no more than three business days prior to such Closing Date. (b) The Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission in accordance with the Securities Act and Section 4(a) of this Agreement. No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall be pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Guarantor, threatened by the Commission; and all requests by the Commission for additional information that affect the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representatives. (c) The representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor contained herein shall be true and correct on the date hereof and on and as of the Closing Date; and the statements of the Company and the Guarantor and their respective officers made in any certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date. (d) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any downgrading in the rating accorded any securities or preferred stock of or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantor by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review, or that it has changed its outlook with respect to, its rating of any securities or preferred stock of or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantor (other than an announcement with positive implications of a -11-
possible upgrading); or (ii) any event or condition of a type described in Section 2(d) hereof, which event or condition is not described in the Prospectus (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto) and the effect of which in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement or the Prospectus. (e) The Representatives shall have received on and as of the Closing Date a certificate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Executive Vice President, any Senior Vice President or any Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Accounting Officer of the Company and the Guarantor (i) confirming that such officers have carefully reviewed the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and, to the best knowledge of such officers, the representation set forth in Section 2(a) hereof is true and correct, (ii) confirming that the other representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct and that each of the Company and the Guarantor has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to such Closing Date and (iii) to the effect set forth in paragraphs (b) and (d) (i) above.

transfer or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), provided, however, that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to U.S. federal and state laws dealing with fraudulent conveyances; the related Guaranty has been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by the Guarantor; the Guaranty constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), provided, however, that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to U.S. federal and state laws dealing with fraudulent conveyances; and the Securities other than any Contract Securities conform, and any Contract Securities, when issued and delivered in the manner provided for in the Indenture and sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, will conform, in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus; (iii) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any New York State or Federal governmental agency or body or any New York State or Federal court having jurisdiction over either the Company or the Guarantor or any of its respective material properties is required to be obtained or made by either the Company or the Guarantor for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (as to which such counsel need express no opinion); (iv) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture, the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of either the Company or the Guarantor or any statute, rule, regulation or order applicable to the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries of which such counsel is aware of any federal or New York State governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective material properties (other than those that may be required under the Securities Act and under applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which such counsel need express no opinion), and the Company has full corporate power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Securities as contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and the Guarantor has full corporate power and authority to authorize and issue the Guaranty as contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement); -13-
(v) The Registration Statement was declared effective under the Securities Act as of the date and time specified in such opinion; the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act specified in such opinion on the date specified therein; and no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose is pending or, to the knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the Commission; (vi) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees", to the extent that they constitute summaries of the terms of the Securities, fairly summarize in all material respects the matters described therein; (vii) The registration statement relating to the Securities, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its date, appeared on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act; nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes it to believe that such registration statement, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, or any such amendment or supplement, as of its date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial or statistical data contained in any of the above-mentioned documents; and (viii) This Agreement, the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and any Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Company and the Guarantor. (g) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, from Sharon E. Thomas, Esq., Vice President and Secretary of the Company and Secretary of the Guarantor, to the effect that: (i) Each of the Company and each of the Significant Subsidiaries (including the Guarantor) has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing in its jurisdiction of organization and has been duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions in which its ownership of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification (except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect), and has all power and authority necessary to own its properties and conduct the business in which it is engaged as described in the Prospectus; -14-
(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture, the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries of which such counsel is aware of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective material properties or, any material agreement or instrument to which the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, the Guarantor or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company, the Guarantor or any such subsidiary is subject, or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, the Guarantor or any such subsidiary, which breach or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) Such counsel is not aware of any consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company, the Guarantor or any of their material properties that is required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Guarantor for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company and the Guarantor, except such as may be required under the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act and under state securities or Blue Sky laws (as to which such counsel need express no opinion); (iv) To the best knowledge of such counsel, except as described in the Prospectus, there are no legal, governmental or regulatory investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be the subject which, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and to the knowledge of such counsel, and except as described in the Prospectus, no such investigations, actions, suits or proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any governmental or regulatory authority or threatened by others; (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data contained therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act; and nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes him to believe that any of such documents, when such documents were so filed contained an untrue statement of a material fact and omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; -15-
(vi) Nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes him to believe that the Registration Statement relating to the Securities, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, or any such amendment or supplement, as of its date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and schedules or other financial or statistical data contained in any of the above-mentioned documents; and (vii) The statements contained in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K under the heading "Item 3. Legal Proceedings", and the statements contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the heading "Item 1. Legal Proceedings", in each case, which are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal documents, matters or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal documents, matters and proceedings; and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, (A) there are no current or pending legal, governmental or regulatory actions, suits or proceedings that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Prospectus and that are not so described and (B) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Prospectus and that have not been so filed or described. (h) The Representatives shall have received from Underwriters' Counsel, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company and the Guarantor, the validity of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require, and the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (i) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives such further certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. All opinions, letters, certificates and evidence mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters. The Company and the Guarantor will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning -16-
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; provided, that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter to the extent that the sale to the person asserting of any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial resale by such Underwriter and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to such Underwriter results from the fact that both (i) to the extent required by applicable law, a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company with the provisions of Section 4 hereof. (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor and their respective directors and officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter agreed to be furnished to the Company in writing by the Representatives pursuant to the Terms Agreement. (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, -17-
the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company and the Guarantor and their respective directors and officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company or the Guarantor shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on -18-
the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. 7. Termination. This Agreement and the Terms Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Terms Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantor shall have been suspended on any exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Terms Agreement and the Prospectus. -19-
8. Default of Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Terms Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company and the Guarantor that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Terms Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Registered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Registered Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Registered Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Registered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Terms Agreement relating to such Registered Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Registered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Terms Agreement) of the Registered Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Registered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Registered Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Registered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Terms Agreement relating to such Registered Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4(h) and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 6; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. -20-
9. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor or their officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters under the Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company and the Guarantor shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(h) and the respective obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason, other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of any event specified in Section 8, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Securities, but the Company and the Guarantor shall be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 6. 10. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects, if delivered or sent by first class mail, telex, or facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing by overnight courier sent on the day of such facsimile transmission) to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Terms Agreement; and if to the Company or the Guarantor shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by first class mail or facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing by overnight courier sent on the day of such facsimile transmission) to the address of the Company and the Guarantor set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. 11. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, the Guarantor and such Underwriters as are identified in Terms Agreements and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6, and no other person will acquire or have any right or obligation hereunder or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign merely by reason of such purchase. 12. Representatives. In all dealings under any Terms Agreement and hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any underwriter made or given by the Representatives. 13. Certain Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except where otherwise expressly provided, the term "affiliate" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (b) the term "business day" means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City; and (c) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. 14. Time of Essence. Time shall be of the essence of each Terms Agreement. -21-
15. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH TERMS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 16. Counterparts. This Agreement and each Terms Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts (which may include counterparts delivered by any standard form of telecommunication), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 17. Amendments or Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or each Terms Agreement, nor any consent or approval to any departure therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. 18. Headings.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the Securities and the indenture. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The Company will mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each registered holder of the Securities to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the securities. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (A) Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by DTC, in the case of Securities represented by a global security, or by the trustee by a method the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of Securities that are not represented by a global security.

any terms and conditions for the conversion of such Securities which differ from Article Eleven; and (16) any other terms of the series which are not inconsistent with this Indenture. In the case of Securities of a series issued in Tranches, all Securities of any one Tranche shall be substantially identical, except as to denomination. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination, interest rate and maturity and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Resolution or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. The applicable Resolution or the applicable supplemental indenture may provide that Securities of any particular series may be issued at various times, with different maturities and redemption and repayment provisions (if any) and bearing interest at different rates, but shall for all purposes under this Indenture, including, but not limited to, voting and Events of Default, be treated as Securities of a single series. Except as otherwise specified pursuant to this Section 2.6 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. SECTION 2.7 Authentication and Delivery of Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication, with, in each case, the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and make available for delivery such Securities to or upon the written order of the Issuer, signed by both (a) its chief executive officer, its president, any executive vice president or any senior vice president and (b) its treasurer, its controller or its secretary, without any further action by the Issuer. In authenticating such Securities and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) shall be fully protected in relying upon: (1) a copy of any Resolution or Resolutions relating to such series, certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of each of the Issuer and the Guarantor; (2) an executed supplemental indenture, if any, relating thereto; (3) an Officers' Certificate of the Issuer setting forth the form and terms of the Securities as required pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.6, respectively, and prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and Section 13.5; (4) an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and Section 13.5, which shall state that (i) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to a Resolution of the Issuer as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form or forms, as the case may be, have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture, and that the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to a Resolution of the Issuer as permitted -19-
by Section 2.6 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture and that the authentication and delivery of such Securities by the Trustee is authorized under the provisions of this Indenture and (ii) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and (5) an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and Section 13.5, which shall state that the Guaranty endorsed upon such Securities, when such Securities are authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Issuer or if the Trustee in good faith by a trust committee of Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders or would adversely affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate Securities denominated in a coin or currency other than that of the United States of America if the Trustee reasonably determines that such Securities impose duties or obligations on the Trustee which the Trustee is not able or reasonably willing to accept; provided that the Trustee, upon the request of the Issuer, will resign as Trustee with respect to Securities of any series as to which such a determination is made, prior to the issuance of such Securities, and will comply with the request of the Issuer to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture appointing a successor Trustee pursuant to Section 7.1. If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.6 that the Securities of a series or a Tranche are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the order of the Issuer with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities, in each case with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor, that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series or such Tranche, as the case may be, issued and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such -20-
Depositary's instructions and (iv) shall bear such legend, if any, as shall be required by the Depositary. Each Depositary of a Global Security designated pursuant to Section 2.6 must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary hereunder, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation. SECTION 2.8 Execution of Securities. The Securities shall be signed on behalf of the Issuer by its chairman of the Board of Directors and chief executive officer, its president, any executive vice president, any senior vice president or its treasurer, under its corporate seal which shall be attested by the secretary or any assistant secretary of the Issuer. Such signatures may be the manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such officers. The seal of the Issuer may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. In case any officer of the Issuer who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before the Security so signed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer; and any Security may be signed on behalf of the Issuer by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer. SECTION 2.9 Certificate of Authentication. Unless a certificate of authentication, substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, set forth on a Security has been executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, such Security shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and neither such Security nor the Guaranty endorsed thereon shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. SECTION 2.10 Execution and Delivery of Guaranty. To evidence the Guaranty to the Securityholders hereunder, the Guaranty, substantially in the form provided in Section 2.4, shall be endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered hereunder. The Guaranty endorsed upon each such Security shall be signed in the name of the Guarantor by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, any vice president or the treasurer of the Guarantor. Such signature may be the manual or facsimile signature of the present or any future such officers. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the Guaranty endorsed upon any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. In case any officer of the Guarantor who shall have signed any Guaranty shall cease to hold such office before the Security on which such Guaranty is endorsed shall be -21-
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed such Guaranty had not ceased to hold such office; and the Guaranty on any Security may be signed in the name of the Guarantor by such Persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Guaranty, shall be the proper officers of the Guarantor, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer. SECTION 2.11 Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest. The Securities of each series shall be issuable as registered securities without coupons and in denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.6. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of U.S.$1,000 (or, if such Securities are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars or in a composite currency, 1,000 units of such other currency or composite currency) and any multiple thereof. The Securities of each series shall be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Issuer executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, shall bear interest, if any, from the date, and shall be payable on the dates, in each case, which shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.6. Except as otherwise specified for a particular series pursuant to Section 2.6, the Person in whose name any Security of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date (as hereinafter defined) applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Security upon any registration of any transfer or exchange of such Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names Outstanding Securities of such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of any particular series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day. SECTION 2.12 Registration, Transfer and Exchange. The Issuer will keep, either at the office or agency designated and maintained by the Issuer for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of, Securities of a -22-
series as in this Article provided. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and any Security registrar (as defined below) other than the Trustee. Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute (in each case with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor) and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount and having the same interest rate, maturity and repayment and redemption provisions. Any Security or Securities of any series (other than a Global Security, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a Security or Securities of the same series in other authorized denominations, in an equal aggregate principal amount and having the same interest rate, maturity, redemption and repayment provisions. Securities of any series to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, and the Issuer shall execute (in each case with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor) and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor the Security or Securities of the same series and having the same interest rate, maturity and repayment and redemption provisions which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers or other distinguishing symbols not contemporaneously outstanding. Each Person designated by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2 as a Person authorized to register and register transfer of the Security is sometimes herein referred to as a "Security registrar". The Issuer will at all times designate one Person (who may be the Issuer and who need not be a Security registrar) to act as repository of a master list of names and addresses of the Holders of the Securities (the "Register"). The Trustee shall act as such repository unless and until some other Person is, by written notice from the Issuer to the Trustee and each Security registrar, designated by the Issuer to act as such. The Issuer shall cause each Security registrar to furnish to such repository, on a current basis, such information as to all registrations of transfer and exchanges effected by such registrar, as may be necessary to enable such repository to maintain the Register on as current a basis as is practicable. No Person shall at any time be designated as or act as a Security registrar unless such Person is at such time empowered under applicable law to act as such and duly registered to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations. All Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer or exchange in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Securityholder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. -23-
The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.15, 7.5 or 10.3 not involving any registration of transfer. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction. The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption or surrendered for repayment in whole or in part except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed or repaid in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed or repaid. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.12, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary. If at any time the Depositary for any Securities of a series represented by one or more Global Securities notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Securities shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.7, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Securities. If a successor Depositary for such Securities is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer's election pursuant to Section 2.6 that such Securities be represented by one or more Global Securities shall no longer be effective and the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and make available for delivery definitive Securities of the same series, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such Securities, in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. The Issuer may at any time, and in its sole discretion, determine that Securities issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Securities. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities, will authenticate and make available for delivery definitive Securities of the same series, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Global Security or Securities, in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. If specified by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.6 with respect to Securities represented by a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for definitive Securities of the same series on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, without service charge: -24-
(i) to the Person specified by such Depositary, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above. Upon the exchange of a Global Security for definitive Securities, in authorized denominations, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee. Definitive Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall make such Securities available for delivery to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered. SECTION 2.13 Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen and, in the absence of notice to the Issuer or the Trustee that any destroyed, lost or stolen Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Issuer may in its discretion execute (with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor) and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor, bearing a number or other distinguishing symbol not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee (and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee, if requested by the Issuer or the Guarantor) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof. Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security that has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee (and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee, if requested by the Issuer or the Guarantor) such security or indemnity as any of them may require to indemnify and defend and to save each -25-
of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof. Every substituted Security of any series and the Guaranty endorsed thereon issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer and the Guarantor, respectively, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender. SECTION 2.14 Cancellation of Securities Paid, etc. All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, registration of transfer, conversion or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer, any Security registrar, any paying agent, any conversion agent, or any other agent of the Issuer or any agent of the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee and promptly canceled by it or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly canceled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of such canceled Securities in its customary manner. If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. SECTION 2.15 Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced)(with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as registered Securities without coupons, in any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer and the Guarantor. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute definitive Securities of such series and the Issuer shall furnish (with, in each case, the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor) such definitive securities and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations having the same interest rate, maturity and redemption and repayment -26-
provisions, and bearing interest from the same date as such temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 2.16 CUSIP Numbers. The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Securityholders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers. SECTION 2.17 Form of Election to Convert. The notice of conversion to be delivered by a Holder to the conversion agent in connection with the conversion of Securities of any series that are convertible into shares of Common Stock shall be in substantially the following form, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are deemed necessary or appropriate by the Issuer or the Trustee: Notice of Conversion The undersigned Holder of the Securities specified below hereby irrevocably exercises the option to convert such Securities, or the aggregate principal amount thereof specified below, into shares of Common Stock of the Issuer, in accordance with the terms of the Securities and the Indenture dated as of ___________, (the "Indenture") among Newmont Mining Corporation, as issuer, Newmont USA Limited, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A. as Trustee, and directs that if such Holder is electing to receive Common Stock, the Common Stock issuable and deliverable upon conversion be delivered to such Holder unless otherwise indicated below and any check in payment for fractional shares be issued in the name of and delivered to the undersigned unless a different name has been indicated below.

The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of and interest, if any, on each of the Securities of such series at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities and in a manner consistent with the applicable requirements of The Depository Trust Company. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.6 for Securities of any series, each installment of interest on the Securities of any series may be paid by mailing checks for such interest payable to the Person entitled thereto as such addresses shall appear in the Register. SECTION 3.2 Offices for Payments, etc. So long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the Issuer will designate and maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for each series: (a) an office or agency where the Securities may be presented for payment or conversion, (b) an office or agency where the Securities may be presented for regis- - --------------- 1 Unless otherwise specified, a Holder will be deemed to be converting the entire principal amount of the Securities delivered. 2 Certificate registered in the name of the Holder will be issued in the principal amount of the Securities not converted, unless otherwise provided. -28-
tration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided and (c) an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities or of this Indenture may be served. In addition to such office or offices or agency or agencies, the Issuer may from time to time designate and maintain one or more additional offices or agencies within or outside the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where the Securities of that series may be presented for payment or for registration of transfer or for exchange, and the Issuer may from time to time rescind such designation, as it may deem desirable or expedient. The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of any such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. The Issuer hereby designates the New York Location and the Corporate Trust Office as the initial offices to be maintained by it for such purposes. In case the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office and the Issuer appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. SECTION 3.3 Paying Agents. Whenever the Issuer shall appoint a paying agent or agents other than the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series, it will cause each such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which each such paying agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, (a) that it will hold all sums received by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Issuer or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, (b) that it will give the Trustee notice of any default by the Issuer (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable, and (c) that, at any time during the continuance of any such default referred to in clause (b) above, upon the written request of the Trustee, it will forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent. Whenever the Issuer shall have one or more paying agents with respect to Securities of any series, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series, deposit with a designated paying agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal or interest, if any, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action. If the Issuer shall act as its own paying agent with respect to the Securities of any series, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal and interest, if any, a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest, if any, so -29-
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action. Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge with respect to one or more or all series of Securities hereunder, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust for any such series by the Issuer or any paying agent hereunder, as required by this Section, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained. Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section is subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 9.4. SECTION 3.4 Limitation on Liens. The Issuer will not itself, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any indebtedness for money borrowed or any other indebtedness evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures or other similar evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed (hereinafter in this Section and in Section 3.5 called "Debt") secured by pledge of, or mortgage, deed of trust or other lien on, any Principal Property owned by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or any shares of stock or other ownership interests or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (such pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other liens being hereinafter in this Section and in Section 3.5 called "Mortgage" or "Mortgages"), without effectively providing that the Securities of all series (together with, if the Issuer shall so determine, any other Debt of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary then existing or thereafter created which is not subordinate to the Securities) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) such secured Debt, so long as such secured Debt shall be so secured, unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all such secured Debt which would otherwise be prohibited, plus all Attributable Debt of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of sale and leaseback transactions (as defined in Section 3.5) which would otherwise be prohibited by Section 3.5 would not exceed the sum of 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; provided, that this Section shall not apply to, and there shall be excluded from secured Debt in any computation under this Section, Debt secured by: (a) Mortgages on property of, or on any shares of stock or other ownership interests or Debt of, any corporation or any other entity existing at the time such corporation or entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (b) Mortgages to secure indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or to another Restricted Subsidiary; (c) Mortgages for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies in each case (i) not then due and delinquent or (ii) the validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and materialmen's, mechanics', carriers', workmen's, repairmen's, landlords' or other like Mortgages, or deposits to obtain the release of such Mortgages; (d) Mortgages arising under an order of attachment or distraint or similar legal process so long as the execution or enforcement thereof is effectively stayed and the -30-

deemed to constitute secured Debt and, shall not be included in any computation under these restrictions. SECTION 3.5 Limitation on Sales and Leasebacks. The Issuer will not itself, and it will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any bank, insurance company or other lender or investor (not including the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or to which any such lender or investor is a party, providing for the leasing by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary for a period, including renewals, in excess of three years, of any Principal Property owned by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary which has been or is to be sold or transferred more than 270 days after the acquisition thereof or after the completion of construction and commencement of full operation thereof, by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary to such lender or investor or to any person to whom funds have been or are to be advanced by such lender or investor on the security of such Principal Property (herein referred to as a "sale and leaseback transaction") unless either: (a) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary could create Debt secured by a Mortgage on the Principal Property to be leased back in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such sale and leaseback transaction without equally and ratably securing the Securities of all series pursuant to Section 3.4, or (b) the Issuer within 180 days after the sale or transfer shall have been made by the Issuer or by any such Restricted Subsidiary, applies an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net proceeds of the sale of the Principal Property sold and leased back pursuant to such arrangement or (ii) the fair market value of the Principal Property so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such arrangement (as determined by any two of the following: the chairman, the president, the executive vice president, any senior vice president, the treasurer, the controller or the secretary of the Issuer) to (x) the purchase of property, facilities or equipment (other than the property, facilities or equipment involved in such sale) having a value at least equal to the net proceeds of such sale or (y) the retirement of Funded Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that the amount required to be applied to the -------- retirement of Funded Debt of the Issuer shall be reduced by (i) the principal amount of any Securities of any series (or, if the Securities of any series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be due and payable with respect to such series pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 4.l or if the Securities of any series provide that an amount other than the face thereof will or may be payable upon the maturity thereof or a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof, such amount as may be due and payable with respect to such securities pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 4.1.) delivered within 180 days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation, and (ii) the principal amount of Funded Debt, other than the Securities of any series, voluntarily retired by the Issuer within 180 days after such sale or transfer.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer's or the Guarantor's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). SECTION 3.9 Compliance Certificates. (a) On or before April 15 in each year (commencing with the first April 15 which is not less than 60 days following the first date of issuance of Securities of any series under this Indenture), each of the Issuer and the Guarantor will file with the Trustee a brief certificate, signed by its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or principal accounting officer, stating whether or not the signer has knowledge of any default by the Issuer or the Guarantor, respectively, in the performance or fulfillment of any covenant, agreement, or condition contained in this Indenture, and, if so, specifying each such default of which the signer has knowledge, the nature thereof, and what action, if any, has been taken and is proposed to be taken to cure such default.

ARTICLE FOUR REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND SECURITYHOLDERS ON EVENT OF DEFAULT SECTION 4.1 Events of Default. "Event of Default" with respect to Securities of a particular series wherever used herein, means any one of the following events and such other events as may be established with respect to the Securities of such series as contemplated by Sec- -33-
tion 2.6, continued for the period of time, if any, and after the giving of notice, if any, designated in this Indenture or as may be established with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 2.6, as the case may be, unless such event is either inapplicable or is specifically deleted or modified in, or pursuant to, the applicable Resolution or in the supplemental indenture under which such series of Securities is issued, as the case may be, as contemplated by Section 2.6: (a) default in the payment of any installment of interest, if any, upon any of the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (b) default in the payment of the principal of any of the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable either at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise; or (c) default in the payment of any sinking fund installment as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the Securities of such series; or (d) failure on the part of the Issuer or the Guarantor duly to observe or perform any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, in respect of the Securities of such series contained in this Indenture (other than a covenant or agreement in respect of the Securities of such series a default in the performance of which or a breach of which is elsewhere in this Section specifically addressed), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Issuer and the Guarantor by the Trustee or to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (e) a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantor in an involuntary case under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Issuer or the Guarantor or for all or substantially all of its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (f) the Issuer or the Guarantor shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent to the appointment or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Issuer or the Guarantor, respectively, or for all or substantially all of its property, or make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (g) the Guaranty with respect to the Securities of such series ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or the Guarantor -34-
denies or disaffirms its obligations under such Guaranty. If an Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all of the Securities of such series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, by notice in writing to the Issuer and the Guarantor (and to the Trustee if given by Securityholders), may declare the entire principal amount (or, if the Securities of such series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms of such series or if so provided pursuant to Section 2.6 for Securities of any series, such other amount as is specified pursuant thereto) of all of the Securities of such series and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable. The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal (or, if the Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof or if so provided pursuant to Section 2.6 for Securities of any series, such other amount as is specified pursuant thereto) of the Securities of any series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, (a) the Issuer or the Guarantor shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest, if any, upon all the Securities of such series and the principal of any and all Securities of such series which shall have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration (with interest upon such principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest, if any, at the Overdue Rate applicable to such series to the date of such payment or deposit), and all amounts payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.5, and (b) any and all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to such series of Securities other than the non-payment of the principal of such Securities which shall have become due by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein or provision shall have been made therefor to the satisfaction of the Trustee, then and in every such case the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences with respect to such series, but no such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon. For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due -35-
and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities. If the Securities of any series provide the amount other than the face amount thereof will be payable upon the maturity thereof or a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof, for purposes of this Section 4.1 the principal amount of such Securities shall be deemed to be such amount as shall be due and payable upon the acceleration of the of the maturity thereof, except as may otherwise be provided with respect to such Securities pursuant to Section 2.6. If the Securities of any series provide that an amount other than the face amount thereof will be payable upon the maturity thereof or upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof, for purposes of this Section 4.1 the principal amount of such Securities shall be deemed to be such amount as shall be due and payable upon the acceleration of the maturity thereof, except as may otherwise be provided with respect to such Securities pursuant to Section 2.6. SECTION 4.2 Payment of Securities on Default; Suit Therefor. The Issuer covenants that (a) in case a default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of any series as and when such interest shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days or (b) in case a default shall be made in the payment of the principal of any of the Securities of any series as and when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of such series or upon redemption or by declaration or otherwise, or (c) in case of a default in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation when the same becomes due by the terms of the Securities of any series -- then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Issuer will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series the whole amount then due and payable on all Securities of such series for principal and interest, if any, as the case may be (with interest to the date of such payment upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest, if any, at the Overdue Rate applicable to Securities of such series); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and any further amounts payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.5. Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Issuer may pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of any series to the registered Holders, whether or not the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of such series be overdue. In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Issuer or other obligor upon such Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable. -36-
In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other similar applicable Federal or state law, or in case a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar official shall have been appointed for the property of the Issuer, the Guarantor or such other obligor, or in case of any other similar judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer, the Guarantor or other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer, the Guarantor or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Securities of any series are Original Issue Discount Securities or if the Securities of any series provide that an amount other than the face thereof will or may be payable upon maturity thereof or upon a declaration of acceleration thereof, such amount as may be due and payable with respect to such series pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 4.1) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any series, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for any amounts payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.5) and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relating to the Issuer, the Guarantor or other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer, the Guarantor or such other obligor, (b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of any series in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or of a person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings, and (c) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and of the Trustee on their behalf (after deduction of costs and expenses of collection, and any further amounts payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.5 and incurred by it up to the date of distribution); and any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Securityholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee costs and expenses of collection, and any further amounts payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.5 and incurred by it up to the date of distribution. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person. -37-
All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under the Securities of any series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities of such series or the production thereof on any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such action was taken. In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings in which a declaratory judgment of a court may be sought as to the interpretation or construction of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Securities to which such proceedings relate, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Securities parties to any such proceedings. SECTION 4.3 Application of Monies Collected by Trustee. Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in the case of distribution of such monies on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the several Securities in respect of which monies have been collected and stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the payment, or issuing Securities in reduced principal amounts in exchange for the presented Securities of like series (or, in the case of Securities of a series issued in more than one Tranche, of the same Tranche) and tenor if only partially paid, or upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.5; SECOND: In case the principal of the Outstanding Securities in respect of which monies have been collected shall not have become and be then due and payable, to the payment of interest, if any, on the Securities in default in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee and to the extent permitted by applicable law) upon the overdue installments of interest at the Overdue Rate applicable to such Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the persons entitled thereto, without discrimination or preference; THIRD: In case the principal of the Outstanding Securities in respect of which monies have been collected shall have become and shall be then due and payable by declaration or otherwise, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon such Securities for principal and interest, if any, with interest upon the overdue principal, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee and to the extent permitted by applicable law) upon overdue installments of interest, if any, at the Overdue Rate applicable to such Securities; and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon such Securities, then to the payment of such principal and interest, if any, without preference or priority of principal over interest, if any, or of interest, if any, over principal, or of any installment of interest, if any, over any other installment of interest, if any, or of any Security over any other Security, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any; and -38-
FOURTH: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Issuer or, to the extent that such monies were provided by the Guarantor, to the Guarantor, or to their respective successors and assigns. SECTION 4.4 Proceedings by Trustee. In case an Event of Default hereunder has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law. SECTION 4.5 Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings. In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken. SECTION 4.6 Proceedings by Securityholders. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default with respect to Securities of such series and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceedings in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.8 during such 60 day period; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of any Securities shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holder of Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other Holder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities of the applicable series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity. SECTION 4.7 Remedies Cumulative and Continuing. Except as provided in Section 4.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Security- -39-
holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Securityholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to Section 4.6, every power and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Securityholders of any or all series, as the case may be, may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders of such series or all series, as the case may be. SECTION 4.8 Control by Securityholders. The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected at the time Outstanding (with each such series voting separately as a class) shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee by this Indenture with respect to Securities of such series. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no such direction shall be otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of this Indenture and (subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of such Securities not taking part in such direction, or the Holders of the Securities of any other series, or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the Trustee shall determine that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions by Securityholders. SECTION 4.9 Waiver of Past Defaults. Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Securities of any particular series the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such particular series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such particular series waive any past default or Event of Default with respect to such particular series and its consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected as provided in Section 7.2. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of each series affected shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. -40-
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for every purpose of this Indenture. ARTICLE FIVE CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE SECTION 5.1 Reliance on Documents, Opinions, etc.; No Requirement for Expenditure of Own Funds. Subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939: (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default, and in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein); (b) any request, direction, order or demand of the Issuer and the Guarantor mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any Resolution may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable; (c) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and any advice of such counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel; (d) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby; (e) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document unless requested in writing so to do by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series affected then Outstanding, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled -41-
to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney at the sole cost of the Company and shall incur no liability or additional liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation; provided that, if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it against such expenses or liabilities as a condition to proceeding; and the reasonable expenses of every such investigation shall be paid by the Issuer or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be promptly repaid by the Issuer upon demand; (f) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys who are not employees of it and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (g) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document (whether in its original or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (h) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered, or omitted to be taken by it in the absence of negligence or bad faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture (i) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture (j) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee (k) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error or judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts (l) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder; and (m) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate -42-
setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded. None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall be construed as requiring the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. SECTION 5.2 No Responsibility for Recitals, etc. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer and the Guarantor, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities, provided that the Trustee shall not be relieved of its duty to authenticate Securities only as authorized by this Indenture. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Issuer and the Guarantor of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof. SECTION 5.3 Trustee and Agents May Hold Securities. The Trustee or any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent and, subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, may otherwise deal with the Issuer and the Guarantor and receive, collect, hold and retain collections from the Issuer and the Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent. SECTION 5.4 Monies to Be Held in Trust. Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 9.4, all monies received by the Trustee or any paying agent, all money and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.8 and all money received by the Trustee in respect of U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.8, shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law. Neither the Trustee nor any paying agent shall be under any liability for interest on any monies received by it hereunder, except such as it may agree in writing with the Issuer to pay thereon. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all interest allowed on any such monies shall be paid from time to time upon the written order of the Issuer signed by one of its officers, who is one of the officers who may sign an Officers' Certificate. SECTION 5.5 Compensation, Indemnification and Expenses of Trustee. The Issuer and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, covenant and agree to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, such compensation as shall be agreed to from time to time in writing by the Issuer and the Trustee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and, except as otherwise -43-
expressly provided, the Issuer will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by or on behalf of it in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be caused by its negligence or bad faith. The Issuer and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, also covenant to fully indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense, including reasonable legal fees and expenses and taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the Trustee) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder and its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Issuer, the Guarantor, a Holder or any other Person) or liability in the premises. The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee. Such additional indebtedness shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular Securities. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 4.1(e) or Section 4.1(f), the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law. SECTION 5.6 Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate, etc. Subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, whenever in the administration of the trusts of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof. SECTION 5.7 Eligibility of Trustee. The Trustee for each series of Securities hereunder shall at all times be a corporation which complies with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, having a combined capital and surplus of at least U.S.$50,000,000. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation at any time shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 5.8. -44-
SECTION 5.8 Resignation or Removal of Trustee; Appointment of Successor Trustee. (a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and the Guarantor. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor trustee or trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee or trustees. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may, at the expense of the Issuer, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee. (b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur: (i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7 with respect to any series of Securities and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or the Guarantor or by any Securityholder; or (ii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; then, in any such case, the Issuer by Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities (or all series, if required) and appoint a successor trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee with respect to such series. (c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Issuer and the Guarantor the evidence provided for in Section 6.1 of the action in that regard taken by the Securityholders. -45-
If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may, at the expense of the Issuer, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee. (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 5.8 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 5.9. SECTION 5.9 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee. Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 5.8 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Issuer, the Guarantor and its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the successor trustee, upon payment (or due provision therefor) of any amounts then due it pursuant to Section 5.5, the predecessor Trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 9.4, pay over to the successor trustee all monies at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.5. If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the Guarantor, the predecessor Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such trustee. No successor trustee with respect to any series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 5.9 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall, with respect to such series, be qualified under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 5.7. -46-
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 5.9, the Issuer shall mail notice thereof to the Holders of Securities of any series for which such successor trustee is acting as trustee at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Register. If the Issuer fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the Issuer's expense. SECTION 5.10 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided, that such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 5.7, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee by merger, conversion or consolidation may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of such successor to the Trustee or, if such successor to the Trustee is a successor by merger, conversion or consolidation, in the name of any predecessor hereunder; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which the certificate of the Trustee shall have as provided anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture. SECTION 5.11 Reports by Trustee to Securityholders. Within 60 days after December 31 in each year, beginning with the December 31 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to the Securityholders a brief report dated as of such reporting date in compliance with ss. 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 if such report is required by Section ss. 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with ss. 313(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by ss. 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Securities are listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof. ARTICLE SIX CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS SECTION 6.1 Action by Securityholders. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action) the fact that at the time of taking any such action the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced (a) by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such -47-
Securityholders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by the record of such Holders of Securities voting in favor thereof at any meeting of such Securityholders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of this Article, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of such Securityholders; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments and/or such record are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent or proxy shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and Section 5.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor, if made in the manner provided in this Article. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have taken any action (including the making of any demand or request), the giving of any notice, consent or waiver (or the taking of any other action) hereunder and in determining voting rights of any Holder of a Security hereunder (i) the principal amount of Original Issue Discount Securities that shall be deemed to be Outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 4.1, (ii) in the case of Securities which provide that an amount other than the face amount thereof will or may be payable upon the maturity thereof or upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof, the principal amount of such Securities that shall be deemed to be Outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount that would be due and payable in respect of such Securities as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 4.1, and (iii) the principal amount of any Security, the principal amount of which is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars or in units of currencies or in a composite currency (the "Specified Currency") shall be deemed to be that amount of U.S. dollars which could have been obtained by the face amount of such Specified Currency at the Market Exchange Rate. For purposes of this Section 6.1, "Market Exchange Rate" means, unless otherwise specified for a Specified Currency with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.6, the noon U.S. dollar buying rate in New York City for cable transfers of the Specified Currency published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. All decisions and determinations of the Trustee regarding the Market Exchange Rate or any alternative determination provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive to the extent permitted by law for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Issuer, the Guarantor and all Securityholders. If the Issuer shall solicit from the Securityholders any demand, request, notice, consent, waiver or the taking of any other action (other than in accordance with the Securityholders voting provisions set forth in Sections 6.6 through 6.14 of this Article), the Issuer may, at its option, by a Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such demand, request, notice, consent or waiver or to take such other action, but the Issuer shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such demand, request, notice, consent, waiver or such other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite percentage of -48-
Securities Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such demand, request, notice, consent, waiver or taking of any other action, and for that purpose the Securities Outstanding shall be computed as of the record date; provided, that no such demand, request, notice, consent, waiver or taking of any other action by the Holders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. SECTION 6.2 Proof of Execution by Securityholders. Subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and Sections 5.1 and 6.11, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy shall be sufficient if made in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Register or by a certificate of the Person designated by the Issuer to keep the Register and to act as repository in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12. The record of any Securityholders' meeting shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 6.12. SECTION 6.3 Holders to Be Treated as Owners. The Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Security shall be registered in the Register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes; and none of the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such Person, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for monies payable upon any such Security. SECTION 6.4 Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any demand, request, notice, direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such demand, request, notice, direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for purposes of this Section 6.4 if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such -49-
right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and Section 5.1, the Trustee shall, in the absence of manifest error, accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination. SECTION 6.5 Right of Revocation of Action Taken. At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 6.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number or other distinguishing symbol of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers or other distinguishing symbols of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action. SECTION 6.6 Securityholders' Meetings; Purposes. A meeting of Holders of Securities of any series or all series, as the case may be, may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Article Six for any of the following purposes: (1) to give any notice to the Issuer, the Guarantor or to the Trustee, or to give any directions to the Trustee, or to consent to the waiving of any default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences, or to take any other action authorized to be taken by Securityholders pursuant to any of the provisions of Article Four; (2) to remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee pursuant to the provisions of Article Five; (3) to consent to the execution of an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2; or (4) to take any other action authorized to be taken by or on behalf of the Holders of any specified aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series or all series, as the case may be, under any other provision of this Indenture or under applicable law. SECTION 6.7 Call of Meetings by Trustee. The Trustee may at any time call a -50-
meeting of Holders of Securities of any series or all series, as the case may be, to take any action specified in Section 6.6, to be held at such time and at such place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as the Trustee shall determine. Notice of every meeting of the Holders of Securities of any series or all series, as the case may be, setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, shall be mailed to Holders of Outstanding Securities of each series affected at their addresses as they shall appear in the Register as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the mailing of such notice. Such notice shall be mailed not less than 20 nor more than 90 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting. Any meeting of the Holders of Securities of any series or all series, as the case may be, shall be valid without notice if the Holders of all Securities of any series then Outstanding are present in person or by proxy, or, if notice is waived before or after the meeting by the Holders of all Securities of any series outstanding, and if the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee are either present by duly authorized representatives or have, before or after the meeting waived notice. SECTION 6.8 Call of Meetings by Issuer or Securityholders. In case at any time the Issuer, pursuant to a Resolution, or the Holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of any or all series, as the case may be, shall have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of the Holders of Securities of such series or all series, as the case may be, by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not have mailed the notice of such meeting within 20 days after receipt of such request, then the Issuer or such Securityholders, in the amount specified above, may determine the time and the place in said Borough of Manhattan for such meeting and may call such meeting to take any action authorized in Section 6.6, by mailing notice thereof as provided in Section 6.7. SECTION 6.9 Qualifications for Voting. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Securityholders a Person shall (a) be a Holder of one or more Securities with respect to which such meeting is being held or (b) be a Person appointed by an instrument in writing as proxy by a Holder of one or more such Securities. The only Persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Securityholders shall be the Persons entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel and any representatives of the Trustee and its counsel and any representatives of the Issuer and the Guarantor and their respective counsel. SECTION 6.10 Quorum; Adjourned Meetings.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. Promptly after the execution by the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.2, the Issuer shall mail a notice thereof to the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby at their addresses as they shall appear in the Register, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Issuer to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture. SECTION 7.3 Effect of Supplemental Indenture. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Issuer (with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor), authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such series then Outstanding. ARTICLE EIGHT CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE, CONVEYANCE AND LEASE SECTION 8.1 Issuer and Guarantor May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.

(d) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Issuer or the Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound. (e) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not cause any Securities of such series then listed on any registered national securities exchange under the Exchange Act to be delisted. (f) In the case of an election under Section 9.6, the Issuer or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (who may be counsel to the Issuer or the Guarantor) stating that (x) the Issuer or the Guarantor has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (y) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. (g) In the case of an election under Section 9.7, the Issuer or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject -62-
to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred. (h) Each of the Issuer or the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (who may be counsel to the Issuer or the Guarantor), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the defeasance under Section 9.6 or the covenant defeasance under Section 9.7 (as the case may be) have been complied with. SECTION 9.9 Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.4, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee -- collectively, for purposes of this Section 9.9, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 9.8 in respect of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Issuer acting as its own paying agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Issuer shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 9.8 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series. Anything in this Article Nine to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, from time to time upon the Issuer's or the Guarantor's written request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 9.8 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance. ARTICLE TEN REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES AND SINKING FUNDS SECTION 10.1 Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity and to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.6 for Securities of such series. SECTION 10.2 Notice of Redemption; Selection of Securities. In case the Issuer shall desire to exercise any right to redeem all or any part of the Securities of any series in accordance with their terms, the Issuer shall fix a date for redemption and shall notify the Trustee in writing, at least 45 days before such redemption date if all the Outstanding Securities of a -63-
series are to be redeemed, and at least 60 days before such redemption date if less than all the Outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed. The Issuer, or at the request and at the expense of the Issuer, the Trustee, shall mail a notice of such redemption, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the Holders of Securities of such series so to be redeemed in whole or in part at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Register. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice, to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series. The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the CUSIP number of the Securities of such series, if any, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, if the Securities of such series are convertible at the option of the Holder into shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price, the place or places of conversion, that Securities called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, or on such earlier date, if any, specified pursuant to Section 2.6 for Securities of such series, and if not converted prior to the close of business on such date, the right of conversion will be lost and that Holders who want to convert Securities must satisfy the requirements set forth in the terms thereof, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. If less than all of the Outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall specify the number or numbers or distinguishing symbol or symbols of the Securities to be redeemed. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued. Prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust as required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) an amount of money (in the currency or units of currencies or composite currency in which the Securities so called for redemption are denominated or an appropriate equivalent thereof) sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series or portions thereof so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If less than all the Outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed (or less than the full principal amount of each Security in such series is to be redeemed), the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (or such shorter period if acceptable to the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and, if the Trustee is not acting as the repository of the Register for such series, a current list of all Outstanding Securities of such series. If less than all the Outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such series -64-
to be redeemed in whole or in part; however, if less than all the Securities of any series with differing issue dates, interest rates and stated maturities are to be redeemed, the Issuer in its sole discretion shall select the particular Securities to be redeemed and shall notify the Trustee in writing thereof at least 45 days prior to the relevant redemption date. Except as otherwise specified for Securities of a particular series pursuant to Section 2.6, Securities may be redeemed in part in amounts equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 10.3 Payment of Securities Called for Redemption. If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 10.2, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities or portions thereof at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and, except as provided in Sections 5.4 and 9.4, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture (including, but not limited to, conversion rights pursuant to Article Eleven which shall cease at the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption or on such earlier day, if any, specified pursuant to Section 2.6 for such Securities), and the Holders of such Securities shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided, that if the date fixed for redemption is an interest payment date, the interest due on that date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date according to their terms. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal thereof so to be redeemed shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the Overdue Rate applicable to such series. Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute (in each case with the Guaranty endorsed thereon executed by the Guarantor) and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented. SECTION 10.4 Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for -65-
Redemption. Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number or other distinguishing symbol in a written statement signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to the date on which Securities are to be selected for redemption as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, either (a) the Issuer or the Guarantor or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or the Guarantor. SECTION 10.5 Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date". In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.14, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) that have been surrendered to the Issuer for conversion, or (d) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of Securities of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities, and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a certificate of the Issuer (which need not contain the statements required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) signed by an officer of the Issuer who is one of the officers authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate (a) specifying the portion, if any, of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion, if any, to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series, (b) stating that none of such Securities has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no Event of Default with respect to such series has occurred (which has not been waived or cured) and is continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.14 to the Trustee with such certificate. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any (which cash may be deposited with the Trustee or with one or more paying -66-
agents or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939), on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section. If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed U.S.$100,000 or, if payments on Securities of such series are to be made in a currency other than Dollars or in units or composites of two or more currencies, the equivalent thereof (based upon the Market Exchange Rate on the sixtieth day preceding the relevant sinking fund payment date or if the Market Exchange Rate is not available for such date, the immediately preceding date for which the Market Exchange Rate is available) in the relevant currency or unit or composite currency (or such other amount as is specified for a particular series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.6), or a lesser sum if the Issuer shall so request, with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Issuer if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the next sinking fund payment date following the date of such payment) to the redemption of such Securities at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities for operation of the sinking fund together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be U.S.$100,000 or, if payments on Securities of such series are to be made in a currency other than Dollars or in units or composites of two more currencies, the equivalent thereof (based upon the Market Exchange Rate on the sixtieth day preceding the relevant sinking fund payment date or if the Market Exchange Rate is not available for such date, the immediately preceding date for which the Market Exchange Rate is available) in the relevant currency or unit or composite currency (or such other amount as is specified for the particular series pursuant to Section 2.6), or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of U.S.$100,000, or the equivalent thereof in the relevant currency or unit or composite currency, is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 10.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date, Securities of such series with respect to which cash payment of the applicable sinking fund redemption price will be made and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers or other distinguishing symbols of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. If the Trustee shall be required to select Securities of any series for the sinking fund and is not acting as repository of the Register for such series, at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee a current list of all Outstanding Securities of such series. Securities of any series which are (a) owned by the Issuer, the Guarantor or an entity actually known by the Trustee to be directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or the Guarantor, as shown by the Register, and not known to the Trustee to have been pledged or hypothecated by the Issuer, the Guarantor or any such entity or (b) identified in an -67-
Officers' Certificate at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Issuer, the Guarantor or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or the Guarantor, shall be excluded from Securities of such series eligible for selection for redemption. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so notify the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 10.2, except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund (and with the effect provided in Section 10.3) for the redemption of Securities of such series which, if applicable, is in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or by the Issuer if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent) to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment received by the Trustee (or if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) for such series and, together with such payment (or such amount so segregated), shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.5. Any and all sinking fund monies held by the Trustee (or if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Issuer if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent), together with other monies, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity. On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash (or if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent will segregate and hold in trust as required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund monies or mail any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on such Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph, with respect to such Securities) except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee (or the Issuer if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent) shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Issuer (or the Issuer shall have segregated) a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any monies in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any monies thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article Four and held for the payment of all such Securities. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in case such default or Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 4.9 or the default or Event of Default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund -68-
payment date in any year, such monies shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section 10.5 to the redemption of such Securities. SECTION 10.6 Conversion Arrangement on Call for Redemption. If in connection with any redemption of Securities of any series with respect to which the Holders have the right to convert such Securities into shares of Common Stock, the Holders thereof do not elect to convert such Securities, the Issuer may arrange for the purchase and conversion of such Securities by an agreement with one or more investment banking firms or other purchasers to purchase such Securities by paying to the Trustee in trust for the Holders, not later than the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, an amount not less than the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, of such Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article Ten, the obligation of the Issuer to pay the redemption price of such Securities, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged to the extent such amount is so paid by such purchasers to the Trustee in trust for the Holders. If such an agreement is made, any Securities not duly surrendered for conversion by the Holders thereof may, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to have been acquired by such purchasers from such Holders and (notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Article Eleven) surrendered by such purchasers for conversion, all as of immediately prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, subject to payment by the purchasers as specified above. The Trustee shall hold and dispose of any such amount paid to it in the same manner as it would monies deposited with it by the Issuer for the redemption of Securities. Without the Trustee's prior written consent, no arrangement between the Issuer and such purchasers for the purchase and conversion of any Securities shall increase or otherwise affect any of the powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations of the Trustee as set forth in this Indenture, and the Issuer agrees to indemnify the Trustee from, and hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arising out of or in connection with any such arrangement for the purchase and conversion of any Securities between the Issuer and such purchasers, including the costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee and its counsel in the defense of any claim (whether asserted by the Issuer, the Guarantor, a Holder, or any other Person) or liability arising out of or in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations under this Indenture. ARTICLE ELEVEN CONVERSION OF SECURITIES SECTION 11.1 General. If so provided in the terms of the Securities of any series established in accordance with Section 2.6, the principal amount of the Securities of such series shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock in accordance with this Article Eleven and the terms of such series of Securities if such terms differ from this Article Eleven; provided, however, that if any of the terms by which any such Security shall be convertible into Common Stock are set forth in a supplemental indenture entered into with respect thereto pursuant to Article Seven hereof, the terms of such supplemental indenture shall govern. SECTION 11.2 Right to Convert. Subject to and upon compliance with the pro- -69-
visions of this Article, the Holder of any Security that is convertible into Common Stock shall have the right, at such Holder's option, at any time on or after the date of original issue of such Security or such other date specified in the applicable Resolution delivered pursuant to Section 2.6 and prior to the close of business on the date set forth in such Resolution (or if such Security is called for redemption, then in respect of such Security to and including but not after the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption or on such earlier day, if any, specified pursuant to Section 2.6 for such Security unless the Issuer shall default in the payment due on such date) to convert the principal amount of any such Security of any authorized denomination or, in the case of any Security to be converted of a denomination greater than the minimum denomination for Securities of the applicable series, any portion of such principal which is an authorized denomination or an integral multiple thereof, into that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the principal amount of such Security or portion thereof surrendered for conversion by the Conversion Price therefor by surrender of the Security so to be converted in whole or in part in the manner provided in Section 11.3. Such conversion shall be effected by the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of this Article and the terms of the Securities, if such terms differ from this Article. SECTION 11.3 Manner of Exercise of Conversion Privilege; Delivery of Common Stock; No Adjustment for Interest or Dividends. In order to effect a conversion, the holder of any Security to be converted, in whole or in part, shall surrender such Security to the Trustee or conversion agent at the office or agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose, as provided in Section 3.2 and shall deliver written notice of conversion, which shall be substantially in the Form of Election to Convert as provided for in Section 2.17, to such office or agency. The notice shall be accompanied by payments in respect of transfer taxes, if required pursuant to Section 11.6. Such notice once given, shall be irrevocable and may not be withdrawn. Each Security surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares of Common Stock deliverable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of such Security, be duly endorsed by or be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Issuer, duly executed by the Holder or such Holder's duly authorized attorney, and by any payment required pursuant to this Section 11.3. As promptly as practicable after the surrender of such Security and notice, as aforesaid, the Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered at such office or agency to such Holder, or on such Holder's written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of such Security or portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Article and a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion as provided in Section 11.4. In case any Security of a denomination greater than the minimum denomination for Securities of the applicable series shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Issuer shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Issuer and the Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder, a new Security or Securities of the same series in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Security. Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the date on which such Security shall have been surrendered (accompanied by the funds, if any, required by the last paragraph of this Section) and such notice received by the Issuer, as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be registrable upon such conversion shall become on said date the holder of record of the shares represented -70-
thereby, provided, however, that any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Issuer shall be closed shall constitute the person in whose name the certificates are to be registered as the record holder thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the date upon which such Security shall have been so surrendered. Any Security or portion thereof surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on the record date for any interest payment date to the opening of business on such interest payment date shall (unless such Security or portion thereof being converted shall have been called for redemption or submitted for repayment on a date during such period) be accompanied by payment, in legal tender or other funds acceptable to the Issuer, of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such interest payment date on the principal amount being converted; provided, however, that no such payment need be made if there shall exist at the time of conversion a default in the payment of interest on the applicable series of Securities. An amount equal to such payment shall be paid by the Issuer on such interest payment date to the Holder of such Security on such record date; provided, however, that if the Issuer shall default in the payment of interest on such interest payment date, such amount shall be paid to the Person who made such required payment. Except as provided above in this Section, no adjustment shall be made for interest accrued on any Security converted or for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of such Security as provided in this Article. SECTION 11.4 Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon conversion of Securities. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be deliverable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. Instead of any fraction of a share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon the conversion of any Security, the Issuer shall pay to the Holder of such Security an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward) equal to the same fraction of the closing price (determined in the manner provided in Section 11.5(a)(v)) of the Common Stock on the Trading Day (as defined in Section 11.5(a)(v)) next preceding the date of conversion. SECTION 11.5 Conversion Price Adjustments; Effect of Reclassification, Mergers, Consolidations and Sales of Assets. (a) The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: (i) In case the Issuer shall (x) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (y) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (z) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any Security thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer which such Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such Security been converted immediately prior to the record date in the case of a dividend or the effective date in the case of subdivision or combination. An adjustment made pursuant to this subparagraph (i) shall become effective immediately after the record date -71-
in the case of a dividend, except as provided in subparagraph (vii) below, and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. (ii) In case the Issuer shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of shares of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date mentioned below) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined for purposes of this subparagraph (ii) in subparagraph (v) below), the Conversion Price in effect after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants shall be determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered would purchase at such current market price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock receivable upon exercise of such rights or warrants. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately, except as provided in subparagraph (vii) below, after such record date. (iii) In case the Issuer shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Issuer (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions paid from retained earnings of the Issuer or dividends payable in Common Stock) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those rights or warrants referred to in subparagraph (ii) above) (any of the foregoing being hereinafter in this subparagraph (iii) called the "Assets"), then, in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the current market price per share (as defined for purposes of this subparagraph (iii) in subparagraph (v) below) of the Common Stock at such record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, and the denominator of which shall be the current market price per share (as defined in subparagraph (v) below) of the Common Stock at such record date. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately, except as provided in subparagraph (vii) below, after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. (iv) If, pursuant to subparagraph (ii) or (iii) above, the number of shares of Common Stock into which a Security is convertible shall have been adjusted because the Issuer has declared a dividend, or made a distribution, on the outstanding shares of Common Stock in the form of any right or warrant to purchase securities of the Issuer, or the Issuer has issued any such right or warrant, then, upon the expiration of any such -72-
unexercised right or unexercised warrant, the Conversion Price shall forthwith be adjusted to equal the Conversion Price that would have applied had such right or warrant never been declared, distributed or issued. (v) For the purpose of any computation under subparagraphs (ii) or (iii) above, the current market price per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices of the Common Stock for the shorter of (i) 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last full Trading Day on the exchange or market specified in the second following sentence prior to the Time of Determination or (ii) the period commencing on the date next succeeding the first public announcement of the issuance of such rights or warrants or such distribution through such last full Trading Day prior to the Time of Determination. The term "Time of Determination" as used herein shall be the time and date of the earlier of (x) the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or distributions or (y) the commencement of "ex-dividend" trading in the Common Stock on the exchange or market specified in the following sentence. The closing price for each day shall be the reported last sales price, regular way, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange at such time, on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on the Nasdaq National Market ("NNM") or, if the last sales price or closing bid and asked prices for the Common Stock on each such day shall not have been reported through NNM, the average of the bid and asked prices for such date as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm regularly making a market in the Common Stock selected for such purpose by the Issuer or, if no such quotations are available, the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined by a New York Stock Exchange member firm regularly making a market in the Common Stock selected for such purpose by the Issuer. As used herein, the term "Trading Day" with respect to Common Stock means (x) if the Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange, a day on which the New York Stock Exchange or such other national securities exchange, as the case may be, is open for business or (y) if the Common Stock is quoted on NNM, a day on which trades may be made on NNM or (z) otherwise, any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. (vi) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph (vi) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11.5(a) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest .01 of a share, as the case may be, with one-half cent and .005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. Anything in this Section 11.5(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Issuer shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this Section 11.5(a), as it in its discretion shall -73-
determine to be advisable in order that any stock dividend, subdivision of shares, distribution of rights or warrants to purchase stock or securities, or distribution of other assets (other than cash dividends) hereafter made by the Issuer to its stockholders shall not be taxable. (vii) In any case in which this Section 11.5(a) provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Issuer may defer until the occurrence of such event (x) issuing to the Holder of any Security converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount of cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to Section 11.4. (viii) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided, the Issuer shall file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate, setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment; provided, however, that the failure of the Issuer to file such Officers' Certificate shall not affect the legality or validity of any corporate action by the Issuer. (ix) Whenever the Conversion Price for any series of Securities is adjusted as provided in this Section 11.5(a), the Issuer shall cause to be mailed to each Holder of Securities of such series at its then registered address by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Price setting forth such adjusted Conversion Price and the effective date of such adjusted Conversion Price; provided, however, that the failure of the Issuer to give such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any corporate action by the Issuer. (b) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if any of the following events occur, namely (x) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock), (y) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Issuer with or into another entity as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (z) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any other entity as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then appropriate provision shall be made by supplemental indenture so that (A) the Holder of any outstanding Security that is convertible into Common Stock shall have the right to convert such Security into the kind and amount of the shares of stock and securities or other property or assets (including cash) that would have been receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Security immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance and (B) the number of shares of any such other stock or securities into which such Security shall thereafter be convertible shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the terms of adjustment provided for in this Section, and Sections 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8 and 11.9 shall apply on like terms to any such other stock or securities. (ii) In case of any reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation, merger or combination of the Issuer with or into another entity or entities or of the sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, the Issuer shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder of Securities that are convertible into shares of Common Stock at such Holder's registered address, the date on which such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for stock, securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance. SECTION 11.6 Taxes on Shares Issued. The delivery of stock certificates upon conversion of Securities shall be made without charge to the Holder converting a Security for any tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Issuer shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the delivery of stock registered in any name other than of the Holder of any Security converted, and the Issuer shall not be required to deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the delivery thereof shall have paid to the Issuer the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Issuer that such tax has been paid. SECTION 11.7 Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock. The Issuer covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be delivered upon conversion of Securities of any series which are convertible into Common Stock will upon delivery be fully paid and nonassessable by the Issuer and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. The Issuer covenants that if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any Federal or state law before such shares may be validly delivered upon conversion, the Issuer will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be. The Issuer further covenants that it will, if permitted by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, or such other national stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or if permitted by the rules of the NNM if the Common Stock is approved by it for listing or quotation, list and keep listed for so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or the NNM, upon official notice of issuance, all Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of Securities of any series which are convertible into Common Stock. -75-
SECTION 11.8 Responsibility of Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price applicable to such Securities, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, or whether any such supplemental indenture need be entered into. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent makes any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Issuer to deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion or for any failure of the Issuer to comply with any of the covenants of the Issuer contained in this Article Eleven. SECTION 11.9 Covenant to Reserve Shares. The Issuer covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall then be deliverable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Securities of any series of Securities which are convertible into Common Stock. SECTION 11.10 Other Conversions. If so provided in a Resolution with respect to the Securities of a series, the principal amount of the Securities of such series may be convertible into or exchangeable for other securities of the Issuer (which other securities may be issued under this Indenture or otherwise) or convertible into or exchangeable for securities of another Person, and the issuance of such securities upon any such conversion or exchange shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Resolution. ARTICLE TWELVE GUARANTY OF SECURITIES SECTION 12.1 Guaranty. (a) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees as hereinafter provided to each Holder of a Security of any series authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and to the Trustee, (i) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Security, when and as the same shall become due and payable, subject to any applicable grace period, whether on the date of maturity, by acceleration or upon redemption pursuant to Article Ten or otherwise, according to the terms of such Security and this Indenture and (ii) all other obligations of the Issuer hereunder. (b) The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be as principal obligor and not merely as surety, and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and absolute, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities of any series or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities of any series with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuer, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which -76-
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. (c) The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest, notice with respect to the Security on which the Guaranty is endorsed or the indebtedness evidenced thereby, and all demands whatsoever and covenants that the Guaranty not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations of the Guarantor contained in the Securities and this Indenture. If any Securityholder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer, the Guarantor, any custodian, liquidator, trustee or other similar official acting in relation to the Issuer or the Guarantor, any amount paid by the Issuer or the Guarantor to the Trustee or such Securityholder, the Guaranty to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. (d) The Guarantor agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holders in enforcing any rights under the Guaranty. (e) The Guarantor hereby waives, in favor of the Holders and the Trustee, any and all of its rights, protections, privileges and defenses provided by any applicable law to a guarantor and waives any right of set-off which the Guarantor may have against the Holder of a Security in respect of any amounts which are or may become payable by the Holder of a Security to the Issuer. SECTION 12.2 Representation and Warranty. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that all acts, conditions and things required to be done and performed and to have happened precedent to the creation and issuance of the Guaranty, and to constitute the same legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, have been done and performed and have happened in compliance with all applicable laws. SECTION 12.3 Subrogation. The Guarantor will be subrogated to all rights of Holders of Securities of any series on which the Guaranty is endorsed against the Issuer in respect of any amount paid by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty with respect to Securities of such series; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not, without the consent of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series, be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all of the Securities of such series shall be paid in full or payment thereof shall have been provided for in accordance with this Indenture. ARTICLE THIRTEEN MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SECTION 13.1 Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers and Directors of Issuer Exempt from Individual Liability. No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture, or in any Security, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future -77-
stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or the Guarantor or of any successor, either directly or through the Issuer or the Guarantor or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance of the Securities by the Holders thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. SECTION 13.2 Provisions of Indenture for the Sole Benefit of Parties and Securityholders. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors and assigns and the Holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and of the Holders of the Securities. SECTION 13.3 Successors and Assigns of Issuer and Guarantor Bound by Indenture. All the covenants, stipulations, promises and agreements in this Indenture contained by the Issuer and the Guarantor shall bind each of their successors and assigns, whether or not so expressed. SECTION 13.4 Notices and Demands on Issuer, Guarantor, Trustee and Securityholders. Any notice or demand which by any provision of this Indenture is required or permitted to be given or served by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities to or on the Issuer may be given or served by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail, in a post office letter box (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) addressed (until another address of the Issuer is furnished by the Issuer to the Trustee) to Newmont Mining Corporation, 1700 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado 80203, Attention: Treasurer. Any notice or demand which by any provision of this Indenture is required or permitted to be given or served by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities to or on the Guarantor may be given or served by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail, in a post office letter box (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) addressed (until another address of the Guarantor is furnished by the Guarantor to the Trustee) to Newmont USA Limited, 1700 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado 80203, Attention: Treasurer. Any notice, direction, request or demand by the Issuer, the Guarantor or any Securityholder to or upon the Trustee shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given or made, for all purposes, if given or made in writing and received at its Corporate Trust Office. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Securityholders, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder entitled thereto, at his last address as it appears in the Register. In any case where notice to Securityholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Securityholder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Securityholders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Securityholders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such -78-
waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Indenture as to the giving of notice, any other form of written notice is sufficient, if received. In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Issuer, the Guarantor or Securityholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Indenture as to the giving of notice, any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice. SECTION 13.5 Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained Therein. Upon any application or demand by the Issuer or the Guarantor to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished. Each certificate or opinion provided for in this Indenture and delivered to the Trustee with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (a) a statement that the Person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition, (b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based, (c) a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with and (d) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such Person, such condition or covenant has been complied with. Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or the Guarantor may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters or information which is in the possession of the Issuer or the Guarantor, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer or officers of the Issuer or the Guarantor, unless such counsel knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or the Guarantor or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer or the Guarantor, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or -79-
opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous. Any certificate or opinion of any independent firm of public accountants filed with the Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is independent. SECTION 13.6 Official Acts by Successor Entity. Any act or proceeding by any provision of this Indenture authorized or required to be done or performed by any board, committee or officer of the Issuer or the Guarantor shall and may be done and performed with like force and effect by the like board, committee or officer of any entity that shall at the time be the lawful sole successor of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be. SECTION 13.7 Payments Due on Saturdays, Sundays and Legal Holidays. Except as may be provided pursuant to Section 2.6 with respect to any series of Tranche, if the date of maturity of interest on or principal of the Securities of any series or the date fixed for redemption or repayment of any such Security shall not be a Business Day, then payment of such interest, if any, or principal need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the date fixed for redemption or repayment, and no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such date. SECTION 13.8 NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN. THIS INDENTURE, INCLUDING THE GUARANTY, AND EACH SECURITY AND THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE GUARANTY THEREON, SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, AND FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE. SECTION 13.9 Counterparts. This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. SECTION 13.10 Effect of Headings. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part hereof and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 13.11 Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 that is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provisions shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be. -80-

Reverse of Security NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Issuer (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 22, 2005 (herein called the "Indenture"), among the Issuer, the Guarantor and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $600,000,000. The separate series of Securities may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking or purchase funds (if any), may have different conversion provisions (if any), may be subject to different repayment provisions (if any), may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. The Indenture further provides that the Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking or purchase funds (if any) and may be subject to different repayment provisions (if any). The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, in whole or in part, at the election of the Issuer at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed on the redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below) plus 25 basis points; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the Securities and the Indenture. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 5
Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the securities. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Quotation. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (A) Citigroup Global Capital Markets Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof having the same interest rate and maturity as this Security will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount (calculated as provided in the Indenture) of the Securities of this series then Outstanding may declare the principal of the Securities of this series and accrued interest thereon, if any, to be due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment or supplementing thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount (calculated as 6
provided in the Indenture) of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (all such series voting as a single class). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount (calculated as provided in the Indenture) of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults or Events of Default under the Indenture and the consequences of any such defaults or Events of Default. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest, if any, on this Security at the times, place and rate, if any, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security register, upon due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuer in any place where the principal of and interest, if any, on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, having the same interest rate and maturity and bearing interest from the same date as this Security, of any authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination having the same interest rate and maturity and bearing interest from the same date as such Securities, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon, and none of the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered Holder, shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectually satisfy and discharge liability for monies payable on this Security. 7
No recourse for the payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on this Security, or for payment pursuant to the Guaranty, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer or the Guarantor in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Security, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, official or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Issuer or the Guarantor or of any successor entity, either directly or through the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or any successor entity, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released. All terms used in this Security and not otherwise defined herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. 8
