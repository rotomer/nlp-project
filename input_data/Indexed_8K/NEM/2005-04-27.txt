Exhibit 99.1 NEWMONT ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER NET INCOME OF $84 MILLION ($0.19 PER SHARE) DENVER, April 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced first quarter net income of $84 million ($0.19 per share) compared with net income of $87 million ($0.20 per share) for the first quarter of 2004. First quarter highlights included: * Consolidated gold sales of 2.0 million ounces at consolidated costs applicable to sales of $239 per ounce; * Net cash provided by operating activities of $188 million after a working capital increase of $78 million; and * Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of $2.2 billion. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "As we are seeing throughout the industry, rising input commodity prices adversely impacted operating costs during the quarter. Production was also temporarily impacted by geotechnical factors at Batu Hijau. Consistent with prior guidance, we anticipate significantly stronger operating performance in the second half of the year as we start to benefit from new stripping capacity and higher grades. Our project development efforts are ahead of schedule, and we continue to see positive exploration results at Phoenix, Minas Conga and Ahafo." Financial (in millions, except per share) Q1 2005 Q1 2004 --------------------------------------------- ---------- ---------- Revenues $ 961 $ 1,122 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 188 $ 353 Net income $ 84 $ 87 Net income per common share $ 0.19 $ 0.20 Operating Consolidated gold sales (000 ounces) (1) 1,994 2,283 Equity gold sales (000 ounces) (2) 1,551 1,812 Average realized price ($/ounce) $ 425 $ 412 Costs applicable to sales ($/ounce) (1) $ 239 $ 219 Total cash costs ($/equity ounce) (3) $ 257 $ 230 Total production costs ($/equity ounce) (3) $ 325 $ 297 (1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2005, Newmont is reporting consolidated sales and consolidated costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold and per pound of copper in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Costs applicable to sales exclude depreciation, depletion and amortization, which are shown separately. Please refer to the table on page 12 of this release for a comparison of total cash costs per ounce and costs applicable to sales per ounce and equity gold sales and consolidated gold sales. Newmont will discontinue providing guidance for equity sales and total cash costs beginning in the second quarter of 2005.
(2) Excludes 8.8 thousand ounces and 0.2 thousand ounces from Golden Grove in 2005 and 2004, respectively. (3) For a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce of gold and per pound of copper and total production costs per ounce of gold and per pound of copper (non-GAAP measures of performance) to costs applicable to sales calculated under GAAP, please refer to the reconciliation tables on pages 17 through 22 of this release. FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW First quarter 2005 net income was $84 million ($0.19 per share), compared with $87 million ($0.20 per share) for the first quarter of 2004. Net income for the first quarter was impacted by the following items: * a $20 million ($0.04 per share) gain on the sale of the Mezcala property in Mexico; * a $19 million ($0.04 per share) net tax benefit from changes in Australian tax law; * a $5 million ($0.01 per share) expense for litigation and related costs at Minahasa in Indonesia; and * a $4 million ($0.01 per share) expense relating to waste dump remediation costs in Nevada. These items had the net effect of increasing net income for the first quarter of 2005 by $30 million ($0.07 per share). Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was impacted by a $47 million ($0.10 per share) non-cash, after-tax charge to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to conform accounting policies upon consolidation of Batu Hijau. For the first quarter of 2005, the Company sold 1,994,000 ounces of gold on a consolidated basis at an average realized price of $425 per ounce. For the first quarter of 2004, the Company's consolidated gold sales were 2,283,000 ounces at an average realized price of $412 per ounce. The Company generated net cash from operating activities of $188 million in the first quarter of 2005 after a $78 million increase in working capital, compared with $353 million in the year ago quarter. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - NORTH AMERICA
In Nevada, gold sales decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 9% decline in mill grade in 2005 and sales from inventories in 2004, partially offset by a 14% increase in mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 5% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased diesel prices, higher underground contracted services and equipment maintenance costs and reduced production. At Golden Giant in Canada, gold sales decreased 15,000 ounces in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 22% decline in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of lower production. Golden Giant is nearing the end of its mine life with final sales expected in early 2006. At Holloway in Canada, gold sales increased by 4% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 10% increase in mill throughput, partially offset by a 7% decline in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 47% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased mill maintenance costs at the recently acquired Holt McDermott mill. At La Herradura in Mexico, gold sales increased 9% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 28% increase in grade. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - SOUTH AMERICA At Yanacocha in Peru, gold sales decreased 3% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004 due to lower production resulting from a 6% decrease in tons placed on the leach pads. The decrease in tons placed was partially offset by a 36% increase in the grade of ore placed. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 2% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004 primarily due to increased labor costs and commodity prices. At Kori Kollo in Bolivia, mining was completed and the mill was closed in October 2003, with production continuing from residual leaching. Kori Kollo will begin processing oxide ores on leach pads from the Kori Chaca satellite pit and reprocessing high-grade tailings on a new leach pad in the second quarter of 2005.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND At Pajingo, gold sales decreased 42% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 25% decline in ore grade attributable to excess dilution due to poor ground conditions. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 78% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower production and additional underground rehabilitation work. At Yandal, gold sales decreased 38% in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to the sale of the Bronzewing mine in 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 44% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to higher underground development costs at Jundee. At Tanami, gold sales decreased 20% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 20% decline in ore grade from processing lower grade stockpiles at Groundrush and mining lower grades at the Callie underground deposit. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower production. At Kalgoorlie, gold sales decreased 4% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to higher sales from inventories in 2004 that were partially offset by increased production in 2005 as a result of a 14% increase in mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased consumption of reagents and grinding media as a result of increased throughput. At Golden Grove, less zinc concentrate and no copper concentrate were sold during the first quarter of 2005 due to mine plan sequencing and the timing of shipments. Costs applicable to sales per pound of zinc decreased 53% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting higher by-product gold shipments in the first quarter of 2005. At Martha in New Zealand, gold sales increased 95% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 123% increase in ore grade as a result of mining higher grades in the open pit. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 35% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased production, partially offset by higher processing costs from milling harder ore. Martha is experiencing ground stability issues in a portion of the south wall of the open pit which might impact the ability to mine a portion of reserves remaining in the pit.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - INDONESIA At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper and gold sales decreased 24% and 25%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004. Access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was temporarily restricted as a result of pit wall sloughing and associated clean-up during the quarter. The mine plan sequence was revised resulting in the processing of lower grade stockpiles, some of which were scheduled to be processed later in 2005. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased 45% and 66%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004 due to lower production, increased maintenance costs and higher lime consumption. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - CENTRAL ASIA At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, gold sales decreased 39% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to 16% fewer tons placed on the leach pads, from unscheduled plant downtime, and a 28% decrease in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 33% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the decrease in production. The Ovacik mine in Turkey was sold to a subsidiary of a Turkish group on March 1, 2005. Operations were suspended in August 2004.
CASH, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND DEBT At the end of the first quarter, cash, short-term marketable securities and other short-term investments totaled $2.2 billion, essentially offsetting outstanding debt of $2.2 billion. Of the outstanding debt, $706 million was Batu Hijau project finance debt that is non-recourse to Newmont. During the first quarter, outstanding debt increased by a net $580 million. During March 2005, the Company issued uncollateralized notes with a principal amount of $600 million due April 2035 bearing an interest rate of 5 7/8%. The proceeds will be used to fund capital investments, possibly including a 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada, and for general corporate purposes. MERCHANT BANKING Newmont Capital manages the Company's royalty and marketable securities portfolios as well as supporting asset transactions. For the first quarter of 2005, royalty and dividend income was $18 million, up 38% from the year ago quarter. At the end of the first quarter of 2005, the market value of the marketable equity securities portfolio managed by Newmont Capital was $606 million, an increase of $101 million over 2004 year-end. During the first quarter of 2005, Newmont Capital managed the following transactions and agreements: * closed the sale of the Ovacik mine in Turkey; * closed the sale of the Mezcala property in Mexico; * completed the purchase of a 9.9% interest in Shore Gold; and * completed phase 2 drilling on the Alberta heavy oil leases. CAPITAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE The Leeville underground project in Nevada remains on schedule for initial gold production in the fourth quarter of 2005. The production shaft is 92% complete, at a depth of 1,673 feet. Hoisting from the nearly completed ventilation shaft is expected to begin by the third quarter. Overall, construction is 64% complete. Also in Nevada, at the Phoenix project, engineering is 97% complete and construction is 25% complete. Initial gold production is expected by early 2006 as compared to prior guidance of mid-2006. Construction of a proposed 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada is awaiting permits and final approvals. When completed, the coal-fired plant is expected to reduce costs applicable to sales by up to $20 per ounce in Nevada. At the Ahafo project in Ghana, engineering is approximately 90% complete and construction is 30% complete. Construction of the mill foundations, the water storage dam and the tailings storage facility is progressing. Orders have been placed for electricity sub stations, power lines and transformers. The project remains on schedule for initial gold production in the second half of 2006. At Akyem in Ghana, the feasibility study update was recently completed with a development decision expected by mid-2005.
At Boddington in Australia, work continues on the feasibility study update with a development decision possible in 2006. EXPLORATION, ADVANCED PROJECTS, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Exploration expenditures were $27 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $21 million in the year ago quarter. Advanced projects, research and development expenditures were $18 million in the first quarter of 2005 as compared with $16 million in the first quarter of 2004. In Nevada, positive results from drilling at the Phoenix project and from a down dip high-grade extension of Gold Quarry will be further pursued this year. In the southern region of Ahafo in Ghana, development drilling completed in April identified mineralization 450 feet below the current $375-gold pit shell. At the Minas Conga district in Peru, infill drilling at the Perol and Chailhuagon deposits is intended to convert non-reserve mineralization to reserves in 2005, and follow-up delineation drilling is planned for the satellite Amaro target. 2005 GUIDANCE The Company expects consolidated gold sales in the range of 8.5 - 8.7 million ounces at consolidated costs applicable to sales of $225 - $235 per ounce in 2005. For 2005, Newmont expects equity gold sales in the range of 6.6 - 6.8 million ounces, essentially unchanged from previous guidance, at total cash costs of $240 - $250 per ounce, slightly higher than prior guidance. In addition, the Company expects consolidated copper sales of 695 million pounds at consolidated costs applicable to sales of $0.48 per pound and equity copper sales of 395 million pounds at total cash costs of $0.77 per pound in 2005. Newmont will discontinue providing guidance for equity sales and total cash costs beginning in the second quarter of 2005. The Company reiterated that gold sales will be weighted to the second half of the year as new stripping capacity is put into service, generally higher grades are accessed, and Leeville begins production. In a change from the prior practice of reporting exploration, research and development as a single line item in the income statement, Newmont is now reporting exploration separately from advanced projects, research and development for greater transparency. For 2005, exploration expenditures are expected in the range of $150-$160 million, while advanced projects, research and development expenditures are estimated in the range of $60-$70 million. Exploration expenditures remain in line with prior guidance while efforts will be focused in Ghana, Peru and Nevada. Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be $1.00 - $1.25 billion. For site by site details, please refer to the supplemental capital expenditures, depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration worksheet provided with the news release on the Newmont web site, under Investor Information/News Releases.

GOLD PRODUCTION - OTHER
BASE METAL SUMMARY - BATU HIJAU AND GOLDEN GROVE (1) Total cash cost per pound for base metals includes smelting and refining costs. Smelting and refining costs are deducted from revenue in the Company's financial statements and are therefore not included in costs applicable to sales.
RECONCILIATION OF COSTS APPLICABLE TO TOTAL CASH COSTS PER OUNCE AND PER POUND, AND TOTAL PRODUCTION COSTS PER OUNCE AND PER POUND (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER OUNCE AMOUNTS) The total cash costs and total production costs per ounce or pound are non-GAAP performance measures that are intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities and profitability of Newmont's mining operations. Newmont's management uses these measures for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its mining operations. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures were developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont's measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.

Notes: (1) For more detailed descriptions, definitions and explanations, refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 filed on March 15, 2005. (2) Prices quoted are gross contract prices, which represent the gross cash flow per ounce of each contract. Not included in these prices are the additional cash outflows associated with borrowing gold over the life of the contract where the contracts are floating in nature. The rate at which gold is borrowed is determined over the life of the contract based on the prevailing market gold lease rate for the time period that the borrowing is fixed. The borrowing can be fixed for varying periods over the life of the contract.
(3) In addition to the gold hedge positions shown in the table above, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales contract in July 1999, which is reflected as debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Under the prepaid forward gold sales contract, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces of gold.
