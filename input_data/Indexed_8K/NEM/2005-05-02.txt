Item 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On April 27, 2005, the stockholders of Newmont Mining Corporation (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors, approved the Newmont Mining Corporation 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan").
 
The purpose of the 2005 Plan is to enhance the growth, development and success of the Company for the benefit of its stockholders by enabling the Company to offer employees, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and eligible affiliates common stock-based incentives and thereby attract, retain and reward these individuals and strengthen the mutuality of interests between these individuals and the Company's stockholders. The Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee"), which administers the 2005 Plan, will determine which eligible employees, non-employee directors and/or consultants will receive options or other awards under 2005 Plan and the type and number of shares of common stock covered by each option or other award under the Plan. A maximum of 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock are available for delivery under the 2005 Plan, subject to adjustment for certain changes in the Company's capital structure. Out of this maximum number of shares of common stock, no more than 10,000,000 shares may be awarded as restricted stock or other stock-based awards and no more than 1,000,000 shares may be awarded as non-employee director stock awards.
 
A more detailed summary of the material features of the 2005 Plan is set forth in the Company's proxy statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2005 (the "2005 Proxy Statement"). The summary in the 2005 Proxy Statement and the description of the 2005 Plan contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2005 Plan, which is included as part of the 2005 Proxy Statement and filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
On April 27, 2005, the Board of Directors decided not to grant to the non-employee directors who were elected or re-elected to the Company's Board of Directors at the Company's 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders the stock awards described in the 2005 Proxy Statement under "Directors Compensation - Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan" on the first business day after such Annual Meeting. Instead, such directors will receive under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan an equity-based award having a fair market value of $50,000 on the date of grant, in such form and subject to such terms as determined by the Board of Directors.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Committee may determine in its discretion that an Option may be exercised following termination of such continuous employment or service as a director or consultant, whether or not exercisable at the time of such termination, to the extent provided in the applicable Agreement; , , that in no event may any such Option be exercised after ten (10) years from the date it was originally granted, except as otherwise provided in Section 6(c).

(g) (i) Each Agreement relating to an Option shall state whether such Option will or will not be treated as an ISO. No ISO shall be granted unless such Option, when granted, qualifies as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. No ISO shall be granted to any individual otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan who is not an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary on the date of granting of such Option. Any ISO granted under the Plan shall contain such terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, as the Committee may determine to be necessary to qualify such Option as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. Any ISO granted under the Plan may be modified by the Committee to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code.
 
(ii) Notwithstanding any intent to grant ISOs, an Option granted under the Plan will not be considered an ISO to the extent that it, together with any other "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to subsection (d) of such Section) under the Plan or any other incentive stock option plans of the Company, any Subsidiary and any "parent corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(e) of the Code, are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year with respect to Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 (or such other maximum limit as may be required by the Code) as of the time the Option with respect to such Common Stock is granted. The rule set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted and in conformance with Section 422(d) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
(iii) No ISO shall be granted to an employee otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan who owns (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code), at the time the Option is granted, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or a Subsidiary, or any "parent corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(e) of the Code. This restriction does not apply if at the time such ISO is granted the option exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to the Option is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date such ISO is granted, and the ISO by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from such date of grant.
 
(h) The Committee may require an Optionee to give prompt Notice to the Company concerning any disposition of shares of Common Stock received upon the exercise of an ISO within: (i) two (2) years from the date of granting of such ISO to such Optionee, (ii) one (1) year from the transfer of such shares of Common Stock to such Optionee or (iii) such other period as the Committee may from time to time determine. The Committee may direct that an Optionee with respect to an ISO undertake in the applicable Agreement to give such Notice described in the preceding sentence, at such time and containing such information as the Committee may prescribe, and/or that the certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an ISO refer to such requirement to give such Notice.
 
(i) The Committee may provide, in its discretion, at the time of grant of an Option, that the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such Option's exercise shall be in the form of Restricted Stock or similar other securities, or may reserve the right to so provide after the time of such grant.
 
(j) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options, or accept the surrender of outstanding Options (up to the extent not theretofore exercised) and authorize the granting of new Options or other Awards in substitution therefor (to the extent not theretofore exercised).
 
(ii) In the event the Company no longer uses Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 to account for equity compensation and is required to or elects to expense the cost of Options pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (or a successor or similar standard), the Committee shall have the authority to substitute, without receiving Participant consent, SARs (payable in Common Stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the Committee's discretion) for then outstanding Options; that the terms of such substituted SARs correspond in relevant respects to the terms of related Options and the difference between the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares of Common Stock and the grant price (as defined in Section 7) of such substituted SAR is equivalent to the difference between the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares of Common Stock and the option exercise price of such related Option, as determined by the Committee.

7. Each SAR shall be subject to all the applicable provisions of the Plan, including the following terms and conditions, and to such other terms and conditions not inconsistent therewith as the Committee shall determine and which are set forth in the applicable Agreement.

Terms and Conditions of SARs
 
(a) The Committee may grant a SAR (i)(A) in conjunction and simultaneously with all or part of the grant of an Option, or (B) with respect to all or part of a previously-granted Option that is not an ISO (a ""), or (ii) independent of, and unrelated to, an Option (an "").
Tandem SAR
Independent SAR
 
(b) The number of shares of Common Stock to which a SAR pertains shall be determined by the Committee and stated in the Agreement evidencing such SAR.
 
(c) The grant price for each SAR shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement. The grant price of a Tandem SAR shall be equal to option exercise price of the related Option. The grant price of an Independent SAR may be fixed or indexed and shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date such SAR is granted, except in the case of Substitute Awards or Awards granted in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 16 or as otherwise provided in Section 6(j)(ii).
 
(d) (i) A Tandem SAR may be exercised for all or part of the shares of Common Stock subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent the related Option is exercisable and may be exercised only with respect to the shares of Common Stock for which the related Option is then exercisable. A Tandem SAR shall terminate and shall no longer be exercisable upon the expiration or exercise of the related Option, except that a Tandem SAR granted with respect to less than the full number of shares of Common Stock covered by the related Option shall not be reduced until the exercise or termination of the related Option exceeds the number of shares not covered by the SAR. A Tandem SAR shall entitle a Participant to elect, in the manner described below and as set forth in the applicable Agreement, in lieu of exercising his or her related Option, for all or a portion of the shares of Common Stock for which such Option is then exercisable pursuant to its terms, to surrender such Option with respect to any or all of such shares and to receive from the Company in exchange therefor a payment described in this Section 7. An Option with respect to which a Participant has elected to exercise a Tandem SAR shall, to the extent of the shares covered by such exercise, be automatically cancelled and surrendered to the Company. Such Option shall thereafter remain exercisable according to its terms only with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock as to which it would otherwise be exercisable, less the number of such shares with respect to which such Tandem SAR has been so exercised. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO: (A) the Tandem SAR may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the shares subject to the ISO exceeds the option exercise price of the ISO, and (B) the value of the payment with respect to the Tandem SAR may not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between the Fair Market Value of the shares for which the Tandem SAR is exercised at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised and the option exercise price of the ISO.
 
(ii) An Independent SAR may be exercised upon whatever terms and conditions the Committee, in its discretion, in accordance with the Plan, determines and sets forth in the Agreement; , , that no SAR (unless it is a Substitute Award) may (i) become exercisable until the expiration of a period of at least six (6) months after the grant date of such SAR or (ii) become exercisable in full prior to two (2) years from the grant date of such SAR, except in the event of the Participant's death, disability or retirement or a Change of Control, or, with respect to clause (ii) immediately preceding, other circumstances specified by the Committee.

(iii) The Agreement evidencing a SAR shall set forth the extent, if any, to which the Participant may exercise such SAR following termination of the Participant's service as an employee, director or consultant with the Company or an Affiliate, subject to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section 7(d).
 
(iv) No SAR shall be exercisable more than ten (10) years after it is granted, subject to the last sentence of Section 6(c) in the case of a Tandem SAR.
 
(e) An election to exercise SARs shall be deemed to have been made on the date of Notice of such election to the Company.
 
(f) Upon exercise of a SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company with a value equal to the amount by which (i) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of such exercise, multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the SAR is so exercised, exceeds (ii) the grant price of the SAR, multiplied by such number of shares; , , that the Committee may establish, and set forth in the Agreement, a maximum amount per share of Common Stock that will be payable upon the exercise of a SAR; , , that the Agreement may provide that payment of such exercised SAR shall be made on a date or dates set forth in such Agreement following such exercise, and prior to such payment, the right to receive such payment shall be governed by Section 17(e)(ii).

The number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be stated, or determined by reference to a formula contained, in the Agreement.
 
(b) During the Restriction Period stated in the Agreement, (i) the Participant who receives shares of Restricted Stock shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of such shares, and any attempt by such Participant to do so shall constitute the immediate and automatic forfeiture of such Award, and (ii) the shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to such other restrictions as the Committee may impose, including any restriction described in paragraph (c) of this Section 8 or any restriction on the right to vote, and the right to receive or retain dividends on, such shares.

16. (a) The existence of the Plan and any Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company or an Affiliate, any issue of debt, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting Common Stock, the authorization or issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or subscription rights thereto, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Affiliates, any sale or transfer of all or part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding.

Changes in Capital
 
(b) (i) Upon changes in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation (whether or not the Company is a surviving corporation), combination or exchange of shares of Common Stock, separation, or reorganization, or in the event of an extraordinary dividend, "spin-off," liquidation or other substantial distribution of assets of the Company or acquisition of property or stock or other change in capital of the Company, or the issuance by the Company of shares of its capital stock without receipt of full consideration therefor, or rights or securities exercisable, convertible or exchangeable for shares of such capital stock, or any similar change affecting the Company's capital structure, such adjustments and other substitutions shall be made to the Plan and to Awards as the Committee in its discretion deems equitable or appropriate, including such adjustments in (1) the aggregate number, class and kind of securities available under the Plan and as to which Awards may be granted, (2) the Award limits set forth in Section 15(e) and (3) in the number, class and kind of securities or other property subject to Awards and, if applicable, the option exercise price, grant price or other price per share (or equivalent) thereof (including, if the Committee deems appropriate, the substitution of similar
 
options to purchase the shares of, or other awards denominated in the shares of, another company, or the cancellation of outstanding Awards in exchange for payments of cash, property or a combination thereof), as the Committee in its discretion may determine to be appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to outstanding Awards.
 
(ii) Fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from any adjustment in Awards pursuant to this Section 16(b) shall be aggregated until, and eliminated at, the time of exercise or payment of the affected Awards or at the end of the Restriction Period with respect to Restricted Stock. Notice of any adjustment shall be given by the Committee to each Participant whose Award has been adjusted and such adjustment (whether or not such Notice is given) shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
 
(iii) Any adjustment, substitution or change pursuant to this Section 16 made with respect to an Award intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be made only to the extent consistent with such intent, unless the Committee determines otherwise, and any such adjustment that is made with respect to an Award to which Section 15 is applicable shall be made consistent with the intent that such Award qualify for the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor provision).
 
(iv) Determinations of the Committee as to Award adjustments and substitutions under this Section 16, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons, including Participants.
 
(c) In the event of a Change of Control:
 
(i) except as otherwise provided in the Agreement specifically with respect to a Change of Control:
 
(1) immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, all restrictions on Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards previously awarded to Participants shall be immediately cancelled, the Restriction Periods applicable to such Restricted Stock shall immediately terminate and all restrictions on transfer, sale, assignment, pledge or other disposition applicable to any such Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards shall immediately lapse, without regard to any contrary provisions contained in the Plan or the applicable Agreements;
 
(2) immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, all Options, SARs and/or Other Stock-Based Awards which are outstanding shall be accelerated so that such Awards immediately become fully exercisable as to all shares of Common Stock subject thereto, without regard to any limitations of time or amount otherwise contained in the Plan or the applicable Agreements or any other provision of the Plan or the applicable Agreements to the contrary, and, in the event a Participant terminates employment
 
or service with the Company or an Affiliate (or any successor respectively thereof) under any circumstances during the one year period following a Change of Control, all Options or SARs held by such Participant (or such Participant's transferee) shall remain exercisable at least until the first anniversary of the Participant's termination of employment or service or the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR, if earlier;
 
(3) immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, all restrictions on transfer, sale, assignment, pledge or other disposition applicable to any shares of Common Stock covered by a Non-employee Director Stock Award shall immediately lapse;
 
(4) immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, all outstanding Awards shall immediately become fully vested and nonforfeitable;
 
(5) any performance goals or other conditions applicable to any outstanding Award shall be deemed achieved and satisfied at the highest level, without regard to any contrary provisions contained in the Plan or the applicable Agreement; and
 
(6) except as otherwise provided by the Committee in accordance with Section 16(c)(ii), any Award the payment or settlement of which was deferred under Section 17(e)(ii), and any Other Stock-Based Award that is otherwise to be paid or settled on a deferred basis, shall be paid or distributed immediately prior to such Change of Control; and
 
(ii) in its discretion and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Agreement applicable to any Award or by a resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, that:
 
(1) any outstanding Award shall be adjusted by substituting for each share of Common Stock subject to such Award immediately prior to the transaction resulting in the Change of Control the consideration (whether stock or other securities of the surviving corporation or any successor corporation of the Company, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or that may be issuable by another corporation that is a party to the transaction resulting in the Change of Control, or other property) received in such transaction by holders of Common Stock for each share of such Common Stock held on the closing or effective date of such transaction, in which event, the aggregate exercise price or grant price (if any) of the Award shall remain the same; , , that if such consideration received in such transaction is not solely stock of a successor, surviving or other corporation, the Committee may provide for the consideration to be received upon exercise or payment of an Award, for each share of Common Stock subject to such Award, to be solely stock or other securities of the successor, surviving or other corporation, as applicable, equal in fair market value, as determined by the Committee, to the per-share consideration received by holders of the Common Stock in such transaction; and
provided
however
 
(2) any outstanding Award (or a portion thereof) shall be converted into a right to receive in cash, as soon as practicable following the Change of Control, an amount equal to the greater of (x) the highest value of the consideration to be received in connection with such transaction for one share of Common Stock and (y) the highest market trading price of a share of the Common Stock reported in during the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the Change of Control, less, in the case of an Award prescribing an exercise price or grant price, the per share exercise price or grant price of such Award, multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award (or the applicable portion thereof); and

(iii) the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that an Award cannot be exercised after, or will otherwise terminate as of, such Change of Control.
 
No Participant shall have any right to prevent the consummation of any transaction involving the Company or an Affiliate or any of the forgoing actions affecting the number of shares available to, or other entitlements of, such Participant under the Plan or any Award. Any actions or determinations of the Committee under this paragraph (c) of Section 16 need not be uniform as to all outstanding Awards, nor treat all Participants identically. Notwithstanding the foregoing adjustments, in no event may any Option or SAR be exercised after ten (10) years from the date it was originally granted, except as otherwise provided in Section 6(c).
 
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Agreement, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this Section 16 may not be terminated, amended or modified on or after the date of a Change of Control to adversely affect any Participant's Award theretofore granted and then outstanding under the Plan without the prior written consent of such Participant.
 
17. (a) The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the issuance of shares or the payment of cash upon exercise or payment of any Award. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Options granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company. The costs and expenses of the Plan shall be borne by the Company, including expenses of issuing Common Stock pursuant to any Awards granted hereunder.

Miscellaneous Provisions
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) of Section 17 or paragraph (e) of Section 8 or paragraph (d) of Section 10, an Award by its terms shall be personal and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, encumbered or otherwise alienated or hypothecated otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of a Participant only by him or her. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, at the Committee's discretion, an Agreement may permit the receipt or exercise of a Participant's Award (or any portion thereof) after his or her death by the beneficiary most recently named by such Participant in a written designation thereof filed with the Company, or, in lieu of any such surviving beneficiary, by the legal representatives of such Participant's estate and/or an Award
 
other than an ISO to be transferred by a Participant during his or her lifetime to such Participant's alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or the rules and regulations thereunder. Further notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, at the Committee's discretion, an Agreement may permit the transfer of an Award, other than an ISO or a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO, by the recipient thereof, subject to (i) any applicable Restriction Period, (ii) the provisions of Section 10(d), if applicable, and (iii) such other terms, conditions and limitations as may be prescribed by the Committee (including a requirement that the transferee execute an agreement agreeing to be bound by the terms of such Award or any such other terms, conditions and limitations), and, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, the applicable transferee of such Award shall be treated under the Plan and the applicable Agreement as the Participant for purposes of any exercise or payment of such Award. In the event any Award is exercised by or otherwise paid to the executors, administrators, heirs or distributees of the estate of a deceased Participant, or such a Participant's beneficiary, or the transferee of an Award, in any such case, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Agreement and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time by the Committee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue Common Stock thereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied, as determined in the discretion of the Committee, that the person or persons exercising such Award, or to receive such payment, are the duly appointed legal representative of the deceased Participant's estate or the proper legatees or distributees thereof or the named beneficiary of such Participant, or the valid transferee of such Award, as applicable. Any purported assignment, transfer or encumbrance of an Award that does not comply with this Section 17(b) shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.
 
(c) (i) If at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration and/or qualification of shares of Common Stock upon any securities exchange or under any state or Federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of shares of Common Stock hereunder, no Award may be granted, exercised, paid or transferred in whole or in part unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent and/or approval shall have been effected or obtained, or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
 
(ii) If at any time counsel to the Company shall be of the opinion that any sale or delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award is or may be in the circumstances unlawful or result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company or any Affiliate under the statutes, rules or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, the Company shall have no obligation to make such sale or delivery, or to make any application or to effect or to maintain any qualification or registration under the Securities Act, or otherwise with respect to shares of Stock or Awards and the right to exercise any Option or other Award shall be suspended until, in the opinion of such counsel, such sale or delivery shall be lawful or will not result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company or any Affiliate.
 
(iii) Upon termination of any period of suspension under this Section 17(c), any Award affected by such suspension which shall not then have expired or terminated
 
shall be reinstated as to all shares available before such suspension and as to the shares which would otherwise have become available during the period of such suspension, but no suspension shall extend the term of any Award.
 
(d) The Committee may require each person receiving Common Stock in connection with any Award under the Plan to represent and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the shares of Common Stock for investment without a view to the distribution thereof, and/or provide such other representations and agreements as the Committee may prescribe.
 
(e) (i) The Committee may impose such restrictions on any shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option or delivered pursuant to the payment or settlement of any other Award as it may deem advisable, including minimum holding period requirements, restrictions under applicable securities laws or under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such shares are listed and/or traded.
 
(ii) To the extent provided in the Agreement, the Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer such Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR, the lapse or waiver of the Restriction Period with respect to Restricted Stock or the payment in respect of Other Stock-Based Awards. If any such deferral is permitted or required, (x) such deferral shall represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company and shall not confer the rights of a stockholder unless and until shares of Common Stock are issued thereunder; (y) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such deferral shall, until settlement thereof, be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 16; and (z) the Committee shall establish rules and procedures for such deferrals and payment or settlement thereof, which may be in cash, shares of Common Stock or any combination thereof, and such deferrals may be governed by the terms and conditions of any deferred compensation plan of the Company or an Affiliate specified by the Committee for such purpose.
 
(f) (i) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment shall be made in the shares of Common Stock issuable under Awards on account of cash dividends that may be paid or other rights that may be issued to the holders of Common Stock prior to issuance of such shares under such Award.
 
(ii) Any Award (including any Award the payment or settlement of which is deferred pursuant to Section 17(e)(ii)) may accrue Dividend Equivalents during any period following the date such Award is granted and until the date such Award is exercised, vests, terminates or expires, as determined by the Committee. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional shares of Common Stock, on a current or deferred basis (and may thereafter accrue additional Dividend Equivalents), by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Committee.
 
(g) By accepting any benefit under the Plan, each Participant and each person claiming under or through such Participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated their acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and any action taken under the Plan by the Committee, the Company or the Board.
 
(h) Neither the adoption of the Plan nor anything contained herein shall affect any other compensation or incentive plans or arrangements of the Company or any Affiliate, or prevent or limit the right of the Company or any Affiliate to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for their employees or consultants or directors, or grant or assume options or other rights otherwise than under the Plan.
 
(i) Unless stated otherwise in the Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award granted to an executive, officer or director of the Company who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule 16b-3) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule, and the Plan and the Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such limitations. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or an Agreement, any Award subject to Section 15 shall be subject to any applicable limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder (including any amendment to the foregoing) that are requirements for qualification as "other performance-based compensation" as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and the Plan and the Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements and no action of the Committee that would cause such Award not to so qualify shall be effective.
 
(j) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall have the authority to determine (and may so provide in any Agreement) that a Participant's (including, for purposes of this Section 17(j), his or her estate's or beneficiary's) rights (including the right to exercise any Option or SAR), payments and benefits with respect to any Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment in the event of the Participant's termination of employment or service with the Company or an Affiliate for cause or due to voluntary resignation; serious misconduct; violation of the Company's or an Affiliate's policies; breach of fiduciary duty; unauthorized disclosure of any trade secret or confidential information of the Company or an Affiliate; breach of applicable noncompetition, nonsolicitation, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants; or other conduct or activity that is in competition with the business of the Company or any Affiliate, or otherwise detrimental to the business, reputation or interests of the Company and/or any Affiliate (in any such case, whether or not the Participant is then an employee, director or consultant of the Company or an Affiliate). The determination of whether a Participant's conduct, activities or circumstances are described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be made by the Committee in its good faith discretion, and pending any such determination, the Committee shall have the authority to suspend the exercise, payment, delivery or settlement of all or any portion of such Participant's outstanding Awards pending an investigation of the matter.
 
(k) Except to the extent that such action would cause an Award subject to Section 15 to not qualify for the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor provision), the Committee shall have the authority to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements or changes in applicable laws, regulations, rules or
 
accounting principles. The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award, including any Agreement, in the manner and to the extent the Committee shall deem desirable to effectuate any such adjustments. The determination of the Committee concerning the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on all Participants.
 
(l) An Option or other Award shall not be exercisable with respect to a fractional share of Common Stock or the lesser of fifty (50) shares or the full number of shares of Common Stock then subject to the Option or other Award. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the exercise or payment of an Option or other Award.
 
(m) In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
 
(n) Except as to matters concerning the issuance of shares of Common Stock or other matters of corporate governance, which shall be determined, and related Plan and Award provisions construed, under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Plan and each Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, Participants are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Colorado, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to the Plan or any related Agreement.
 
(o) The words "Section," "subsection" and "paragraph" herein shall refer to provisions of the Plan, unless expressly indicated otherwise. Wherever any words are used in the Plan or any Agreement in the masculine gender they shall be construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in all cases where they would so apply, and wherever any words are used herein in the singular form they shall be construed as though they were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply. The words "include," "includes," and "including" herein shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation" whether or not they are in fact followed by such words or words of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
18. (a) Any liability of the Company or an Affiliate to any Participant with respect to any Award shall be based solely upon contractual obligations created by the Plan and the Agreement.
.
Limits of Liability
 
(b) None of the Company, any Affiliate nor any member of the Committee or the Board, nor any other person participating in any determination of any question under the Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of the Plan, shall have any liability, in the absence of bad faith, to any party for any action taken or not taken in connection with the Plan, except as may expressly be provided by statute.
 
(c) The Company shall not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance of shares of Common Stock as to which the Company has been unable to obtain
 
from any regulatory body having relevant jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Committee or the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Common Stock hereunder, and (ii) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Option or other Award.
 
19. The Board may, at any time and with or without prior notice, amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan, and the Committee may, to the extent permitted by the Plan, amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, including any Agreement, in each case, retroactively or prospectively; that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall be made which, without first obtaining approval of the stockholders of the Company (where such approval is necessary to satisfy (i) the then-applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3, (ii) any requirements under the Code relating to ISOs or for exemption from Section 162(m) of the Code, or (iii) any applicable law, regulation or rule (including the applicable regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange)), would:
