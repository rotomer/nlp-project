Exhibit 99.1 NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION SECOND QUARTER 2005 RESULTS SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME OF $50 MILLION ($0.11 PER SHARE) DENVER, July 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced second quarter net income of $50 million ($0.11 per share) compared with net income of $37 million ($0.08 per share) for the second quarter of 2004. Second quarter net income was impacted by a $30 million ($0.07 per share) impairment charge related to the sale of the Golden Grove zinc/copper operation in Australia. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $84 million ($0.19 per share). Second quarter highlights included: * Consolidated gold sales of 2.0 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $244 per ounce; * Net cash provided from operations of $136 million after a net working capital increase of $139 million and the physical delivery of gold to reduce debt by $48 million; and * Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments of $2.4 billion. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "As expected, our operating performance was consistent with our plan during the second quarter. We continue to expect stronger operating performance in the second half as we access higher grade ore, increase processing rates at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha and begin production at the Leeville mine in Nevada. Our development projects are proceeding according to plan and we continue to see encouraging exploration results, most notably in Ghana."
(1) Continuing operations exclude the Golden Grove zinc/copper mine. Newmont sold Golden Grove in July 2005. (2) In the first quarter of 2005, Newmont began reporting consolidated sales and consolidated costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold and per pound of copper in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Costs applicable to sales exclude depreciation, depletion and amortization, which are shown separately. FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW Second quarter 2005 net income was $50 million ($0.11 per share), compared with $37 million ($0.08 per share) for the second quarter of 2004. Net income for the second quarter was impacted by the following items: * a $29.6 million ($0.07 per share) impairment at Golden Grove in Australia; * a $6.6 million ($0.01 per share) benefit related to Australian tax consolidation; and * an $8.0 million ($0.02 per share) expense for litigation and related costs at Minahasa in Indonesia. These items had the net effect of reducing net income for the second quarter by $31 million ($0.07 per share). Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was impacted by $48 million ($0.11 per share) in non-cash, after-tax impairment charges related to the Ovacik mine in Turkey and the Company's investment in Kinross. For the second quarter of 2005, the Company sold 2,008,800 ounces of gold on a consolidated basis at an average realized price of $421 per ounce. For the second quarter of 2004, the Company's consolidated gold sales were 2,053,100 ounces at an average realized price of $395 per ounce. The Company generated net cash from operations of $136 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $280 million in the year ago quarter. A working capital increase of $139 million and the physical delivery of gold valued at $48 million to repay debt were primarily responsible for the lower reported cash from operations. The working capital increase was primarily attributable to the timing of concentrate shipments at Batu Hijau, a company-wide increase in materials and supply inventory, an increase in leach pad inventory at Yanacocha and a reduction in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- NORTH AMERICA
In Nevada, gold ounces sold increased 4% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 14% increase in mill throughput and a 10% increase in heap leach ore grade, partially offset by an 8% decrease in mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 14% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased diesel and other input commodity prices, as well as higher underground contract service costs. At Golden Giant in Canada, gold ounces sold in the second quarter of 2005 were comparable to 2004 as lower ore grade was offset by higher recovery. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 4% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. At Holloway in Canada, gold ounces sold increased 18% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004 due to a 13% increase in mill throughput and a 10% increase in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004 as a result of the increase in production. At La Herradura in Mexico, gold ounces sold increased 19% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of increased inventory processing. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 15% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004 resulting primarily from the increased gold production. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- SOUTH AMERICA At Yanacocha in Peru, gold ounces sold increased 17% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004 primarily due to an 18% increase in the grade of ore placed on leach pads as well as sales from inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce remained constant as increased input commodity prices, including diesel, were offset by the increase in production and by-product silver credits. At Kori Kollo in Bolivia, consolidated gold sales were 8,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $276 per ounce, as material from the Kori Kollo pit is being placed on the existing leach pad. Ore from the Kori Chaca pit will be processed on a new leach pad and processed for sale in the third quarter of 2005.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND At Pajingo in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 12% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 20% decrease in ore milled, as mine production was lower and low grade stockpiles that supplemented production in 2004 were exhausted. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 12%, primarily due to lower production. At Yandal in Australia, gold ounces sold increased 9% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 20% increase in mill ore grade, partially offset by a 5% decrease in tons milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 15% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to higher underground contract service costs, as well as increased steel and diesel costs. At Tanami in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 20% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 21% decline in ore grade from mining lower grade zones from the Callie underground deposit and processing lower grade stockpiles at Groundrush. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 24% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower gold production. At Kalgoorlie in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 5% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004 due to a build of in-process inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 6% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased diesel, reagent and power costs. At Martha in New Zealand, gold ounces sold increased 54% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 55% increase in ore grade due to mine sequencing. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 28% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased production that was partially offset by higher processing costs from milling harder ore. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- INDONESIA
At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper and gold sales decreased 19% and 11%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004. Access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was temporarily restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides in 2005. As a result, the mine plan and pit design were revised, resulting in the processing of harder ores and stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold each increased 18% during the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, due primarily to lower production and increased maintenance, consumable and labor costs. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- CENTRAL ASIA At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, gold ounces sold decreased 57% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, due to a 29% decrease in ore grade as well as slower recovery from leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 61% in the second quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the decrease in production. The Ovacik mine in Turkey was sold to a subsidiary of Koza Davetiye, a Turkish company in March 2005. Operations were suspended in August 2004. MERCHANT BANKING Newmont Capital manages the Company's royalty and marketable securities portfolios as well as provides in-house support for asset transactions. For the second quarter of 2005, royalty and dividend income was $21 million, up approximately 40% from the year ago quarter. At the end of the second quarter of 2005, the market value of the marketable equity securities portfolio was $633 million, an increase of $126 million from year-end 2004. During the second quarter of 2005, Newmont Capital executed an agreement with Oxiana Limited for the sale of the non-core Golden Grove zinc/copper operation in Australia. The transaction closed on July 26, 2005, with total consideration of approximately $205 million, including approximately $144 million in cash and 81.5 million shares of Oxiana Limited.
CASH, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND DEBT At the end of the second quarter, cash, short-term marketable securities and investments totaled $2.4 billion. Outstanding debt totaled $2.1 billion. Of the outstanding debt, $657 million was Batu Hijau project finance debt that is non-recourse to the Company. CAPITAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE The Leeville underground project in Nevada remains on schedule for initial gold production in the fourth quarter of 2005. The production shaft is 94% complete, to a depth of 1,710 feet. Hoisting from the completed ventilation shaft began in late June. Overall, construction is 73% complete. At the Phoenix project in Nevada, engineering is 100% complete and construction is 50% complete. Concrete placement is 76% complete. Initial gold production is expected by early 2006. Construction of a proposed 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada is awaiting final completion of the air permitting process; all other required permits have been approved and issued by the appropriate agencies. At the Ahafo project in Ghana, engineering and procurement are essentially complete. In the field, camp and general infrastructure construction is progressing, as are concrete works for the process plant. Major works on the process plant are on course with construction 47% complete. The first mining equipment has arrived on site and the initial truck and excavator fleets are due on site in the third quarter. The project is on schedule to deliver first gold production by the second half of 2006. At the Akyem Project in Ghana, a feasibility study update was completed in February 2005. An environmental impact statement was submitted to the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency in early May and a public hearing on the project occurred in late June. At Boddington in Australia, work continues on the feasibility study update with a development decision expected in 2006. EXPLORATION, ADVANCED PROJECTS, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Exploration expenditures were $39 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $29 million in the year ago quarter. Advanced projects, research and development expenditures were $14 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $18 million in the second quarter of 2004. Drilling programs in Nevada are yielding positive results at Gold Quarry and Phoenix. These drilling programs will continue through 2005 for potential reserve and non-reserve mineralization additions. At the Ahafo project in Ghana, exploration programs advanced the geologic understanding of the deposits in the north and south areas. New targets and extensions of known mineralization are being drilled with encouraging early results.
At the Minas Conga district in Peru, infill drilling at the Perol and Chailhuagon deposits is progressing on schedule to convert non-reserve mineralization to reserves by year-end. Early results generally confirm the current block model estimate. Exploration drilling at the Amaro prospect is encouraging and will be followed up with an infill drilling program to assess the non-reserve mineralization potential by year-end. 2005 GUIDANCE The Company expects consolidated gold sales of 8.4 -- 8.5 million ounces (6.5 -- 6.6 million equity ounces) at consolidated costs applicable to sales of $230 -- $240 per ounce in 2005. The Company expects consolidated copper sales of approximately 635 million pounds (approximately 350 million equity pounds) at consolidated costs applicable to sales of $0.53 per pound. The slightly lower gold sales outlook is primarily attributable to the sale of the non-core Golden Grove operation, an estimated 2% -- 3% decline in Nevada gold sales and lower expected copper and gold sales at Batu Hijau resulting from geotechnical pit and mine plan redesign. Gold sales are expected to be weighted to the second half of the year as new stripping capacity is put into service, higher grades are accessed, and Leeville begins production. For 2005, exploration expenditures are expected in the range of $145 -- $155 million, while advanced projects, research and development expenditures are estimated in the range of $60 -- $70 million. Exploration expenditures will remain focused on Ghana, Peru and Nevada. Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be $1.1 -- $1.2 billion. For site by site details, please refer to the supplemental capital expenditures, depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration worksheet provided with the news release on the Newmont web site (www.newmont.com), under Investor Information/News Releases.
