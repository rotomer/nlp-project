CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
This presentation contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, (i) estimates of future gold and other metals production and sales, (ii) estimates of future cash costs; (iii) estimates of reserves, and statements regarding future exploration spending or results and the replacement of reserves; and (iv) the timing or results of permitting, construction and production activities. Where the Company expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, gold and other metals price volatility, currency fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, as well as political and operational risks in the countries in which we operate and governmental regulation and judicial outcomes. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Company's other SEC filings. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to any "forward-looking statement" to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this presentation, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
