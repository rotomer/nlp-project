Exhibit 99.1 NEWMONT MINING ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME OF $126 MILLION ($0.28 PER SHARE) DENVER, Oct. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced third quarter net income of $126 million ($0.28 per share) compared with net income of $129 million ($0.29 per share) for the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter highlights included: * Consolidated gold sales of 2.2 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $238 per ounce; * Net cash provided from operations of $437 million; and * Cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and other short-term investments of $2.0 billion. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We realized higher gold prices again this quarter, averaging $435 per ounce for the quarter and $427 per ounce year to date. Although we continued to experience commodity price escalation and selective labor pressures during the third quarter, higher realized gold prices should enhance our operating margins in the fourth quarter. For the year, we expect to sell approximately 6.5 million equity ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of approximately $240 per ounce. Our development projects continue to proceed according to plan and we are confident that we will again replace reserves in 2005." FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW Third quarter 2005 net income was $126 million ($0.28 per share) compared with $129 million ($0.29 per share) for the third quarter of 2004. Results for the third quarter of 2005 were partially impacted by the following items which had the effect of increasing net income by $10 million ($0.03 per share): * a $15.0 million ($0.03 per share) expense for environmental litigation and reclamation costs at Minahasa in Indonesia; and * a $25.0 million ($0.06 per share) gain on the sale of Kinross Gold Corporation stock.
Results for the third quarter of 2004 were impacted by the following items which had the effect of decreasing net income by $7 million ($0.02 per share): * an $8 million ($0.02 per share) write down at Australia and Yanacocha; * a $6 million ($0.01 per share) Australian legacy site reclamation accrual; and * a $7 million ($0.01 per share) gain on the sale of Bronzewing. For the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold 2,164,200 ounces of gold on a consolidated basis at an average realized price of $435 per ounce. For the third quarter of 2004, the Company's consolidated gold sales were 2,233,800 ounces at an average realized price of $403 per ounce. The Company generated net cash from operations of $437 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $340 million in the year ago quarter. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - NORTH AMERICA In Nevada, gold ounces sold remained constant in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 as a 21% increase in mill throughput and a 23% increase in heap leach ore placed were offset by an 11% decrease in mill ore grade. Adverse mill grades were caused by poor underground mine conditions and an underground labor shortage impacting the production rates of higher grade underground ore zones. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 24% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to increased labor costs, diesel and other commodity prices and higher underground contract service costs. Significant increases in energy costs occurred following hurricanes in the Gulf Coast of the United States in mid-2005. Experienced miners, particularly in underground mines, remain in short supply in Nevada, with labor rates increasing in line with the shortfall. At Golden Giant in Canada, gold ounces sold increased 46% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, attributable to a 29% increase in mill throughput and a 16% increase in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 32% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the increase in production, partially offset by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. At Holloway in Canada, gold ounces sold remained constant in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. A 24% decrease in ore grade was offset by a 4% increase in mill throughput and higher sales from inventory built in 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 65% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004 as a result of increased development and definition drilling costs and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. At La Herradura in Mexico, gold ounces sold increased 30% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004 primarily due to favorable timing of flows from the leach pads. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - SOUTH AMERICA
At Yanacocha in Peru, gold ounces sold remained constant in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 as a 32% increase in ore placed on the leach pads and a 5% increase in ore grade were offset by the timing of flows from the leach pads and increased inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce also remained constant as increased labor and commodity costs, including diesel, were offset by the increase in production and the allocation of costs to inventory. At Kori Kollo in Bolivia, additional material from the Kori Kollo pit was placed on the existing leach pad. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, Kori Kollo also began processing ore from the Kori Chaca pit on a new leach pad. This resulted in a significant increase in ounces sold for the third quarter compared to the comparative period of 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased significantly period to period primarily as a result of the increased production. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND At Pajingo in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 7% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 20% decrease in ore milled, as low grade stockpiles which supplemented production in 2004 have been exhausted, partially offset by an 11% increase in ore grade milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 15%, primarily due to lower production and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. At Jundee in Australia, gold ounces sold increased 6% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 7% increase in ore grade milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to higher underground contract services, diesel costs, and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. At Tanami in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 32% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 21% decline in ore grade from the Callie underground deposit, processing lower grade stockpiles at Groundrush, and a 15% decrease in mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 21% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower gold production, higher diesel costs and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. At Kalgoorlie in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 27% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004 primarily due to a 20% decline in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 28% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower production and increased diesel, reagent and power costs, as well as the appreciation of the Australian dollar.
At Martha in New Zealand, gold ounces sold remained constant in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004. A 9% decrease in ore milled was offset by a 3% increase in ore grade and a 4% increase in recovery. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 5% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of higher by-product revenue, partially offset by higher processing costs from harder ore. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - INDONESIA At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper sales decreased 4% and gold sales increased 21% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper remained constant while costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold increased 8% during the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004. Overall, operating costs increased primarily as a result of increased fuel, maintenance, consumable, power and labor costs. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS - CENTRAL ASIA At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, gold ounces sold decreased 37% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, due to a 3% decrease in ore grade and lower production from leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 27% in the third quarter of 2005 from the third quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the decrease in production and higher energy costs. The Ovacik mine in Turkey was sold on March 1, 2005 to a Turkish company. Operations were suspended in August 2004.
MERCHANT BANKING Newmont Capital manages the Company's royalty and marketable securities portfolios, as well as providing in-house merchant banking support. For the third quarter of 2005, royalty and dividend income was $18 million, 10% lower than the year ago quarter. Year-to-date income was $57 million, up approximately 19% over the comparable period last year. At the end of the third quarter of 2005, the market value of the marketable equity securities portfolio, after the sale of Kinross Gold Corporation stock, was $881 million, an increase of $374 million from year-end 2004. During the third quarter of 2005, Newmont Capital sold the Company's remaining position in Kinross Gold Corporation for cash proceeds of $111 million and a realized a pre-tax gain of $20 million. The sale of the Golden Grove zinc/copper operation closed in July and generated cash proceeds of $142 million. A prefeasibility study by outside consultants on Newmont's 100% owned Alberta heavy oil project was completed during the quarter. The study estimated that 165 million barrels are economically recoverable via steam assisted gravity drainage wells with the potential for production of 25,000 barrels per day via phased development. Newmont plans to complete environmental base line studies and an infill well program in the first quarter of 2007, with potential application for development in 2007. The Company will subsequently evaluate value-realization options in 2007. CASH, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND DEBT At the end of the third quarter, cash, short-term marketable securities and other short-term investments totaled $2.0 billion. Outstanding debt totaled $2.0 billion. Of the outstanding debt, $657 million was Batu Hijau debt that is non-recourse to the Company. CAPITAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE The Leeville underground project in Nevada began gold production in the third quarter of 2005. The production shaft excavation is 94% complete to a depth of 1,710 feet. Current plans call for the production shaft to begin hoisting ore in the second quarter of 2006. Overall, construction is approximately 80% complete with the shotcrete plant coming on line in November. Prior to completion, gold production will occur from stopes that have been developed in parallel with construction. At the Phoenix project in Nevada, overall construction is approximately 70% complete. Initial gold production is expected by the second quarter of 2006. Construction of a proposed 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada is awaiting final completion of the air permitting process; all other required permits have been approved and issued by the appropriate agencies. Project engineering is 30% complete. The targeted project completion date remains mid-2008, depending on the air permitting process. At the Ahafo project in Ghana, engineering and procurement are essentially complete, with the camp and general infrastructure construction progressing as planned and the process plant just over 50% complete. Overall project construction is approximately 60% complete. Mining equipment is arriving and being assembled on schedule, with plans to start mining in early 2006. Operations planning, staffing and training are progressing according to plan and the project is on schedule to deliver first gold production by the second half of 2006. The Akyem project in Ghana was approved by the Newmont Board of Directors in July 2005. An environmental impact statement was submitted to the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency in early May. Production is expected to commence in the second half of 2008. At Boddington in Australia, work continues on the feasibility study update with a development decision expected in 2006.
EXPLORATION, ADVANCED PROJECTS, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Exploration expenditures were $41 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared with $28 million in the year ago quarter. Advanced projects, research and development expenditures were $18 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared with $25 million in the third quarter of 2004. At the Minas Conga district in Peru, infill drilling intended to convert non-reserve mineralization to reserves this year at the Perol and Chailhuagon deposits is complete. Drill assay results as well as ongoing resource modeling and engineering are advancing economic evaluations. Follow-up drilling at the Amaro prospect continues to yield encouraging results with the potential addition of reserves by year-end. At the Ahafo project in Ghana, development drilling programs advanced the geologic understanding of the deposits in the north and south areas. The addition of reserves at Ahafo by year-end is possible as the result of new drill information, updated block models and optimized engineering. Drilling of new exploration targets and extensions of known mineralization provided encouraging results. Drilling programs in Nevada yielded positive results at the Carlin Trend and Phoenix with reserve and non-reserve mineralization additions possible by year-end. Development drilling at the Tanami and Jundee underground operations in Australia demonstrated positive results for the potential conversion of non-reserve mineralization to reserves by year-end. Extension drilling at Martha in New Zealand has provided encouraging results. 2005 GUIDANCE The Company expects consolidated gold sales of approximately 8.6 million ounces (approximately 6.5 million equity ounces) at costs applicable to sales of approximately $240 per ounce in 2005. The Company expects consolidated copper sales of approximately 625 million pounds (approximately 330 million equity pounds) at costs applicable to sales of $0.47 per pound. Lower expected copper sales at Batu Hijau are primarily the result of geotechnical issues experienced in the first quarter. Higher costs applicable to sales in Nevada in 2005 resulted primarily from lower underground production caused by adverse ground conditions and skilled labor shortages. To a lesser extent, ongoing input commodity price escalation continues to adversely impact operating costs in Nevada. The Company expects cost pressures in Nevada to continue into 2006. At Yanacocha in Peru, depending on further mine plan optimization efforts, gold sales are expected to decline by 10% to 20% in 2006. For 2005, exploration expenditures are expected in the range of $145 - $150 million, while advanced projects, research and development expenditures are estimated in the range of $60 - $70 million. Exploration expenditures will remain focused on Ghana, Peru, Nevada and Australia. For 2005, the Company again expects to replace reserves. Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be $1.1 - $1.2 billion.
