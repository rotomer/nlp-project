Fourth Quarter and 2005 Results
News Release
2005 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $374 MILLION ($0.84 PER SHARE); RECORD EQUITY GOLD RESERVES OF 93.2 MILLION OUNCES AT YEAR-END
DENVER, February 27, 2006  Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $72 million ($0.16 per share) and 2005 income from continuing operations of $374 million ($0.84 per share). Newmont also reported industry-leading cash from operations of $1.25 billion for 2005, as well as record proven and probable gold reserves of 93.2 million equity ounces at year-end 2005, based on a gold price assumption of $400 per ounce. Other fourth quarter and 2005 highlights included:
 
 
 
Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "For 2005, we again generated industry leading operating cash flow, despite lower earnings resulting from industry-wide cost pressures and the impact of several non-cash accounting write-downs. We also achieved our goal of replacing depletion for the fourth straight year. As we look to 2006 and beyond, we are excited about the opportunities our newest initiatives will provide to improve our cost structure and competitive position in the industry. This year we will complete the Phoenix and Leeville projects in Nevada, plus the Ahafo project in Ghana. In 2008, we expect to complete the Nevada power plant, the Akyem project in Ghana, and the Boddington project in Australia."
 
 
EXPLORATION AND RESERVES HIGHLIGHTS
For 2005, the Company added 9.4 million equity ounces of reserves through exploration, offsetting 8.6 million equity ounces of depletion and divestments. 2005 exploration highlights include:
 
 
 
Of the 9.4 million equity ounces added to reserves during 2005, 6.8 million ounces were added from the drill bit, while 2.6 million ounces were added as a result of a higher gold price assumption ($400 per ounce).
Subsequent to December 31, 2005, pro forma year-end equity reserves increased by 3.6 million ounces to 96.8 million ounces resulting from the acquisitions of the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project in Ghana and an additional 22.22% of the Boddington project in Australia (under contract), partially offset by a 0.2 million ounce reduction at Zarafshan due to a revision to the ore supply agreement.
 
 
FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
Fourth quarter 2005 income from continuing operations was $72 million ($0.16 per share), compared with $150 million ($0.34 per share) for the fourth quarter 2004. For 2005, income from continuing operations was $374 million ($0.84 per share), compared with $453 million ($1.02 per share) for 2004. Income for the fourth quarter was impacted by the following:
 
These items had the net effect of decreasing income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 by $84 million ($0.19 per share) and increasing income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 by $20 million ($0.06 per share). For 2005, income from continuing operations was reduced by $34 million ($0.07 per share) as a result of numerous similar transactions.
1
The Company generated net cash from continuing operations of $489 million in the fourth quarter and $1.25 billion for 2005.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  NEVADA
 
In Nevada, gold ounces sold decreased 7% in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 as an 8% increase in mill throughput and a 14% increase in heap leach ore placed were offset by a 14% decrease in mill ore grade. Adverse mill grades were caused by unfavorable ground conditions at underground operations and a continuing underground labor shortage impacting production rates from higher grade underground ore zones. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 25% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower volumes, increased labor and underground contract service costs, as well as higher diesel and other commodity prices. Experienced miners, particularly underground miners, remain in short supply in Nevada, with labor rates increasing commensurate with the shortfall.
 
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  YANACOCHA
 
At Yanacocha in Peru, gold ounces sold increased 25% in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 due to a 15% increase in ore placed and reduction of precipitate inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 10% as increased labor and commodity costs, including diesel, were partially offset by the increase in production.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND
 
At Pajingo in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 27% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 24% decrease in ore milled as low grade stockpiles that supplemented production in 2004 have been exhausted. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 11%, primarily due to lower production.
At Jundee in Australia, gold ounces sold increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 6% increase in ore milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 2% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to higher underground contract services and diesel costs.
At Tanami in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to a 33% decrease in mill throughput, primarily due to the completion of mining at Groundrush in 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce remained constant in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, as higher underground support and diesel costs were offset by the cessation of milling operations at Groundrush in August 2005.
At Kalgoorlie in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to an 18% decline in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 27% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower production and increased diesel, reagent and power costs.
At Martha in New Zealand, gold ounces sold decreased 12% in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily the result of a 9% decrease in ore milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce
remained constant in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily a result of higher by-product revenue offset by higher processing costs from harder ore.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  BATU HIJAU
 
At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper sales decreased 22% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to an 18% decrease in ore milled and a 10% decrease in ore grade. Gold sales remained constant in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004 as an 18% decrease in ore milled was offset by a 15% increase in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and ounce of gold increased 25% and 19%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating costs increased primarily as a result of higher fuel, maintenance, consumable, power and labor costs.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  OTHER
 
At Golden Giant in Canada, gold ounces sold increased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, attributable to a 28% increase in mill throughput and a 5% increase in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 10% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the increase in production, partially offset by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
At La Herradura in Mexico, gold ounces sold increased 9% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to favorable timing of flows from the leach pads.
At Kori Kollo in Bolivia, additional material from the Kori Kollo pit was placed on the existing leach pad. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, Kori Kollo also began processing ore from the Kori Chaca pit on a new leach pad. This resulted in a significant increase in ounces sold for the fourth quarter compared to the comparative period of 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased significantly period to period, primarily as a result of the increased production.
At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, gold ounces sold decreased 24% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, due to a 5% decrease in ore grade and lower production from leach pads. Costs applicable to
sales per ounce increased 42% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the decrease in production and higher energy costs.
MERCHANT BANKING
Newmont Capital is responsible for the Company's merchant banking activities, which include management of the royalty, equity and asset portfolios, as well as in-house investment banking and advisory services. For the fourth quarter of 2005, royalty and dividend income was $23 million, 24% higher than the year ago quarter. For 2005, royalty and dividend income was $79 million, up approximately 20% over last year. At the end of 2005, the market value of the marketable equity securities portfolio was $940 million, an increase of $433 million from year-end 2004. Growth in the equity portfolio in 2005 resulted primarily from an 80% return on average invested capital.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Newmont reached an agreement to purchase the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project. The transaction closed on January 20, 2006. During the first quarter of 2006, Newmont reached an agreement to acquire an additional 22.22% interest in the Boddington project from Newcrest Mining Limited, increasing Newmont's ownership in the project to 66.67%, with AngloGold Ashanti owning the remaining 33.33%. Closing is expected by April 2006.
Environmental baseline studies and infill drilling are ongoing at Newmont's 100% owned Alberta oil sands project. A prefeasibility study estimated that 165 million barrels are economically recoverable via steam assisted gravity drainage wells with the potential for production of 25,000 barrels per day.
CAPITAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
The Leeville underground project in Nevada is approximately 86% complete. The production shaft reached its final depth in November 2005. Dewatering has been successful and the groundwater level is now below the production shaft bottom. The remaining construction work primarily relates to construction of underground facilities. Production ramp up is scheduled to achieve 2,100 tons per day of mine output by the end of 2006.
At the Phoenix project in Nevada, construction is approximately 96% complete. Commissioning of the process plant began in January 2006. Initial gold production is expected by April 2006.
Construction of the 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada was approved by the Newmont Board of Directors in January 2006 after receipt of the final air permit. Project engineering is currently 50% complete. Construction has commenced and the estimated completion date is mid-2008.
At the Ahafo project in Ghana, engineering, procurement, camp and general infrastructure construction are essentially complete. The process plant, including the tailings storage facility and water storage facility, is approximately 76% complete, with overall project construction approximately 83% complete at the end of January 2006. Mining commenced January 9, 2006 and the project is on schedule to deliver first gold production in the second half of 2006.
The Akyem project in Ghana was approved by the Newmont Board of Directors in July 2005. An environmental impact statement was submitted to the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency in May 2005. Construction is expected to commence after approval of the environmental impact statement, with initial production expected in the second half of 2008.
EXPLORATION, ADVANCED PROJECTS, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
Exploration expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $31 million in the year ago quarter. Advanced projects, research and development expenditures were $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. For 2005, exploration expenditures were $147 million, with advanced projects, research and development expenditures totaling $73 million.
In the Conga district in Peru, infill drilling resulted in the conversion of non-reserve mineralization (NRM) to reserves at the Perol and Chailhuagon deposits. Assay results, as well as ongoing resource modeling and engineering, are advancing economic evaluations. Follow-up drilling at the Amaro prospect yielded encouraging results, adding NRM at year-end.
In the Ahafo district in Ghana, development drilling programs advanced the geologic understanding of the deposits in the north and south areas. Drilling of new exploration targets and extensions of known mineralization provided positive results throughout the year.
Drill programs in Nevada yielded positive results at the Carlin Trend and Phoenix, resulting in reserve and NRM additions totaling 2.5 million ounces for the year.
Development drilling at the Tanami, Jundee and Martha underground operations in Australia and New Zealand yielded conversion of NRM to reserves.
The Company also updated its equity gold reserve price sensitivity. As illustrated below, if calculated at gold prices of $425 and $450 per ounce, gold reserves would increase to approximately 99 million ounces and 104 million ounces, respectively, all other assumptions remaining constant. The full impact of higher gold prices on gold reserves remains constrained by limited drill data on the margins of known mineralization.
