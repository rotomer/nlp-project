At a meeting on March 17, 2006, the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture ("ZNJV"), which is 50 percent owned by Newmont Mining Corporation (the "Corporation"), was verbally notified by the Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance that it would like to renegotiate or eliminate Decree 151 during 2006. Decree 151 is a governmental decree that protects ZNJV from changes in tax laws and provides other financial and operational benefits. ZNJV's joint venture agreement with the government of Uzbekistan provides that the tax protection and financial and operational benefits provided by Decree 151 are to remain in effect for so long as ZNJV has ongoing operations. The Corporation does not believe that any amendment to Decree 151 is warranted or appropriate, but we cannot predict the outcome of these discussions at this time. Depending on the outcome, the amendment or elimination of Decree 151 could adversely affect the results of the ZNJV operation.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
