Exhibit 99.1 NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION FIRST QUARTER 2006 RESULTS First Quarter Income From Continuing Operations Rises to $213 Million ($0.48 Per Share); On Rising Gold Prices and Targeted Operating Performance DENVER, April 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced first quarter income from continuing operations of $213 million ($0.48 per share) compared with $85 million ($0.19 per share) for the first quarter of 2005. First quarter net income from continuing operations was positively impacted by a $48 million ($0.11 per share) tax adjustment. First quarter highlights included: * Consolidated gold sales of 1.8 million ounces (1.4 million equity ounces) at costs applicable to sales of $275 per ounce and an average realized gold price of $555 per ounce; * Net cash provided by continuing operations of $240 million, after a $164 million increase in working capital; and * Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. Wayne W. Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our first quarter's results reflect strong margin and earnings per share growth from a higher realized gold price of $555 per ounce and our continued focus on cost containment. With the current gold price in excess of $600 per ounce, we expect to deliver expanding gold margins for our shareholders." 1. Includes 14,200 ounces sold in 2006 from incidental sales during start- up at Leeville and Phoenix, and 13,300 ounces in 2006 (20,000 in 2005) from the Holloway discontinued operation. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW First quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was $213 million ($0.48 per share), compared with $85 million ($0.19 per share) for the first quarter of 2005. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was impacted by the following items:
These items had the net effect of increasing income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2006 by $46 million ($0.11 per share) and increasing income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 by $30 million ($0.06 per share). The Company generated net cash from continuing operations of $240 million in the first quarter of 2006, after a $164 million increase in working capital. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS In Nevada, gold ounces sold decreased 9% during the first quarter of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of a 14% decrease in mill ore grade. The decrease in mill ore grade resulted from mining lower grades at the Midas and Deep Post underground mines. Mill throughput was lower as a result of 14 days of unplanned downtime at Mill 5. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 28%, primarily due to a decrease in ounces produced and increased labor, diesel, cyanide and underground contract service costs, as well as a change in accounting for deferred stripping. During the second quarter, costs applicable to sales per ounce are expected to temporarily increase as a result of regularly planned annual maintenance at Mill 6.
At Yanacocha, gold ounces sold remained constant in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005 as a 25% increase in ore grade and a 19% increase in tons of ore placed were offset by the timing of flows from the leach pads. The increase in ore placed resulted from an increase in tons mined and lower waste removal at the La Quinua and Yanacocha pits. Ore grade also increased at La Quinua, as mining accessed higher grade ore at the bottom of the pit. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to the increase in tons mined, increased consumption of higher priced commodities, and from higher labor and royalty costs resulting from increased gold prices. In Australia and New Zealand, gold ounces sold declined 24% in the first quarter of 2006 as compared with the same period in 2005, primarily due to lower grades at Kalgoorlie, Jundee and Martha, combined with lower throughput at Tanami and Pajingo. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 27% in the first quarter of 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the decrease in ounces sold. At Tanami in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 26% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a 30% decline in mill throughput resulting from the completion of processing Groundrush stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 19%, primarily due to lower gold production. At Kalgoorlie in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 19% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a 19% decrease in ore grade milled and a 7% decrease in tons milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 43%, primarily due to lower gold production, and increased maintenance, diesel and reagent costs. At Jundee in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 29% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a 12% decrease in tons milled and a 17% decrease in mill ore grade. The decrease in tons milled was attributable to severe weather conditions and flooding, causing an extended mill shutdown. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 25%, primarily attributable to lower gold production and higher maintenance costs. At Pajingo in Australia, gold ounces sold decreased 27% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a 32% decrease in tons milled resulting from ground control and ventilation system repairs. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 26%, primarily due to lower production. At Martha in New Zealand, gold ounces sold decreased 17% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a 19% decrease in mill ore grade and a 9% decrease in ore milled, partially offset by higher recovery. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 6%, primarily due to decreased production and higher waste removal.
At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper sales decreased 19% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005 due to reduced mill tons processed, attributable to harder ore, and an increase in concentrate inventory at quarter end. Gold sales decreased 3%, as the lower mill tons processed and higher concentrate inventory were offset by a 26% increase in gold grade milled. The decrease in copper production resulted in a 14% increase in costs applicable to sales per pound of copper. Batu Hijau also revised its mine plan to address geotechnical instability in the operation's east pit wall. Consolidated sales for 2006 are now expected to be approximately 472 million pounds of copper at costs applicable to sales of $0.64 per pound and 460,000 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $162 per ounce. At Golden Giant in Canada, mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005. Mining and milling of in-circuit inventory ounces in the first quarter of 2006 was higher than expected, resulting in gold sales of 34,100 ounces. At Zarafshan in Uzbekistan, gold ounces sold decreased 14% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to the timing of flows from the leach pads. Tons placed on the leach pads increased 18% due to milder weather conditions. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 19%, primarily as a result of the lower production. At Kori Kollo in Bolivia, gold ounces sold increased significantly in the first quarter of 2006 from the placement of additional material from the Kori Kollo pit on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit on the new leach pad. Production in the first quarter of 2005 resulted from residual leaching from an existing leach pad. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 39% in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of increased production. At La Herradura in Mexico, gold ounces sold increased 7% in the first quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2005, primarily as a result of favorable timing of flows from the leach pads, as the grade of ore placed on the leach pads decreased 26%. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased by 32%, primarily due to an increase in waste tons mined and increased labor, diesel and other commodity costs. At the discontinued Holloway operation in Canada, gold ounces sold decreased 33% to 13,300 equity ounces. The Company is placing the operation on care and maintenance at the end of April, as it considers value realization alternatives.
MERCHANT BANKING Newmont Capital is responsible for the Company's merchant banking activities, including the management of all royalty, equity and asset portfolios, as well as in-house investment banking and advisory services. Newmont achieved record quarterly royalty and dividend income of $29 million, 62% higher than the year ago quarter, driven primarily by higher realized commodity prices. The market value of the marketable equity securities portfolio grew to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter versus $940 million at the start of the year, driven by capital appreciation. Unrealized pre-tax gains in the portfolio were more than $725 million at quarter-end. During the quarter, the Company acquired the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project and an additional 22.2% interest in the Boddington project. These two acquisitions add 3.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves. Subsequent to quarter end, Newmont closed a private placement and ore purchase agreement with Queenstake Resources Ltd. A third season of winter drilling and baseline Environmental Impact Assessment was completed at Newmont's 100% owned Alberta oil sands project. The independent engineering estimate was also updated. Scotia Waterous has been engaged as Newmont's advisor to review value realization alternatives for this asset. CAPITAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE The Leeville underground mine in Nevada is approximately 89% complete. Remaining work primarily relates to construction of underground facilities. Production ramp-up is expected to achieve 2,100 tons per day by the end of 2006. Steady-state production of 3,200 tons per day is expected to be achieved by the end of 2007. The Phoenix mine in Nevada is ramping up to its design production rate of 35,000 tons per day. First gold was shipped from Phoenix in March. Phoenix is expected to produce approximately 350,000 ounces of gold and approximately 20-25 million pounds of copper per year on a steady-state basis. Construction of the 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada was approved by the Newmont Board of Directors in January 2006 after receipt of the final air permit. Project engineering is over 50% complete and construction has commenced. The estimated completion date is mid-2008. The Ahafo project in Ghana is 95% complete. Ore is currently being stockpiled for process start-up and commissioning in June and the project is expected to deliver first gold production in the second half of 2006. The Akyem project in Ghana was approved by the Newmont Board of Directors in July 2005. An environmental impact statement was submitted to the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency in August 2005. Once the environmental impact statement is approved, construction is planned to commence along with a detailed review of capital costs and production timing. The Boddington project in Australia was approved by the Newmont Board of Directors in February of this year. Construction of the project is expected to commence in the second half of 2006, with Newmont's share of the capital cost expected to be approximately $900 million to $1.0 billion. Initial gold production is expected in late 2008 or early 2009. EXPLORATION, ADVANCED PROJECTS, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Exploration expenditures were $33 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $26 million in the year ago quarter. Advanced projects, research and development expenditures were $21 million in the first quarter of 2006 as compared with $17 million in the first quarter of 2005.
In Ghana, ore body extensions at depth in south Ahafo continue to provide encouraging results that justify follow up drilling, with potential underground mining opportunities being evaluated. In Nevada, encouraging first quarter results at Gold Quarry, Genesis, Twin Creeks and Phoenix will require further drilling targeted at reserve and non-reserve material additions. In Peru, drill programs are focused on oxide targets in the Yanacocha district and in the Conga region. In Australia, positive drill results at KCGM underground and Tanami will be followed up this year. In New Zealand, down dip offsets at Favona indicate potential ore body extensions. 2006 GUIDANCE The Company expects to sell approximately 7.70-7.90 million consolidated ounces of gold (6.10-6.25 million equity ounces) at costs applicable to sales of approximately $280-$295 per ounce. The Company also expects to sell approximately 470-475 million consolidated pounds of copper (250-255 million equity pounds) at costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.60-$0.65 per pound.
