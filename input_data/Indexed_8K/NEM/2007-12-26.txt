On December 20, 2007, the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement described in Item 1.01 above were completed, resulting in the sale of certain of the Corporation's royalty assets and other non-core investments to Franco-Nevada Corporation for gross cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion.
Certain directors and officers of Franco-Nevada are former officers or directors of the Corporation. Pierre Lassonde is Director (Chairman) of Franco-Nevada. Mr. Lassonde was a director of the Corporation until November 2007 (when he resigned), and was President of the Corporation until December 2006 (when he retired).

Paul Brink is Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Business Development of Franco-Nevada. Mr. Brink was Director, Business Development for the Corporation until December 2007.

but only, in each such case, to the extent that they relate in whole or in part to Petroleum Substances within, upon or under the Lands and subject to the limitations as to geological formations and stratigraphic zones set out in or contemplated by Schedule E to the Disclosure Letter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 5.5), effective on or before the Closing and, in the case of the transfer to New AusCo, on the later of (i) on or before Closing and (ii) within two Business Days following the satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 6.1(e) and 6.2(e), Seller shall cause each Existing Holding Subsidiary to transfer to one or more of the newly-formed subsidiaries of Seller (each a "New Holding Subsidiary" and collectively the "New Holding Subsidiaries") all rights, titles and interests of such Existing Holding Subsidiary in and to the Assets, other than the Directly Transferred Assets, as more particularly set forth in Schedule D to the Disclosure Letter.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at Closing Seller shall sell and convey (or cause the Existing Holding Subsidiaries to sell and convey) to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase for the Purchase Price, (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the New Holding Subsidiaries (the "Shares"), free and clear of all Encumbrances, and (ii) all of the Existing Holding Subsidiaries' right, title and interest in and to the Directly Transferred Assets.
 
The purchase price for the Shares and the Existing Holding Subsidiaries' right, title and interest in and to the Directly Transferred Assets shall be equal to the following:

All amounts payable or receivable or accrued (other than pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) or paid or received under the Royalty Instruments and the Title and Operating Documents or otherwise with respect to the Assets with respect to periods prior to and including the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Existing Holding Subsidiaries, and all amounts payable or receivable or paid or received under the Royalty Instruments and the Title and Operating Documents or otherwise with respect to the Assets with respect to periods after the Closing Date are for the account of the New Holding Subsidiaries and Buyer (in the case of the Directly Transferred Assets).

Seller represents, warrants and acknowledges to Buyer as follows:
 
Seller and each Existing Holding Subsidiary is or, in the case of the Existing Holding Subsidiary to be formed upon the amalgamation of Newmont Mining Corporation of
 
Canada Limited and Redstone Resources Inc., will be a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has all requisite power and authority to hold its respective Assets and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement. Each Existing Holding Subsidiary is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller.
 
As of Closing, each of the New Holding Subsidiaries will be a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and will have all requisite power and authority to hold and operate the Assets conveyed to it pursuant to Section 2.1.
 
The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Seller have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller, and is the valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms. Seller has caused, or will have caused by the Closing, the Existing Holding Subsidiaries to have taken all such corporate action as is necessary by such entities to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
Each New Holding Subsidiary will be an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller. Except for the Shares, there will not be outstanding as of Closing any shares of capital stock of any New Holding Subsidiary or other securities, or except as contemplated by this Agreement any options, warrants, subscriptions or other rights of any Person to acquire, or any instruments that are convertible into, any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any New Holding Subsidiary.
 
Except as described on or contemplated by Schedule 3.5 to the Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery, and performance by Seller or the Existing Holding Subsidiaries of this Agreement do not and will not:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to its title to the Assets. Except as specifically contemplated in this Agreement, as of Closing, the New Holding Subsidiaries and Buyer will hold the rights, titles and interests currently held by the Existing Holding Subsidiaries in the Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances created by, through or under the Existing Holding Subsidiaries or New Holding Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Encumbrances.
 
Seller has made available to Buyer true and correct copies of the Royalty Instruments and Title and Operating Documents, including all material amendments or modifications thereto. None of the Existing Holding Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Seller, any other party to the Royalty Instruments or the Title and Operating Documents is in default of any obligation under the Royalty Instruments or Title and Operating Documents (other than obligations related to payment or remittances), which would reasonably be considered to be a material default thereunder.
 
Seller has made available to Buyer a materially true and correct statement of the revenues to the Existing Holding Subsidiaries attributable to the Assets during calendar years 2004, 2005 and 2006, as well as the nine-month period ending September 30, 2007. Except as described in Schedule 3.8 to the Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2004, no Operator has withheld, failed to pay, or threatened to not make payment of any material amount in respect of any period for which such payment is or was required to be made under any Royalty Instrument or Title and Operating Document, which withholding, failure or threat has not been resolved and such amounts paid by the Closing Date. Except as described in Schedule 3.8 to the Disclosure Letter, at the Closing Date, there are no outstanding disagreements with respect to the calculation of any material payment under any Royalty Instrument.
 
There is no Litigation to which Seller or its Affiliates are a party, the subject of which are the Assets (or any of them), or the Royalty Instruments or Title and Operating Documents or any of them, or which regards the payment or non-payment of any amount under a
 
Royalty Instrument or Title and Operating Document, or which regards the performance or non-performance of any obligation under a Royalty Instrument or Title and Operating Document, or which directly challenges the validity or enforceability of a Royalty Instrument or Title and Operating Document, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for any such Litigation which arises out of or results from the Third Party Purchase Rights or which could not reasonably be expected to (i) have a material adverse effect on the Assets taken as a whole, (ii) materially impede the completion of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, or (iii) have any materially adverse effect on the Royalty Instruments which establish the royalties over the Goldstrike Complex or the Stillwater Complex.
 
Except only for the Assumed Liabilities and as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, as of Closing the New Holding Subsidiaries will have no other liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether accrued, contingent or actual). As of Closing, the New Holding Subsidiaries will have no other assets other than that portion of the Assets conveyed to it, or to be conveyed to it, pursuant to this Agreement.
 
To Seller's knowledge, all royalties and ad valorem, property, production, severance and similar Taxes and assessments based on or measured by the Existing Holding Subsidiaries' ownership of the Oil and Gas Assets, the production of Petroleum Substances or the receipt of proceeds therefrom that are due and payable by the Existing Holding Subsidiaries prior to the Closing have been or will have been properly paid and discharged.
 
Other than as set out in Schedule 3.12 to the Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding AFEs the Existing Holding Subsidiaries' share of which is in excess of Cdn$500,000 for which the New Holding Subsidiaries will be liable, other than usual operating expenses incurred in the normal conduct of operations.
 
Except as set out in Schedule 3.13, each Existing Holding Subsidiary that will sell taxable Canadian property for the purposes of the (Canada) is not a non-resident of Canada for the purposes of the (Canada). None of the Shares (other than shares of the capital stock of a New Holding Subsidiary that is a resident of Canada for the purposes of the (Canada)) constitutes "taxable Canadian property" for the purposes of the (Canada).

In formulating a decision to enter into this Agreement,
 
 
 
Buyer meets all qualification requirements of all Governmental Authorities and under the Regulations to hold the New Holding Subsidiaries.
 
BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 3, SELLER MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SELLER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ASSETS WILL BE CONVEYED BY THE EXISTING HOLDING SUBSIDIARIES TO THE NEW HOLDING SUBSIDIARIES OR BUYER, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AS-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS. Except for representations made by the Seller in Article 3, Buyer acknowledges that it is relying solely upon its own investigations with respect to, and that Seller does not expressly or implicitly represent or warrant title to the Assets or make any representations or warranties with respect to, the following matters:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Without restricting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that it has made (and will, prior to Closing, continue to make) its own independent evaluation and inspection of the Assets and their condition as part of its due diligence process, and that, subject to Article 3, it has relied on that independent review for its assessment of the condition, quantum and value of the Assets.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seller shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer on Closing forms of all requests for consents and approvals of Governmental Authorities and other Persons required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for compliance with the requirements of any Third Party Purchase Rights, which is governed by Section 5.4), which Buyer shall obtain from such Governmental Authorities and other Persons following Closing, and Buyer shall cooperate reasonably with such efforts of Seller. Seller shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer all forms of notices required to be delivered by it under the Royalty Instruments and Title and Operating Documents as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which Buyer shall deliver to the applicable third parties pursuant to the Royalty Instruments and Title and Operating Documents following Closing.
 
 
 
 
 
If prior to or following Closing any Person asserts that it has rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or other rights to purchase or acquire any Assets as a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the IPO ("Third Party Purchase Rights"), Seller shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide written notice of such assertion to Buyer as well as the details of any Litigation related thereto and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate both before and after Closing to resolve such claims as expeditiously as possible on terms that involve the payment to Buyer of all consideration and proceeds resulting from the sale or other disposition to any such Person of any Assets pursuant to any Third Party Purchase Rights. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Purchase Price shall not be reduced as the result of the existence or exercise of any Third Party Purchase Rights, and Seller shall have no rights to any consideration or proceeds payable or resulting from the exercise of any Third Party Purchase Rights.
 
As soon as practicable following Closing, Seller shall, subject to Section 2.7 (including, for greater certainty, the obligation of Buyer to reimburse Seller for such expenses),
 
at its expense complete all recording of instruments and associated filings with Governmental Authorities required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by Section 2.1 and provide the original recorded instruments and copies of such filings to Buyer. For greater certainty, Buyer shall, at its expense, complete all recording of instruments and associated filings with Governmental Authorities required for consummation of the transfer of the Directly Transferred Assets pursuant to Section 2.2.
 
Buyer shall not (i) amend the subscription agreements in respect of the Management and Board Placement or (ii) consent to any Transfer (as such term is defined in the subscription agreements in respect of the Management and Board Placement) of the common shares of Buyer issued pursuant to the Management and Board Placement, in each case, which would have the effect of allowing such common shares to be Transferred (as such term is defined in the subscription agreements in respect of the Management and Board Placement), directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever prior to the three year anniversary of the IPO Closing Date other than as currently contemplated in Article 5 of such subscription agreements. Buyer agrees that, in the event of a breach of this covenant by Buyer, Seller would suffer damages in respect of each Transferred common share in an amount per share equal to the difference between the average subscription price per share of such common shares (being Cdn$7.60) and Cdn$15.20 (being the offering price of such shares under the IPO) and Buyer would be obligated to pay such amount as liquidated damages. Buyer further acknowledges that such amount is a genuine estimate of damages and is not a penalty.
 
The obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions, which may be waived by Buyer:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided that if this condition is not satisfied by the Closing, then the purchase and sale of the shares of NewAusCo shall not be completed on the Closing Date, but shall be completed on the second Business Day following the date that paragraph (i) or (ii) of this condition shall have occurred, and the Buyer hereby irrevocably waives this condition to Closing if not satisfied by the Closing, and shall otherwise be governed by the covenants and obligations set forth in Section 8.2.
 
 
 
 
 
The obligations of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions, which may be waived by Seller:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided that if this condition is not satisfied by the Closing, then the purchase and sale of the Shares of NewAusCo shall not be completed on the Closing Date, but shall be completed on the second Business Day following the date that paragraph (i) or (ii) of this condition shall have occurred, and Seller hereby irrevocably waives this condition to Closing if not satisfied by the Closing, and shall otherwise be governed by the covenants and obligations set forth in Section 8.2.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other than as specifically contemplated in this Agreement, the consummation and closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Closing") shall take place at the offices of Goodmans LLP, 250 Yonge Street, Suite 2400, M5B 2M6, or such other location as Buyer and Seller agree upon, on the Closing Date. The consummation and closing of the transactions contemplated in Section 2.1 shall take place on or before Closing at:
 
 
 
 
At Closing and, in the case of the transfer of the Shares of New AusCo, upon completion of such transfer, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At Closing, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller or such of Seller's Affiliates as Seller shall direct the following:
 
 
 
 
As soon as reasonably practicable following Closing, Seller shall, for no additional consideration, cause each of the Existing Holding Subsidiaries to convey to the New Holding Subsidiaries or Buyer, as the case may be, free and clear of all Encumbrances created by, through or under the Existing Holding Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Encumbrances, all
 
right, title and interest of the Existing Holding Subsidiaries in and to such Assets that have not already been conveyed to the New Holding Subsidiaries or the Buyer on or before the Closing, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 2.1 and 2.2 (the "Non-Transferred Assets"), whether the failure to convey such Assets occurs inadvertently or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the New Holding Subsidiaries to, accept the conveyance of the Non-Transferred Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller's obligation to convey the Non-Transferred Assets to Buyer and to complete all recording of instruments and associated filings with Governmental Authorities in respect of the Non-Transferred Assets pursuant to Section 5.5 shall survive Closing indefinitely until the time such transfer has been completed. Until completed, Seller shall hold the benefit of ownership of, and rights and interest in, the Non-Transferred Assets for the benefit of Buyer or the applicable New Holding Subsidiary, and shall promptly remit to Buyer or the applicable New Holding Subsidiary any amounts paid or received, or payable and receivable, in respect of such Assets, if received by Seller after the Closing Date.
 
As soon as reasonably practicable following Closing (unless completed at the Closing) and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(e) and Section 6.2(e), Seller shall, for no additional consideration, cause the Shares of NewAusCo to be transferred to Buyer as contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligation to convey the shares of NewAusCo to Buyer shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1, survive Closing until the time such transfer has been completed. Until completed, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall hold the benefit of ownership of, and rights and interest in, the Shares of NewAusCo for the benefit of Buyer, and each of Seller and Buyer covenant to make all remittances in respect of the Assets of NewAusCo in accordance with Section 2.6 as soon as reasonably practicable following the transfer of the Shares of NewAusco to Buyer; provided however, that if the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(e) and 6.2(e) shall have not been satisfied on or before March 31, 2008, then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a transaction structure pursuant to which the conditions in Sections 6.1(e) and 6.2(e) would be satisfied and, if Seller or Buyer, acting in good faith, determines that no such agreement can be reached, (i) Seller shall be deemed to no longer hold such shares for the benefit of Buyer; (ii) Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to US$31.8 million, which amount shall represent a reduction of the Purchase Price equal to the value of the Shares of NewAusCo and (iii) Seller shall have no additional obligations in respect of the transfer of the NewAusCo Shares under this Agreement. The foregoing represents Buyer's and Seller's sole remedies in the event that the conditions in Sections 6.1(e) and 6.2(e), respectively, are not satisfied.
 
Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller will afford each other, and their respective advisors, during normal business hours, reasonable access to, in the case of the Seller, any of the Excluded Books and Records and, in the case of Buyer, the Books and Records, in its possession with respect to periods through the Closing and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom to the extent that such access may be reasonably required by the requesting party, including without limitation in connection with (i) the preparation of Tax Returns or financial statements, (ii) any Tax audit, Tax protest or other proceeding relating to Taxes, (iii) the
 
determination or enforcement of rights and obligations under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) compliance with the requirements of any Governmental Authority, (v) any actual or threatened lawsuit, legal proceeding, administrative enforcement proceeding or arbitration before any Governmental Authority or (v) for purposes of determining and/or verifying the amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.6.
 
This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:
 
 
 
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, all obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except for the obligations in Section 5.1, this Section 9.2 and Article 11.
 
From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective officers and directors, employees, agents, and representatives, and any Person claiming by or through any of them, as the case may be, from and against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:
 
 
 
From and after Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers and directors, employees, agents, and representatives, and any Person claiming by or through any of them, as the case may be, from and against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnitee") of written notice of the assertion or the commencement of any Litigation with respect to any matter referred to in Sections 10.1 or 10.2, the Indemnitee shall give written notice thereof to Seller if the Indemnitee is a Person entitled to indemnification under Section 10.1, or Buyer, if the Indemnitee is a Person entitled to indemnification under Section 10.2 (in either case, the "Indemnitor"), and thereafter shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto; provided, however, that failure of the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.

Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receiving notice of commencement of any claim, action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this section, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it may have otherwise under this section, except to the extent that the party from whom contribution may be sought is materially prejudiced by such omission. The right to contribution provided herein shall be in addition and not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the Underwriters may have by statute or otherwise by law.

Exhibit 99.3
News Release
NEWMONT SELLS ROYALTY AND OTHER NON-CORE ASSETS VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION TO FRANCO-NEVADA
Expects to record pre-tax gain of approximately $900 million in fourth quarter
DENVER, Colorado, December 20, 2007  Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) confirmed today that it has sold its royalty assets and certain other non-core investments to Franco-Nevada Corporation in a transaction valued at approximately $1.3 billion (assuming a 20 day average US dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate of 0.996). The sale marks the culmination of the process announced earlier this year by Newmont to monetize components of its royalty and equity portfolio. Based on the current Canadian dollar exchange rate, Newmont now expects to record a pre-tax gain from discontinued operations of approximately $900 million in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale.
Richard O'Brien, Newmont's President and CEO, said, "We are extremely pleased with the outcome of the process that we announced earlier this year, which we believe has maximized the value of these assets for the benefit of our shareholders. The successful conclusion of this process on the timetable that we had originally established allows us to move into 2008 with the ability to devote our resources to the development of our core gold business."
