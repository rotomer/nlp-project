NEWS RELEASE [Logo Omitted] NEWMONT SELLS 5.3 MILLION EQUITY OUNCES OF GOLD IN 2007 AND EXPECTS COMPARABLE GOLD SALES IN 2008 DENVER, February 7, 2008 - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced 2007 operating and reserve results as well as the Company's operating outlook for 2008. For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported equity gold sales of 1.4 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $384 per ounce. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported equity gold sales of 5.3 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $406 per ounce. Consolidated capital expenditures for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 were $511 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, which were below the Company's original outlook of $1.8 to $2.0 billion for 2007. Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our operating results from the fourth quarter, resulting in gold sales performance consistent with our original expectations for the year. We expect our 2008 gold sales performance to be comparable with our 2007 results, with equity gold sales expected to be between 5.1 and 5.4 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $425 and $450 per ounce. Building on our strong operating performance from the third and fourth quarters of 2007, as well as the momentum we established with the completion of our Miramar acquisition and the sale of our royalty assets and certain other equity interests in December, we have embarked on 2008 with a renewed focus on operational and project execution as well as financial performance." Operating Q4 2007 Q4 2006 YTD 2007 YTD 2006 - ----------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Consolidated gold sales 1,648 1,954 6,184 7,186 (000 ounces) (1) Equity gold sales (000 1,405 1,715 5,321 5,870 ounces) (1), (2) Costs applicable to $ 384 $ 324 $ 406 $ 303 sales ($/ounce) (3) Capital expenditures $ 511 $ 440 $ 1,670 $ 1,537 ($ million) (1) Includes sales from start-up activities which are not included in Revenue, Costs applicable to sales per ounce and Depreciation, depletion and amortization per ounce calculations. (2) Includes sales from discontinued operations. (3) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and Midas redevelopment costs. 2007 EXPLORATION AND RESERVE RESULTS The Company reported year end 2007 proven and probable reserves of 86.5 million equity ounces compared with 93.9 million equity ounces at the end of 2006. As shown in the chart on the following page, during 2007 the Company added 4.2 million equity ounces of gold reserves due to margin changes and additional drilling. The gold price basis for the Company's reserve calculations increased to $575 per ounce in 2007 from $500 per ounce in 2006. Gold reserves were revised down at Ahafo in Ghana by 2.4 million equity ounces due to increasing operating and capital costs, by 0.8 million equity ounces at Nevada due to geotechnical and metallurgical changes, as well as higher operating costs, and by 0.2 million equity ounces at various locations due to operating cost inflation. Gold reserves were also impacted by 0.9 million ounces as a result of the previously announced reduction of the Company's economic ownership at Batu Hijau in Indonesia and by the sale of Pajingo in Australia. For 2007, the reserve additions from exploration of roughly 3.5 million equity ounces were primarily due to further extension drilling at Boddington, Jundee and Tanami in Australia, with 2.5 million equity ounces added to reserves in 2007, and the remaining additions coming from Batu Hijau, several open pit and underground sites in Nevada, and La Herradura in Mexico. NEWMONT - 2007 Operating and Reserve Results and 2008 Outlook (February 7, 2008) Page 1 of 10
2007 Reserve Reconciliation(1) [Bar Graph] Ounces (million) Actual 2006: 93.9 Margin Change: 0.7 Additions: 3.5 Depletion: 7.3 Divestments: 0.9 Revisions: 3.4 Actual 2007: 86.5 (1) For detailed information on the Company's year end reserves, please refer to the Supplemental Information in this release. For 2007, the Company's reserve grade remained relatively constant at 0.033 ounces per ton compared to 0.034 ounces per ton in 2006 in spite of downward pressure on grade due to both higher metal prices and the average depletion grade of 0.042 ounces per ton in 2007. The Company's reserves sensitivity to a $25 change in the gold price between $575 and $650 per ounce, assuming costs remain constant, is approximately 3.0 to 4.0 million equity ounces. The Company's ability to project reserve sensitivities at significantly higher gold prices is constrained by limited drill data. Looking to 2008, greenfield exploration will focus on the South America, North America and West Africa regions building on the encouraging results from these areas in 2007, as well as further non-reserve mineralization (NRM) conversion at Boddington. In South America, exploration will continue to focus on sulfide targets at Yanacocha in Peru and on greenfields projects in the Andes of Peru and the Guiana Shield, where the Company recently applied to the government of Suriname for a Right of Exploitation for the Merian II and Maraba discoveries at the Nassau joint venture. The Company expects to spend approximately $220 to $230 million on exploration activities in 2008, including approximately $29 million at the recently acquired Hope Bay project in Nunavut, Canada. Due to recent reserve replacement results, required changes to the Company's valuation model assumptions, primarily the discount rate, reserve growth rate, reserve finding costs, operating and capital costs, and new industry-developed interpretation of the accounting rules for impairment analysis, the Company will likely recognize a non-cash $1.1 billion Exploration Segment goodwill impairment as part of continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2007. 2008 OPERATING OUTLOOK In 2008, the Company expects equity gold sales of between 5.1 and 5.4 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $425 and $450 per ounce as continued industry-wide operating cost pressures are expected to be compounded by slightly lower gold grades. The Company continues to focus on cost mitigating initiatives, including this year's anticipated completion of the power plant in Nevada and commissioning of the gold mill at Yanacocha, as well as the implementation of operational diagnostic and continuous improvement measures at the Company's operations globally. NEWMONT - 2007 Operating and Reserve Results and 2008 Outlook (February 7, 2008) Page 2 of 10
The Company expects to realize cost savings in Nevada of approximately $25 per ounce annually from its Nevada power plant investment that is expected to be commissioned by mid-2008. The Company's 2008 costs applicable to sales outlook is subject to impact by changes to commodity prices and exchange rates. The Company's 2008 costs applicable to sales outlook assumed an oil price of $80 per barrel and an Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.875. During 2008, the Company anticipates consuming approximately 3 million barrels of oil. Additionally, the Company expects to spend approximately 20% of its total costs applicable to sales denominated in Australian dollars. The section below outlines the regional equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales per ounce outlook for 2008. Nevada, United States Equity gold sales in Nevada are expected to remain relatively stable in 2008 at approximately 2.27 to 2.40 million ounces, primarily due to increased leach production at Twin Creeks as well as Leeville operating at designed capacity for a complete year, offset by lower production from the closure of the Lone Tree processing facility. Costs applicable to sales in Nevada are expected to be slightly lower in 2008 at approximately $400 to $430 per ounce, partially due to anticipated cost savings of approximately $25 per ounce realized from the power plant and reduced milling costs due to the closure of the Lone Tree processing facility. The Company continues to address the operational challenges at Phoenix. The new crusher is expected to be completed and operational in the second quarter of 2008, and the new mine plan remains on schedule to be completed by mid-2008. Yanacocha, Peru Equity gold sales at Yanacocha are expected to increase slightly to between 885,000 and 925,000 ounces in 2008, primarily due to increased recoveries as the gold mill begins to process higher-grade ore in the first half of 2008. Costs applicable to sales at Yanacocha are expected to increase slightly in 2008 to between $370 and $390 per ounce, primarily due to a change in the mine sequence that resulted in increased waste stripping as well as higher labor costs from increased salaries and royalty payments. Australia/New Zealand Equity gold sales in Australia/New Zealand are expected to decrease to between 1.06 and 1.12 million ounces in 2008, as the impact of the Pajingo sale and lower grades at Tanami are partially offset by higher throughput at Waihi in New Zealand. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2008 in Australia/New Zealand to between $585 and $625 per ounce, primarily driven by slightly lower production, increasing consumable costs, and the higher assumed Australian dollar exchange rate. The Company has initiated an Australian dollar hedging program to reduce exchange rate volatility in operating costs going forward. Batu Hijau, Indonesia Equity gold and copper sales at Batu Hijau are expected to decrease to between 150,000 and 165,000 ounces of gold and to between 155 and 165 million pounds of copper in 2008, as mining shifts from the high grade bottom of the pit into a lower grade mine sequence during 2008 and a portion of 2009. The planned sequencing is expected to result in lower recoveries as lower grade stockpile ore is fed to the mill. Costs applicable to sales at Batu Hijau are expected to increase in 2008 to between $285 and $325 per ounce of gold and to between $1.30 and $1.40 per pound of copper, primarily driven by lower production and increased operating costs as the number of truck operating hours are expected to increase during the year, with associated increases in diesel, tires, and maintenance costs, offset by the benefit of building stockpiles in the second half of 2008. NEWMONT - 2007 Operating and Reserve Results and 2008 Outlook (February 7, 2008) Page 3 of 10
Ahafo, Ghana Equity gold sales at Ahafo are expected to increase to between 495,000 and 530,000 ounces in 2008, primarily due to higher grades and increased mill throughput, offset by lower recoveries due to the metallurgical characteristics of the ore processed in the mill. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase to between $485 and $520 per ounce in 2008, primarily as a result of expected higher labor and contracted service costs, as well as rising fuel and consumables prices and an increase in the tariff on electricity. 2008 CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL OUTLOOK The Company anticipates consolidated capital expenditures of between $1.8 and $2.0 billion in 2008 (between $1.6 and $1.8 billion on an equity basis), with approximately 50% invested in Australia/New Zealand, 25% in Nevada and the remaining 25% at other locations. Approximately $0.9 to $1.0 billion of the 2008 capital is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining $0.9 to $1.0 billion allocated to project development initiatives, including the completion of the Boddington project in Australia, the power plant in Nevada, and the gold mill in Peru. For 2008, consolidated capital expenditures in Nevada are expected to decrease to between $350 and $400 million, with spending focused primarily on the completion of the power plant, Phoenix crusher and other sustaining development. Consolidated capital expenditures in South America are expected to decrease to approximately $250 to $290 million in 2008 ($125 - $150 million on an equity basis), primarily as a result of completing the gold mill during the first half of 2008 and leach pad expansions. The Company continues to evaluate the optimal development plan for Conga, with a development decision expected in 2008. For 2008, consolidated capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand are expected to increase to approximately $800 to $850 million, primarily as a result of increased spending on the Boddington project. The Company completed its definitive estimate to update the Boddington capital costs and has revised its expected share of total costs on the project to between $1.4 and $1.6 billion, up from $0.9 to $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of the adverse impact of the Australian dollar exchange rate, design optimization, and labor and commodity cost escalation. The Company continues to expect Boddington to start up in late 2008 or early 2009. Consolidated capital expenditures in 2008 at Batu Hijau are expected to increase to between $145 and $195 million ($65 - $90 million on an equity basis) due to increased sustaining capital and initial feasibility spending on the third SAG mill expansion and pit dewatering infrastructure. Consolidated capital expenditures in Ghana are expected to be approximately $150 to $155 million, primarily related to spending on Ahafo expansion options as well as continued development studies on Akyem, with a development decision expected in 2008. For 2008, consolidated capital expenditures at the Hope Bay project in Nunavut are expected to be approximately $30 million, primarily focused on development phase enhancement of infrastructure.
