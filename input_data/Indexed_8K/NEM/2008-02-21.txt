News Release [GRAPHIC OMITTED] NEWMONT REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2007 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS DENVER, February 21, 2008 - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced fourth quarter and 2007 financial and operating results. For the quarter and year ended December 31, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $933 million (-$2.06 per share) and $963 million (-$2.13 per share), respectively, in 2007, compared with net income from continuing operations of $171 million ($0.38 per share) and $563 million ($1.25 per share), respectively, in 2006. Including discontinued operations, the Company reported a net loss of $289 million (-$0.63 per share) and $1.9 billion (-$4.17 per share), for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, compared with net income of $223 million ($0.50 per share) and $791 million ($1.76 per share) for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. Net income was impacted by the following: Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our operating results in each of our regions continue to improve, with fourth quarter and 2007 performance reflecting our focus on execution and in line with guidance. As we look to 2008 and beyond, we will maintain the momentum established in 2007 by further improving our operating performance through production, cost and capital execution in line with our plans. We will also focus on completing the construction of Boddington in Australia, the Yanacocha gold mill in Peru, and the Nevada power plant, while aggressively exploring at our recently acquired Hope Bay project in Canada." (1) Includes sales from start-up activities which are not included in Revenue, Costs applicable to sales and Depreciation, depletion and amortization per ounce calculations. (2) Includes sales from discontinued operations. (3) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and Midas redevelopment. NEWMONT - Fourth Quarter and 2007 Financial and Operating Results (February 21, 2008) Page 1 of 20
The Company generated net cash from continuing operations of $631 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $403 million in the year ago quarter. The Company generated net cash from continuing operations of $525 million in 2007, compared to $1.1 billion in 2006. Cash flow from continuing operations during 2007 was negatively impacted by the settlement of the price-capped forward sales contracts ($578 million), the settlement of pre-acquisition income taxes of Normandy ($276 million) and the final settlement of copper collar contracts ($174 million). During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a $1.1 billion non-cash Exploration Segment goodwill impairment as part of continuing operations, primarily due to recent reserve replacement results, required changes to the Company's valuation model assumptions (primarily the discount rate, reserve growth rate, reserve finding costs, operating and capital costs) and new industry-developed interpretation of the accounting rules for impairment analysis. In December 2007, the Company closed the sale of its royalty portfolio and other non-core assets to Franco-Nevada Corporation for cash consideration of approximately $1.2 billion, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.9 billion ($0.6 billion after-tax). The Company also completed the sale of its Pajingo mine for $23 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $8 million ($5 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a result, Pajingo's results for 2007 and 2006 were reclassified to discontinued operations. On January 18, 2008, the Company announced the successful completion of its offer to acquire a controlling interest in Miramar Mining Corporation. This transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOURTH QUARTER AND 2007 REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEVADA Q4 2007 Q4 2006 2007 2006 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Consolidated gold sales (000 ounces) (1) 667 887 2,341 2,534 Equity gold sales (000 ounces) (1) 667 887 2,341 2,427 Costs applicable to sales ($/ounce) (2) $ 384 $ 363 $ 444 $ 403 Capital expenditures ($ million) $ 135 $ 204 $ 588 $ 705 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Includes sales from start-up activities which are not included in Revenue, Costs applicable to sales and Depreciation, depletion and amortization per ounce calculations. (2) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts, and Midas redevelopment. Nevada Operating Performance Equity gold sales in Nevada decreased in the fourth quarter to 667,000 ounces from 887,000 ounces in the year ago quarter primarily due to lower mill grades at Carlin and Twin Creeks, limited mining activities at Midas following the suspension of operations in June 2007, higher in-process inventories at year-end and limited production from Lone Tree due to the completion of mining, partially offset by increased production at Leeville. In November 2007, Leeville achieved its design capacity of 3,200 tons per day, completing Leeville's planned ramp-up to steady-state production. On October 11, 2007, the Mine Safety and Health Administration lifted the restrictive order that required Midas to halt mining activities in June 2007. As a result, the Company has been completing redevelopment work at the mine, with ramp-up in the first quarter of 2008 nearing historical production levels. Open pit ore mined decreased 20% to 10.4 million tons in the fourth quarter of 2007, down from 13.0 million tons in the year ago quarter, primarily due to fewer tons mined at Gold Quarry and increased waste stripping at Phoenix. Underground ore mined decreased 10% in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to the completion of mining at Carlin East and reduced mining activities at Midas. Ore milled increased 6% to 6.9 million tons from 6.5 million tons in the year ago quarter, while milled ore grade decreased 14% during the same period, both driven by the processing of lower grade ore at Phoenix. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 19% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry and the completion of mining at Lone Tree. Mine sequencing at Gold Quarry also contributed to the 9% increase in leach ore grade from the year ago quarter. Total costs applicable to sales decreased 19% in the fourth quarter to $255 million from $316 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the completion of mining at Lone Tree and Carlin East. Total costs applicable to sales also decreased because fewer in-process and finished goods inventories were sold during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the year ago quarter. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 6% in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $384 from $363 in the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower production, higher cost production at Phoenix, and reduced mining activities at the lower-cost Midas mine following the suspension of operations. NEWMONT - Fourth Quarter and 2007 Financial and Operating Results (February 21, 2008) Page 2 of 20
Phoenix Update The focus at Phoenix during the fourth quarter was continued progress on optimization projects. The in-fill drill program was increased from 183 to 222 planned drill holes as actual drilling costs were lower than budget. Approximately 80% of the planned drill footage was complete as of December 31, 2007. Favorable results were realized through the implementation of continuous improvement projects, with an emphasis on human resources, equipment productivity and other cost reductions. Mill capacity utilization also improved with nearly 1 million tons processed in each month of the quarter compared to roughly 900,000 tons in the third quarter of 2007. Additionally, the new crusher remains on schedule for start-up by mid-2008 and was approximately 42% complete at the end of the fourth quarter. Phoenix sold 48,700 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $691 per ounce and 181,400 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $729 per ounce for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. The Company continues to expect an updated optimization plan for Phoenix by mid-2008. Nevada Capital Projects Capital expenditures in Nevada were $135 million and $588 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. Construction of the 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant was approximately 95% complete at the end of the fourth quarter and remains on schedule for completion in the first half of 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the power plant successfully achieved its first fire on oil and in January 2008 the plant achieved first fire on coal. Capital costs are expected to be in line with the previous outlook of between $620 and $640 million. As disclosed previously, the lower cost of self-generated electricity, when compared with projected future market prices in the region, is expected to reduce Nevada's costs applicable to sales by approximately $25 per ounce. (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Yanacocha Operating Performance Equity gold sales at Yanacocha in the fourth quarter were consistent with the year ago quarter at approximately 438,000 ounces with slightly higher gold production offset by an increase in finished goods inventory. Ore mined increased 37% to 32.7 million tons from 23.9 million tons and leach ore grade increased by 31% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the year ago quarter. Costs applicable to sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $315 per ounce from $244 per ounce in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher labor, diesel, and other commodity prices, as well as higher worker's participation bonuses and royalties due to increased gold prices. Yanacocha Capital Projects Consolidated capital expenditures at Yanacocha were $72 million and $253 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. Progress on the gold mill continued as expected, with construction approximately 96% complete at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Major milestones during the quarter included completing the primary crusher and the stockpile feed system, and beginning pre-commissioning activities. The Company continues to anticipate commercial production in the first half of 2008. Capital costs on the project are expected to remain in line with the outlook of between $250 and $270 million. Once complete, the gold mill is expected to enhance recovery of complex ores, improve financial returns and extend the operating life at Yanacocha.

(1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Australia/New Zealand Operating Performance Australia/New Zealand sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 295,000 ounces from 289,000 ounces in the year ago quarter, primarily due to increased production at Jundee and Waihi, partially offset by decreased production at Tanami and Kalgoorlie. Gold sales at Jundee increased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 55% increase in mill ore grades and a 3% increase in mill recoveries, partially offset by a 31% decrease in mill throughput. Gold sales at Waihi increased 55% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 2006, primarily due to a 48% increase in mill throughput, partially offset by a 23% decrease in ore grade resulting from mining a higher proportion of open pit ore. Gold sales at Tanami decreased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 2006, primarily due to a 20% decrease in milled ore grade from the blending of low grade stockpiles and a 9% decrease in throughput. Gold sales at Kalgoorlie in the fourth quarter of 2007 were comparable to the year ago quarter primarily due to slightly lower throughput and 11% lower mill ore grade, partially offset by the timing of gold sales and a 2% increase in recovery rates. Costs applicable to sales increased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $494 per ounce from $409 per ounce in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the strengthening Australian and New Zealand dollar exchange rates, which increased unit costs by approximately $58 per ounce compared to the year ago quarter. Additionally, royalties increased due to higher gold prices, and input costs were higher, particularly related to fuel, electricity and labor. The following quarter-on-quarter costs applicable to sales variances include the impact of the strengthening Australian and New Zealand dollars. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% at Jundee to $416 per ounce from $374 per ounce, primarily due to higher contract mining and electricity costs. At Waihi, costs applicable to sales increased 30% to $445 per ounce from $343 per ounce primarily due to increased ore re-handling costs and milling costs from higher mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales at Kalgoorlie increased 25% to $673 per ounce from $539 per ounce, primarily due to higher mining costs from sound abatement and increased equipment maintenance. At Tanami, costs applicable to sales increased 24% to $445 per ounce from $360 per ounce, primarily due to lower production. Australia/New Zealand Capital Projects Capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand were $229 million and $597 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. Development of the Boddington project was approximately 62% complete at the end of 2007, with mill start-up expected in late 2008 or early 2009. The Company completed its definitive estimate to update the Boddington capital costs and has revised its expected share of total costs on the project to between $1.4 and $1.6 billion, up from $0.9 to $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of the adverse impact of the Australian dollar exchange rate, design optimization, and labor and commodity cost escalation.

(1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Batu Hijau Operating Performance Equity gold and copper sales decreased in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 54,000 ounces and 34 million pounds, respectively, from 89,000 ounces and 78 million pounds, respectively, in the year ago quarter. Ore tons mined decreased 78% in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago quarter primarily due to mine sequencing in the pit. Lower gold and copper production compared to the year ago quarter was primarily due to a 20% decrease in throughput as a result of unplanned mill downtime in the fourth quarter of 2007, and lower gold and copper recoveries due to a higher ratio of acid-soluble copper content, partially offset by 6% higher gold ore grades. The timing of sales also negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2007 as concentrate inventory at year-end increased compared to the year ago quarter. Total costs applicable to sales increased $15 million from the year ago quarter, primarily due to fewer ore tons mined and stockpiled, resulting in a higher portion of mining costs charged in the current year quarter. Additionally, the average waste-to-ore ratio increased compared to the year ago quarter, partially offset by lower fuel costs as a result of fewer operating hours. Costs applicable to sales per unit increased 84% per ounce of gold and 102% per pound of copper in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 2006, primarily due to decreased sales compared to the year ago quarter. Additionally, a higher proportion of costs were allocated to gold than copper due to the higher proportion of gold revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the year ago quarter. The average realized copper price, after treatment and refining charges, decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $1.57 per pound from $1.63 per pound in the year ago quarter. Although copper sales were completely unhedged in the fourth quarter of 2007, the decline in copper prices during the fourth quarter of 2007 reduced the Company's provisional pricing market-to-market on third quarter sales revenue by $119 million. This provisional pricing mark-to-market adjustment lowered the average realized price in the fourth quarter of 2007 by approximately $1.54 per pound. (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Ahafo Operating Performance Gold ounces sold at Ahafo decreased 32% in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 85,000 ounces from 125,000 ounces in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a 25% decrease in mill throughput as a result of unplanned downtime in December 2007 and the processing of 12% lower mill ore grades, partially offset by a 4% increase in recovery rates. Both total tons and ore tons mined decreased compared to the year ago quarter as a result of longer haul distances as pits deepen and increased waste stripping at the Apensu pit. Costs applicable to sales at Ahafo increased 28% to $416 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $326 per ounce in the year ago quarter, primarily due to fewer ounces sold and increased mining and milling costs. Mining costs increased due to higher waste removal costs, as well as the year ago quarter benefiting from the capitalization of pre-production costs and lower maintenance costs. Mining costs also increased due to increased pit dewatering, labor, fuel and tire costs. Milling costs increased compared to the year ago quarter primarily due to increased maintenance costs as the new mill required minimal maintenance in the year ago quarter.

(1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization and loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. Other Operations Performance Equity gold sales for the Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia and the La Herradura mine in Mexico decreased slightly to 40,000 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 42,000 ounces in the year ago quarter. Equity gold sales at Kori Kollo decreased 22% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 2006, primarily due to the timing of production flow from the leach pads. La Herradura gold production was slightly lower in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the year ago quarter, however, gold sales increased 22%, primarily due to the timing of sales in the year ago quarter. Costs applicable to sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $338 per ounce from $272 per ounce in the year ago quarter. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 17% at Kori Kollo in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to lower mining costs from a reduction in waste removal costs and increased ore tons mined in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the year ago quarter. Costs applicable to sales increased 66% at La Herradura, primarily due to increased waste removal costs. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL, TAX RATE AND OTHER - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $511 million, primarily for the construction of the power plant and sustaining mine development in Nevada ($135 million), construction of the gold mill and leach pad expansions at Yanacocha in Peru ($72 million), construction of the Boddington project and other sustaining mine development in Australia/New Zealand ($229 million), as well as sustaining mine development at Ahafo in Ghana ($35 million). The Company expensed $163 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company incurred $38 million of general and administrative expenses and net interest expense of $28 million during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company incurred $17 million and $45 million of advanced projects, research and development and exploration expenditures, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2007. The effective tax rate on the (loss) income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was (-11%) compared to 23% in the year ago quarter. Excluding the $1.1 billion Exploration Segment goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of 2007, which is not deductible for tax purposes, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 would have been 26%. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2008 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL OUTLOOK ($ MILLIONS, EXCEPT TAX RATE) 2008 Outlook - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Depreciation, depletion & amortization $725 - $775 Exploration $220 - $230 Advanced projects, research and development $120 - $180 General and administrative $140 - $150 Interest expense, net $110 - $120 Effective tax rate 30% - 34% - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEWMONT - Fourth Quarter and 2007 Financial and Operating Results (February 21, 2008) Page 6 of 20
