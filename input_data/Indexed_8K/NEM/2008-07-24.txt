NEWS RELEASE [NEWMONT LOGO] NEWMONT'S SECOND QUARTER ADJUSTED NET INCOME(1) RISES TO $230 MILLION ($0.51 PER SHARE); NEVADA POWER PLANT AND YANACOCHA GOLD MILL IN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION This release should be read in conjunction with Newmont's Second Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24, 2008 (available at www.newmont.com). DENVER, July 24, 2008 - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) today announced second quarter results, with gold sales of 1.27 million equity ounces at an average realized gold price of $900 per ounce and costs applicable to sales of $440 per ounce, resulting in Adjusted net income(1) of $230 million ($0.51 per share), compared to Adjusted net income(1) of $103 million ($0.23 per share) in the year ago quarter. Net income on a GAAP basis was $277 million ($0.61 per share) during the second quarter, compared with a net loss of $2.1 billion (-$4.57 per share) in the year ago quarter. Second Quarter 2008 Highlights: >> Adjusted net income(1) increased 123% to $230 million ($0.51 per share) from $103 million ($0.23 per share) in the year ago quarter; >> Adjusted net cash provided from continuing operations(1) increased 87% to $382 million ($0.84 per share) from $204 million ($0.45 per share) in the year ago quarter; >> Costs applicable to sales((2)) were $440 per ounce compared to $417 per ounce in the year ago quarter; >> Revenues increased 19% from the year ago quarter to $1.5 billion at an average realized gold price of $900 per ounce, compared with an average realized gold price of $665 per ounce in the year ago quarter; >> The Yanacocha gold mill and Nevada power plant began commercial production, with both projects successfully completed on or ahead of schedule and at or below forecasted costs; and >> Realized tax benefit(3) of $129 million, net, resulting in a lower expected 2008 tax rate of between 22% and 26%. Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our continued focus on cost control and operational execution has produced another quarter of strong results that are in-line with our plans, despite the industry-wide challenge of escalating operating and capital costs. Our capital project execution also continues to improve, as both the Yanacocha gold mill and the Nevada power plant were completed on or ahead of schedule and at or below forecasted costs. By leveraging our global resources, experience, and strategic partnerships, we were able to successfully complete our projects and transition from project development to commercial production in a challenging construction environment." The Company is maintaining its initial 2008 annual equity gold sales guidance at between 5.1 and 5.4 million ounces and its initial costs applicable to sales guidance of between $425 and $450 per ounce. The Company's costs applicable to sales forecast for 2008 now assumes an oil price of $125 per barrel and an Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.95 for the balance of the year. Costs applicable to sales are expected to change by approximately $4 per ounce for every $10 change in the oil price and by roughly $3 per ounce for every 0.10 change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the remainder of the year. As of June 30, 2008, the Company had hedged approximately 44% of the remaining 2008 forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating costs at an average exchange rate of 0.87. Additionally, the Company's cash distributions from its holdings in the Canadian Oil Sands Trust are currently expected to offset approximately 25% of the Company's oil exposure.

(2) Excludes Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts, Amortization and Accretion. (3) Details of the realized tax benefit are outlined in the Consolidated Financial Results section of the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at . NEWMONT - Second Quarter 2008 Operating and Page 1 of 10 Financial Results (July 24, 2008)
REGIONAL OPERATIONS In the second quarter of 2008, the Company reported equity gold sales of 1.27 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $440 per ounce. The Company's operations delivered equity gold sales slightly above management's expectations during the second quarter, as higher than expected equity sales in the Australia/New Zealand region and at Ahafo offset lower than expected equity sales at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha. The Company's second quarter costs applicable to sales per ounce were impacted by higher than expected costs at Nevada, Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, offset by lower than expected costs in the Australia/New Zealand region and at Ahafo. Nevada - Nevada sold 554,000 equity ounces at costs applicable to sales of $430 per ounce during the second quarter. Equity sales were in-line with expectations, as stockpiled inventory reductions offset production shortfalls from the unplanned shut-down of the third party operated Getchell mine and the Yukon-Nevada Gold processing facility. Gold production was slightly lower than plan due to the timing of ore recoveries from the Twin Creeks leach pads. The Company expects this production to be realized during the second half of this year. Costs applicable to sales during the second quarter were in-line with expectations, as higher than expected mining costs from processing higher-cost stockpile inventory as well as higher fuel and underground contract services were offset by higher by-product credits. Phoenix Revised Plan - Phoenix sold 54,100 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $361 per ounce during the second quarter, compared to 39,700 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $844 per ounce in the year ago quarter. The cost improvements were driven by increased copper and silver by-product credits and increased mill throughput. The Company has spent the past year completing studies at Phoenix, focused on resolving issues with gold grade reconciliation, complex copper mineralogy, rock hardness, and operating and design inefficiencies. The Company has completed an extensive re-drilling program and has incorporated the results into a new mine plan that more accurately defines the ore body. Based on the updated mine plan and current commodity price assumptions, equity gold production during the next five-years is currently expected to average approximately 200,000 to 250,000 ounces per annum at costs applicable to sales of approximately $400 to $500 per ounce, net of by-product credits. The Company will continue to focus on productivity and cost improvements, process optimization opportunities, and near mine exploration. Commercial Operation at Nevada Power Plant - The 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant achieved commercial production on May 1, 2008. The Company expects to save approximately $70 to $80 million per year in costs applicable to sales from the lower cost of self-generated electricity, compared to purchasing power in the current market. Capital costs for the power plant are expected to be approximately $620 million, at the low-end of previous guidance of $620 to $640 million. Yanacocha - Equity gold sales during the second quarter at Yanacocha in Peru were 222,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $374 per ounce. Equity sales were slightly below expectations, as marginally lower production was offset by inventory reductions. Leach placement at the end of the second quarter was ahead of plan due to a change in mine sequence, with slightly higher production anticipated during the second half of 2008. Commercial Operation at Gold Mill - The gold mill achieved commercial production on April 1, 2008. Production from the mill contributed approximately 40,000 ounces to equity gold sales during the second quarter, with mill ramp-up exceeding expectations. During the first five years of operation, the design throughput is expected to be approximately 5 million tons per annum with gold and silver recoveries averaging between 75% and 85% and between 60% and 75%, respectively. Equity gold production from the mill is currently expected to average approximately 200,000 to 250,000 ounces per annum at costs applicable to sales of approximately $250 to $320 per ounce. Capital costs are expected to be approximately $230 million, below previous guidance of $250 to $270 million. Australia/New Zealand - Equity gold sales in Australia/New Zealand were 301,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $565 per ounce. Equity gold sales exceeded expectations due to higher grades at Jundee and Tanami, more than offseting lower than planned production at Kalgoorlie. Australia/New Zealand costs applicable to sales are expected to change by roughly $13 per ounce for every 0.10 change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the remainder of the year. NEWMONT - Second Quarter 2008 Operating and Page 2 of 10 Financial Results (July 24, 2008)
Batu Hijau - Equity gold and copper sales at Batu Hijau in Indonesia were 17,000 ounces and 23 million pounds, respectively, at costs applicable to sales of $518 per ounce and $2.02 per pound, respectively. Sales were below expectations due to reduced production from lower throughput and recovery. The de-watering program, developed to address the significant rainfall during the first quarter, has yielded better than expected results and may contribute to increased production during the dry season in the second half of the year, potentially offsetting portions of the second quarter shortfall. Total costs applicable to sales were consistent with expectations, with higher unit costs largely driven by lower sales volume during the second quarter. Ahafo - Equity gold sales at Ahafo in Ghana were 134,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $390 per ounce. Equity gold sales were in-line with plan, as higher than expected ore grades from the Subika and Apensu pits and inventory sales were offset by lower than expected throughput. The Company has revised its expected costs applicable to sales guidance at Ahafo to between $450 and $500 per ounce, compared to original guidance of between $485 and $520 per ounce. The revised guidance is primarily driven by greater than expected capitalization of the cost of waste rock placed for the construction of tails and other facilities, lower than expected power costs, as higher than anticipated power was available from the Volta River Authority (VRA), and lower than anticipated labor costs. These favorable variances are partially offset by the rate increase for power supplied by the VRA starting on July 1, 2008. The Company continues to negotiate the price per kilowatt hour with the VRA; however, the Company has included in its revised guidance a potential increase to 2008 costs applicable to sales of approximately $15 to $30 per ounce for power. Regional operating variances from the year ago quarter, as disclosed in the Company's previous earnings releases, are outlined in the Results of Consolidated Operations section of the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.newmont.com. CAPITAL UPDATE Consolidated capital expenditures were $448 million during the second quarter, with approximately 50% attributed to the Boddington project in Australia. The Company has updated its 2008 consolidated capital expenditure guidance to between $1.7 and $2.0 billion, compared to original guidance of between $1.8 and $2.0 billion, primarily due to the deferral of capital expenditures in Indonesia. Boddington - Development of the Boddington project in Australia was approximately 77% complete at the end of the second quarter, with start-up expected in late 2008 or early 2009. The Company's expected share of total capital costs of between $1.4 and $1.6 billion continues to be pressured by the strengthening Australian dollar and the industry-wide labor and commodity cost pressures. The Company will continue to monitor the impact of the strong Australian currency and other inflationary pressures on the capital cost estimate and will provide an update during its third quarter conference call. As of June 30, 2008, the Company has hedged approximately 63% of the remaining forecasted Australian dollar denominated capital costs at an average exchange rate of 0.90. Batu Hijau - The Company has deferred capital associated with a planned mill expansion due to the delay in the Indonesian government's renewal of the Company's forest use permit. The Company now expects capital expenditures of approximately $80 to $120 million, down from previous guidance of between $145 and $195 million. A detailed explanation of regional capital expenditures during the second quarter is outlined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.newmont.com.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Classification Reporting Changes - Certain amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. The Company reclassified the World Gold Council dues from General and administrative to Other expense, net, reclassified Accretion from Costs applicable to sales to a separate Accretion line item, reclassified regional administrative and community development from Costs applicable to sales to Other expense, net and reclassified marketing costs from Costs applicable to sales to General and administrative. The Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have also been reclassified for discontinued operations. These changes were reflected for all periods presented. Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net cash provided from continuing operations to GAAP Net Income and GAAP Net cash provided from (used in) operations, respectively - Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted net income and Adjusted net cash provided from continuing operations to evaluate the Company's operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income and Adjusted net cash provided from continuing operations allows investors and analysts to compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill. Management's determination of the components of Adjusted net income and Adjusted net cash provided from continuing operations are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Adjusted net income and Adjusted net cash provided from continuing operations are not, and should not be used as, alternatives to GAAP Net income and GAAP Net cash measures as reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Neither is a measure of financial performance under GAAP and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The tables below set forth a reconciliation of Adjusted net income to GAAP Net income and of Adjusted net cash provided from continuing operations to GAAP Net cash provided from (used in) continuing operations, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
