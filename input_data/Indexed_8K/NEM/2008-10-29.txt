Newmont Generates Third Quarter Net Cash From Continuing Operations of
$198 Million ($0.44 per Share); Maintains 2008 Guidance
This release should be read in conjunction with Newmonts Third Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 29, 2008 (available at
www.newmont.com
).
DENVER, October 29, 2008  Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM)
today announced third quarter results, with net cash from continuing operations of $198 million ($0.44 per share) on equity gold sales of 1.28 million ounces at an
 
average realized gold price of $865 per ounce. Costs applicable to sales were $480 per ounce, and adjusted net income
(1)
was $176 million ($0.39 per share). Net income on a GAAP basis was $196 million ($0.43 per share) during the third quarter.
Third Quarter 2008 Highlights:
Despite the current strains on global financial markets, Newmont remains well positioned with a strong balance sheet, a disciplined project review and execution process, and a continued focus on the daily operation of our business, said Richard OBrien, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Our focus on operational execution continues to yield positive results as we delivered the fifth straight quarter of solid performance in line with our plans. 
Mr. OBrien went on to add, We continue to advance our future cornerstone of the Asia-Pacific region, Boddington in Australia, towards a targeted start-up in early to mid-2009.  Building on the successful transition of the Yanacocha gold mill and Nevada power plant from projects to operations during the second quarter, we are confident in our ability to execute the successful completion of the Boddington project, which will become the largest gold mine in Australia and a strategic asset in our portfolio for years to come.
The Company is maintaining its initial 2008 annual equity gold sales guidance at between
5.1 and 5.4 million ounces
and its original costs applicable to sales guidance of between
$425 and $450 per ounce
. The Companys costs applicable to sales forecast for 2008 now assumes an oil price of $75 per barrel and an Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.75 for the balance of the year. Costs applicable to sales are expected to change by approximately $1 per ounce for every $10 change in the oil price and by roughly $1 per ounce for every 0.10 change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the remainder of the year.

Regional Operations
In the third quarter of 2008, the Company reported equity gold sales of
1.28 million
ounces at costs applicable to sales of
$480
per ounce. The Companys operations delivered equity gold sales slightly below managements expectations as lower than expected sales in Nevada and at Batu Hijau were partially offset by higher than expected sales in Australia and at Yanacocha. The Companys third quarter costs applicable to sales per ounce were impacted by higher than expected costs in Nevada, at Batu Hijau and at Kori Kollo, offset by lower than expected costs in Australia, at Yanacocha and at Ahafo.
Nevada
 
- Nevada sold
544,000
 
equity ounces
at costs applicable to sales of
$497
 
per ounce
during the third quarter. Equity sales were lower than expected primarily due to the continued suspension of operations at the third party operated Getchell mine and the Yukon-Nevada Gold processing facility, slower than anticipated recoveries from the Carlin South and Twin Creeks leach pads, and lower throughput at Midas. Costs applicable to sales per ounce during the third quarter were higher than expected due to lower than expected gold sales, continued high diesel and contracted services costs, and lower by-product credits due to lower copper prices and volumes, partially offset by a full quarter of commercial operation at the Nevada power plant. The Company now expects Nevada costs applicable to sales for 2008 to be between $410 and $440 per ounce, compared to previous guidance of $400 to $430 per ounce.
Yanacocha
- Equity gold sales during the third quarter at Yanacocha in Peru were
225,000
 
ounces
at costs applicable to sales of
$362
 
per ounce
. Equity sales were above expectations due to a change in mine sequence that resulted in more leach tons placed during the second quarter, which produced higher than anticipated ounces in the third quarter, partially offset by higher than anticipated finished goods inventory. In addition, gold sales were higher than expected as production from the gold mill exceeded expectations with throughput, grades and recoveries higher than expected. Yanacocha costs applicable to sales were lower than expected due to higher than expected gold sales, partially offset by higher workers participation and diesel costs, and lower silver by-product credits. With the gold mill performance and overall gold sales exceeding expectations through the third quarter, the Company is lowering its expected costs applicable to sales guidance for 2008 to between $350 and $370 per ounce from the previous range of between $370 and $390 per ounce.
Australia/New Zealand
- Equity gold sales during the third quarter in the Australia/New Zealand region were
312,000
 
ounces
at costs applicable to sales of
$570
 
per ounce
.
Equity gold sales continued to exceed expectations as higher grades and recoveries at Jundee, and higher throughput and recoveries at Waihi more than offset lower grades and recoveries at Kalgoorlie and Tanami, and lower grades at Waihi.
Australia/New Zealand regional costs applicable to sales were lower than expected due to higher sales at Jundee and a more favorable Australian dollar exchange rate during the quarter, partially offset by higher diesel and maintenance costs. Australia/New Zealand regional costs applicable to sales are expected to change by roughly $4 per ounce for every 0.10 change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the remainder of the year.
Batu Hijau
- Equity gold and copper sales during the third quarter at Batu Hijau in Indonesia were
12,000
 
ounces
and
20
 
million pounds
, respectively, at costs applicable to sales of
$718
 
per ounce
and
$1.98
 
per pound
, respectively. Equity gold and copper sales were lower than expected primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments that resulted in third quarter gold and copper production of 20,000 ounces and 11 million pounds, respectively, not being shipped during the third quarter. Equity gold and copper production was slightly lower than planned as throughput was lower than expected due to harder Phase 5 ore and limited access to Phase 4 ore caused by the extensive rainfall in the first half of 2008. Total costs applicable to sales were consistent with expectations, with higher unit costs largely driven by lower sales volume during the third quarter.
The Company estimates costs applicable to sales per unit increased by approximately $115 per ounce and $0.27 per pound due to the timing of shipments. With the increased unit costs during the third quarter and the recent decrease in the copper price relative to the gold price, which will likely result in a larger proportion of costs allocated to gold sales, the Company now expects gold costs applicable to sales guidance for 2008 to be slightly higher at between $360 and $400 per ounce compared to previous guidance of $340 to $380 per ounce. The Company continues to expect copper costs applicable to sales guidance for 2008 to be between $1.50 and $1.75 per pound.

Ahafo
- Equity gold sales during the third quarter at Ahafo in Ghana were
141,000
 
ounces
at costs applicable to sales of
$402
 
per ounce
. Equity gold sales were slightly higher than anticipated due to higher recoveries and the processing of higher grade material, partially offset by lower throughput. Power costs at Ahafo continued to be lower than anticipated due to higher availability of power from the Volta River Authority (VRA), partially offset by a rate increase for power supplied by the VRA that came into effect on July 1, 2008. As a result, the Company again lowered its costs applicable to sales guidance for 2008 at Ahafo to between $400 and $450 per ounce, compared to previous guidance of between $450 and $500 per ounce.
Regional operating variances from the year ago quarter, as disclosed in the Companys previous earnings releases, are outlined in the Results of Consolidated Operations section of the Companys Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at

.
Capital Update
Consolidated capital expenditures were $458 million during the third quarter, with nearly 50% attributed to the Boddington project in Australia. The Company is maintaining its 2008 consolidated capital expenditure guidance at between $1.7 and $2.0 billion.
Boddington
 
- Development of the Boddington project in Australia was approximately 85% complete at the end of the third quarter, with start-up expected in early to mid-2009.  After completing a detailed review of projected scope and cost to completion, the Company now expects its share of total capital costs to be between $1.7 and $1.9 billion primarily due to an approximate one quarter delay in the project schedule, a tightening Australian labor market and continued industry-wide commodity cost inflation.  Despite continued cost pressures, the Company remains confident in the plant design and 12 month ramp-up schedule. With equity gold and copper reserves at December 31, 2007 of 11.1 million ounces and 1.0 billion pounds, respectively, the deposit currently has an expected mine life in excess of 20 years. The Company continues to view Boddington as a cornerstone asset within its portfolio.

The Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have also been reclassified for discontinued operations.

Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income
-
Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Companys operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income
allows investors and analysts to
compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill. Managements determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.
Adjusted net income is not, and should not be used as, an alternative to GAAP Net income as reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted net income to GAAP Net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
