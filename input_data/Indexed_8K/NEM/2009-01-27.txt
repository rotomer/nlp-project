Newmont Announces Positive 2008 Operating Results, with Continuing Improvements Expected in 2009
DENVER, January 27, 2009  Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (Newmont or the Company) today announced 2008 equity gold sales of approximately 5.2 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $440 per ounce.  With the start-up of the Boddington project in Australia in mid-2009, the Company expects continued operating performance improvements in 2009, with an equity gold sales outlook of between 5.2 and 5.5 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $440 per ounce. The 2009 expectations assume ownership of 100% of the Boddington project, reflecting the expected completion of the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., announced earlier today.
Consolidated capital expenditures for 2008 were approximately $1.9 billion, consistent with the Companys original expectations for the year.  With completion of the power plant in Nevada and the gold mill in Peru in 2008, and completion of the Boddington project expected in mid-2009, consolidated capital expenditures are expected to decline to between $1.4 and $1.6 billion ($1.3 to $1.5 billion on an equity basis).
2008 Highlights:
Richard OBrien, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, We are pleased with the results of our initiatives to improve operating results, resulting in gold sales and costs applicable to sales performance consistent with our original expectations for the year.  We achieved our goal of delivering on our plans for this year.  For 2009, we expect equity gold sales to increase to between 5.2 and 5.5 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $440 per ounce, assuming the completion of the Boddington acquisition.
As a result of recent financial market volatility, the value of certain investments declined during the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax charge of approximately $159 million for non-cash write-downs of marketable securities and property, plant and mine development.  As of December 31, 2008, the Companys Canadian Oil Sands Trust investment was valued at $534 million.
 
 
 
 
Exploration and Reserve Results:
The Company reported year-end 2008 proven and probable gold reserves of 85.0 million equity ounces, compared with 86.5 million equity ounces at the end of 2007.  Year-end 2008 reserves would have been 91.6 million equity ounces, an increase of approximately 6% over year-end 2007, if the expected acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the Boddington project had occurred at the end of 2008.
In 2008 the Company added 6.3 million equity ounces of gold reserves due to margin changes and additional drilling, offset by revisions of 1.1 million equity ounces.  The assumed gold price for the Companys reserve calculations increased to $725 per ounce in 2008, from $575 per ounce in 2007.
 
 
For 2008, the majority of the reserve additions from exploration of roughly 4.4 million equity ounces came from the Boddington project, and Nevada and Mexico.  Gold reserves were revised downward at Phoenix in Nevada by 0.8 million ounces due to geological, modeling and metallurgical issues identified through the reconciliation process.
The Companys reserve sensitivities to a $50 change in gold price between $725 and $775 per ounce, assuming costs remain constant, is approximately 3.0 to 4.0 million equity ounces.  The Companys ability to project reserve sensitivities at significantly higher gold prices is constrained by limited drill data.
 
 
 
 
2009 Operating Outlook:
The Company expects higher equity gold sales of between 5.2 and 5.5 million ounces at lower costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $440 per ounce in 2009.  Higher gold sales are expected due to the start-up of Boddington, the anticipated 100% ownership of the Boddington project following the expected completion of the acquisition, as well as increased gold sales at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau.  These increases are expected to be partially offset by lower sales in Nevada.  Lower costs applicable to sales are expected due to the start-up of Boddington, higher expected gold sales from the lower cost Yanacocha and Batu Hijau operations, as well as lower oil price and Australian dollar exchange rate assumptions, partially offset by lower by-product copper price assumptions.  The following table sets out the Companys regional equity sales and costs applicable to sales outlook for 2009.
 
2009 Capital Expenditures Outlook:
The Company anticipates lower consolidated capital expenditures of between $1.4 and $1.6 billion in 2009 (between $1.3 and $1.5 billion on an equity basis), with approximately 60% invested in Australia/New Zealand, 15% in Nevada and the remaining 25% at other locations.  We anticipate that approximately 45% of the 2009 capital will be allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 55% allocated to project development initiatives, including the completion of the Boddington project in Australia.  The above ranges assume an economic interest of 100% in the Boddington project in Australia effective January 1, 2009.  The following table sets out the Companys regional capital expenditures outlook for 2009.
