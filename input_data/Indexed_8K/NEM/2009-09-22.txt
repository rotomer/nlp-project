Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 18 and 19, 2009, the Company's indirect affiliate PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara ("PTNNT") experienced a geotechnical failure in the west wall of the Batu Hijau open-pit mine in Indonesia. PTNNT has temporarily suspended operations in the Batu Hijau pit pending a geotechnical review and development of a plan for stabilizing the wall and recommencing mining operations. PTNNT continues to process lower-grade ore from stockpiles. It is too early to assess the impact on production and revenues and the Company will provide an update once it has a clear understanding of the impacts of the incident and related remediation on production for 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
