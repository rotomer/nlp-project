First Quarter 2010 Highlights:
With a 22% increase in our average realized gold price, our net gold operating margin expanded by 32% to $626 per ounce, further demonstrating our ability to provide significant gold price leverage through expanding cash operating margins, said Richard OBrien, President and Chief Executive Officer.  We also recently secured the mining lease for our Akyem project in Ghana and continue our dialogue with local communities and Ghanaian authorities. In addition, we are advancing our development plans at Conga in Peru following a successful public meeting with local stakeholders. The strength of our balance sheet coupled with the progress being made on our advanced development assets, Newmont is well positioned to invest in our project pipeline while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility.

Supplemental Information
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income
Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Companys operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations.  The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill.  Managements determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.
The table below sets forth a reconciliation of adjusted net income to GAAP net income, the directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
 
 
Reconciliation of Co-Product Costs Applicable to Sales to By-Product Costs Applicable to Sales
Sales and Costs applicable to sales for Boddington are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold and copper due to the significant portion of copper production (approximately 15-20% of total sales based on the latest life-of-mine plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a relative proportion of sales values for other costs. Management also assesses the performance of the Boddington mine on a by-product basis due to the majority of sales being derived from gold and to determine contingent consideration payments to AngloGold. The by-product method deducts copper sales from costs applicable to sales as shown in the following tables:
