DENVER, July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) ("Newmont" or the "Company") today announced second quarter adjusted net income(1) of $377 million ($0.77 per share) compared to $211 million ($0.43 per share) in the prior year quarter.  Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders was $382 million ($0.78 per share) compared to $162 million ($0.33 per share) in the second quarter of 2009.
In addition, Newmont announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's regular quarterly dividend from $0.10 per share of common stock to $0.15 per share of common stock, payable on September 29, 2010 to holders of record at the close of business on September 8, 2010.
Second Quarter 2010 Highlights:
"Today's announcement of a 50% increase of our regular quarterly dividend reflects the confidence we have in our ability to fully fund our project pipeline and exploration programs, keep the door open to value-creating acquisition opportunities and return capital to shareholders, which we feel positions us uniquely in the gold equity market and versus the ETF," said Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our portfolio continues to deliver despite operating costs being higher than expected during our ramp-up at Boddington, where we are experiencing lower gold grades than modeled.  As a result, we are maintaining our previously announced 2010 outlook for equity gold production of at a slightly narrower range of costs applicable to sales of between on a co-product basis."

The Company anticipates improving operating costs during the remainder of the year, with higher ore grades and lower stripping at Batu Hijau, as well as higher processing plant availability now that regularly scheduled second quarter mill maintenance at a key processing facility in Nevada is complete.
Our costs applicable to sales per ounce for the remainder of the year are expected to change by approximately $3 for every $10 change in the oil price and by approximately $3 for every $0.10 change in the A$ exchange rate, net of existing hedges. In the event that adverse foreign exchange movements, higher gold royalties and increasing energy prices continue throughout the remainder of the year, the Company's costs applicable to sales could be near or exceed the top end of our current outlook range.
Regional Operations
In the second quarter of 2010, the Company reported equity gold production of 1.3 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $492 per ounce on a co-product basis.Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce increased 16% in the second quarter of 2010 from 2009 due to higher costs in Nevada, at Yanacocha in Peru and at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, as well as higher-cost production from Boddington, as further described below.
 
North America
 Nevada produced of gold at costs applicable to sales of during the second quarter.  Second quarter 2010 production was slightly higher than the year ago quarter due to higher underground production at Midas and Leeville, partially offset by lower mill throughput at Carlin and Twin Creeks and lower leach tons placed. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% in the second quarter of 2010 from 2009 due to additional surface mining costs related to the 2009 geotechnical event at Gold Quarry.

The processing plant continues to perform in line with expectations with recoveries exceeding Feasibility Study expectations, and the high pressure grinding rolls and wet plant performing better than anticipated.  However, production has been lower than expected as the Company has mined approximately 12% less contained gold, partially offset by 23% more contained copper, than originally modeled. As a result of lower gold production, higher direct mining costs and a stronger Australian dollar, gold production for 2010 is now expected between at costs applicable to sales of (compared with an original outlook of 800,000 to 875,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $375 to $395 per ounce).  A stronger Australian dollar accounts for approximately 25% of the expected increase in operating costs, with increased mining costs accounting for approximately 50% and lower volume and other factors accounting for the remainder. Copper production outlook for 2010 remains unchanged at between at costs applicable to sales now of between (compared with an original outlook of between $1.30 and $1.45 per pound).

For 2011, the Company expects gold production at Boddington of between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $475 and $525 per ounce as the operation begins its first year of steady-state production.  It is still too early in the ramp-up process to conclusively determine any longer-term impacts of the lower gold ore grades experienced to date (with less than 2% of total reserves mined thus far).
 Equity gold and copper production during the second quarter at Batu Hijau in Indonesia were and , respectively, at costs applicable to sales of and , respectively.  Equity gold and copper production increased 49% and 27% in the second quarter of 2010 from 2009, respectively, due to higher grade ore from Phase 5, partially offset by lower recovery. Costs applicable to sales increased 28% and 14% for gold and copper, respectively, in the second quarter of 2010 from 2009 due to higher waste mining and milling costs.  Production during the second quarter was adversely affected by unusually heavy rainfall.

The Company has increased its exploration forecast by approximately $30 million due to successful drilling at the Leeville/Turf operation in Nevada.  In addition, the Company now expects full-year General & Administrative expenses to be at or above the high end of our original outlook range of $160 to $170 million based on higher overall labor costs.  It is also anticipated that Advanced Projects and R&D spending will be at the high end of our original outlook of $230 to $250 million due to higher spending on the Hope Bay project. Financial and other overhead outlook is as follows:

Supplemental Information
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income
Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company's operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations.  The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill.  Management's determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.
Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows:
 
 
Reconciliation of Co-Product Costs Applicable to Sales to By-Product Costs Applicable to Sales
Sales and Costs applicable to sales for Boddington are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold and copper due to the significant portion of copper production (approximately 15-20% of total revenue based on the latest life-of-mine plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a relative proportion of sales values for other costs. Management also assesses the performance of the Boddington mine on a by-product basis due to the majority of sales being derived from gold and to determine contingent consideration payments to AngloGold. The by-product method deducts copper sales from costs applicable to sales as shown in the following table:
