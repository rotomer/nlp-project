ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503(b)(1) of the Act requires a Current Report on Form 8-K if a company is issued an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (an "Order") by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.
On August 28, 2010, Newmont USA Limited (the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation, received an Order stating that an employee at the Twin Creek Mine was observed accessing a piece of mine equipment while carrying a lunch box. The employee attached the box to his body without incident, which immediately terminated the Order. On the same day, the Company received an additional Order stating that an employee was observed on the hand-railed decking of a large front-end loader without fall protective devices while maneuvering the loader around maintenance shop facilities. The loader was stopped and the employee immediately exited without incident, which terminated the Order.
The conditions cited in the Orders referred to above did not result in accidents or injury and had no material adverse impact on the Company's operations at the Twin Creek Mine.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
