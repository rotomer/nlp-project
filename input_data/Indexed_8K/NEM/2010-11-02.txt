Third Quarter 2010 Highlights:
 
With the substantial free cash flow that we continue to generate in the current metal price environment, we remain focused on progressing the development of our next generation of mining projects, said Richard OBrien, President and Chief Executive Officer. This includes Conga in Peru, Akyem in Ghana, and Hope Bay in Canada, as well as a series of satellite deposits in Nevada. Of the $1.3-$1.5 billion in capital we expect to spend this year, approximately 40% will be invested in our development pipeline, with increasing reinvestment expected over the next several years.
 
With three quarters of production completed, the Company is narrowing its previously announced 2010 outlook for equity gold production from 5.3 to 5.5 million ounces to .  In addition, Newmont is updating its 2010 outlook for costs applicable to sales from between $460 and $480 per ounce to between based on the higher gold price and weaker US dollar.

Supplemental Information
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income
Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Companys operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations.  The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill.  Managements determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.
Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows:
(1) Attributable to Newmont stockholders.
Reconciliation of Co-Product Costs Applicable to Sales to By-Product Costs Applicable to Sales
Sales and Costs applicable to sales for Boddington are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold and copper due to the significant portion of copper production (approximately 15-20% of total revenue based on the latest life-of-mine plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a relative proportion of sales values for other costs. Management also assesses the performance of the Boddington mine on a by-product basis due to the majority of sales being derived from gold and to determine contingent consideration payments to AngloGold. The by-product method deducts copper sales from costs applicable to sales as shown in the following table:
