Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously announced, on February 3, 2011, Newmont Mining Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Fronteer Gold Inc., an Ontario corporation ("Fronteer"), entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the "Agreement") among the Company, Fronteer, and Pilot Gold Inc., a Canadian corporation ("Pilot"), and related agreements.  Pursuant to the Agreement, subject to terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Fronteer by way of a Plan of Arrangement (the "Arrangement") and Fronteer shareholders will receive Cdn$14.00 in cash and one common share of Pilot for each common share of Fronteer owned by such holder.  The common shares of Pilot will be consolidated on a one for four basis pursuant to the Arrangement such that, upon the completion of the Arrangement , every Fronteer shareholder will hold one Pilot share for every four shares of Fronteer previously owned.  Pilot will own certain exploration assets of Fronteer and, upon closing of the transaction, former Fronteer shareholders will hold an aggregate 80.1% interest in Pilot and the Company will hold, indirectly, the remaining 19.9% interest.
The Arrangement will be carried out by way of a Plan of Arrangement, the implementation of which will be subject to approval by at least 66% of the votes cast at a special meeting of Fronteer Gold shareholders that is expected to be held in April 2011, and the subsequent approval of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the transaction is also subject to applicable regulatory approvals, the absence of injunctions or other legal restraints on the transaction, the qualification of the distribution of the Pilot shares for certain exemptions from the Canadian and U.S. securities laws, the completion of certain reorganization actions with respect to Pilot, the accuracy of the parties' representations and warranties, each party's compliance with covenants under the Agreement, the absence of a material adverse effect on Fronteer , and confirmation that holders of no more than 10% of Fronteer's outstanding shares have exercised dissenters' rights.
Fronteer and the Company
have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) with respect to the conduct of its business during the interim period between the execution of the Agreement and consummation of the Arrangement; and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period.
The Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Fronteer, including, but not limited to, in the event that (i) the Arrangement is not consummated by June 30, 2011; (ii) a final and nonappealable injunction or court order prohibits consummation of the Arrangement; (iii) Fronteer's shareholders do not approve the Arrangement; or (iv) either party breaches its obligations or representations in a manner that cannot be cured by June 30, 2011.  In addition, the Company may terminate the Agreement in the event that Fronteer's board of directors changes its recommendation to shareholders in favor of the Arrangement, the Fronteer shareholder meeting has not occurred by May 6, 2011, or Fronteer notifies the Company that it has received an alternative proposal that it considers to be superior to the Arrangement.  Fronteer may also terminate the Agreement in cer tain circumstances where it has determined an alternative proposal to be superior to the Arrangement subject to a right to match in favor of the Company.  Upon termination of the Agreement in
certain circumstances, Fronteer may be obligated to pay the Company a termination fee of Cdn$85 million.
 
 
All of the directors and senior officers, as well as an outside shareholder of Fronteer, have entered into customary support agreements pursuant to which, among other things, they have agreed to vote their common shares in favor of the transaction.
The terms and conditions of the proposed transaction will be summarized in Fronteer's management information circular.  Copies of the Agreement and certain related documents will be filed with Canadian securities regulators and are being filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as Exhibit 2.1 to this Report and will be available on the Canadian SEDAR website at www.sedar.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The management information circular will also be available as part of Fronteer's public filings at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov.

Target shall deliver a written notice and election form to all holders of Target Options prior to the Effective Date advising such holders that the holders of Target Options may, notwithstanding any vesting or exercise provisions to which a Target Option might otherwise be subject (whether by contract, the conditions of a grant, applicable law or the terms of the Target Option Plans), elect to:
(i)
                
surrender Target Options to Target for cancellation  pursuant to section 3(a)(ii)(A)

Covenants of Acquiror Regarding the Performance of Obligations
Acquiror shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, perform all obligations required to be performed by Acquiror or any of Acquirors subsidiaries under this Agreement which for greater certainty includes all obligations required to be performed by Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries under Schedule B to the Target Disclosure Letter, co-operate with Target in connection therewith, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such further acts and things as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

            typically applied for by an acquiror and, in doing so, keep Target reasonably informed as to the status of the proceedings related to obtaining the Key Regulatory Approvals, including providing Target with copies of all related applications and notifications in draft form (except that where such material is confidential, contains information relating to the valuation of the transactions herein, or is subject to privilege or immunity, it will in each case be provided (subject to applicable Laws) to Target's outside counsel on an "external counsel" basis), in order for Target to provide its reasonable comments thereon; and
(b)
              
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Plan of Arrangement and applicable Laws and in compliance with Section 2.7, pay the aggregate Consideration to be paid pursuant to the Arrangement at the time provided herein.
< B>
5.5
                                     
Mutual Covenants
Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated in this Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the time that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms:
(a)
               
it shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of) the conditions precedent to its obligations hereunder as set forth in Article 6 to the extent the same is within its control and to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable under all applicable Laws to complete the Plan of Arrangement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) obtain all Key Regulatory Approvals required to be obtained by it; (ii) effect o r make promptly all necessary registrations, filings and submissions of information requested by Governmental Entities required to be effected by it in connection with the Plan of Arrangement; (iii) oppose, lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order against it or other order or action against it seeking to stop, or otherwise adversely affecting its ability to make and complete, the Plan of Arrangement; and (iv) co-operate with the other Party in connection with the performance by it and its subsidiaries of their obligations hereunder; in addition, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, none of the Parties shall knowingly take or cause to be taken any action which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(b)
              
it shall not take any action, refrain from taking any commercially reasonable action, or permit any action to be taken or not taken, which is inconsistent with this Agreement or which would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially delay or materially impede the making or completion of the Plan of Arrangement except as permitted by this Agreement;
(c)
               
Target shall effect such reorganization of its business, operations, subsidiaries and assets or such other transactions as Acquiror may reasonably request (each, a "
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
") prior to or following the Effective Time, and
 
 
           the Plan of Arrangement, if required, shall be modified accordingly; provided, however, that Target need not effect a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization which in the opinion of Target, acting reasonably: (i) would require Target to obtain the prior approval of the shareholders of Target in respect of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization other than at the Target Meeting; or (ii) would impede or delay the consummation of the Arrangement by more than 20 Business Days. Without limiting the foregoing and other than as set forth in clause (ii) above, Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from any Persons to effect each Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, and Target shall cooperate with Acquiror in structuring, planning and impleme nting any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. Target shall also cooperate with Acquiror to the extent reasonable in the preparation and filing of any request for an advance income tax ruling or private letter ruling. Acquiror shall provide written notice to Target of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Date. In addition:
(i)
                
Acquiror shall indemnify and save harmless Target and its subsidiaries' respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization or as a result of the reversal (where such reversal is determined by Target to be necessary, acting reasonably) of all or any of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganization steps in the event the Arrangement does not proceed (including actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses for filing fees and external counsel);
(ii)
              
unless the Parties otherwise agree, any Pre-Acquisition R eorganization to be effected prior to the Effective Time shall not become effective unless Acquiror shall have confirmed in writing the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions in its favour in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 and shall have confirmed in writing that it is prepared to promptly without condition (other than the satisfaction of the condition contemplated by Section 6.2(a) as it relates to the Pre-Acquisition Reorganization) proceed to effect the Arrangement;
(iii)
            
any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not require Target or any subsidiary to contravene any applicable Laws, their respective organizational documents or any Contract;
(iv)
            
Target and its subsidiaries shall not be obligated to take any action that has a material likelihood of resulting in any material adverse Tax or other consequences to any securityholder of Target or to Spinco or any subsidiary of Spinco; and
(v)
              
such cooperation does not require the directors, officers or employees of Target to take any action in any capacity other than as a director, officer or employee, as applicable.
 
 
(d)
              
Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that the planning for and implementation of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization requested by Acquiror shall not be considered a breach of any covenant under this Agreement and shall not be considered in determining whether a representation or warranty of Target hereunder has been breached. Acquiror and Target shall work cooperatively and use reasonable commercial efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. For greater certainty and without limiting the indemnity contained in Section 8.1, Target shall not be liable for any Taxes arising as a result of, or the failure of Acquiror to benefit from any anticipated tax efficiency as a result of, a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization.
(e)
               
For the avoidance of doubt, Target shall not be required pursuant to Section 8.1 to indemnify Acquiror for any Taxes which arise as a result of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization.
5.6

in connection with the termination referred to in Section 5.6(a)(i) above, Target shall make all payments in a lump sum (less applicable statutory deductions) in respect of the Change of Control Payments set out in Section 3.1(y) of the Target Disclosure Letter. Acquiror and Target acknowledge and agree that completion of the Arrangement will be treated as triggering the Change of Control Payments; and
(iii)
            
if the Effective Date occurs other than at the end of a regular pay period of the Target, Target shall pay to all Designated Target Employees all salary, bonus, vacation pay or other payments payable to them in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practice and their respective employment agreements, service contracts, and in accordance with applicable Laws or otherwise that have accrued in respect of that pay period and which remain unpaid on the day prior to the Effective Date.
(b)
              
Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that immediately prior to the Effective Time:
(i)
                
Target shall terminate the employment of any employees of Target and its subsidiaries that are not Designated Target Employees or Retained Employees with such termination being conditional on closing of the Arrangement and taking effect at the Effective Time; and
(ii)
              
in connection with the termination referred to in Section 5.6(b)(i) above, Target shall pay in a lump sum (less any applicable statutory deductions) a
 
 
            severance payment to each such employee in an amount that is equal to the greater of (A) one month's salary for each year of service (pro rated to actual length of service), and (B) such employee's entitlements under applicable Law (as determined by Fronteer's counsel, acting reasonably and in consultation with Acquiror's external counsel) or contract; and
(iii)
            
if the Effective Date occurs other than at the end of a regular pay period of the Target, Target shall pay to each employee referred to in Section 5.6(b)(i) all salary, bonus, vacation pay or other payments payable to them in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practice and, if applicable, their respective employment agreements, service contracts, and in accordance with applicable Laws or otherwise that have accrued in respect of that pay period and which remain unpaid on the day prior to the Effective Date.
(c)
               
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall be entitled to make an offer of employment to any employees of Target and its subsidiaries (including any employee that would, if such employee accepted Spinco's offer of employment contemplated in Section 5.6(d), be a Spinco Employee) on such terms as Acquiror, in its sole discretion, determines are appropriate.
(d)
              
Spinco covenants and agrees that it shall make offers of employment to each of the Spinco Employees (oth er than the Designated Employees) on substantially the same or improved terms as currently enjoyed by such employees having regard to, among other things, title, responsibility, salary, benefits, bonus, vacation entitlement and location of employment.
If the Effective Date occurs, Section 5.6(d) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and be enforceable by the beneficiaries thereof.
5.7
                                     
Adjustment to Consideration regarding Distributions
If on or after the date hereof, Target declares, sets aside or pays any dividend or other distribution to the Target Shareholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time (except for the distribution of Spinco Shares pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement), the Board of Directors of Acquiror and the Target Board shall make such adjustments to the Consideration as they determine acting in good faith to be necessary to restore the original intention of the Parties in the circumstances. For greater certainty, if Target takes any of the actions referred to above, the aggregate consideration to be paid by Acquiror shall be decreased by an equivalent amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.7 shall restrict the ability of Acquiror to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(ii) in the event the condition precedent to the obligations of Acquiror set out in Section 6.2(b) shall not have been met.
5.8
                                     
Spinco Ownership

Acquiror covenants in fa vour of Spinco that, from and after the Effective Time until the second anniversary of the Effective Date, it and its affiliates will not,

If immediately following the Effective Time the Acquiror and its affiliates hold or are entitled to receive Spinco Shares and Spinco Convertible Securities that would result in Acquiror and its affiliates having a Pro Rata Interest in excess of 19.9%, it will, or will cause its affiliate to:
(i)
                
within 90 days of the date the Spinco Shares begin trading on the TSX or TSX Venture Exchange, as applicable (the "
Required Sale Date
"), sell in an orderly fashion such number of Spinco Shares and/or Spinco Convertible Securities (the "
Excess Securities
") as would, after giving effect to the sale of such Excess Securities, reduce Acquiror's and its affiliates' Pro Rata Interest to an amount that is not in excess of 19.9%, provided that prior to making any block sale trades, Acquiror shall provide notice to Spinco that it or its affiliate intends to make a block sale trade at a specified price and if within five (5) Business Days of receiving such notice, Spinco identifies a buyer that is willing to purchase all but not less than all of such block of Excess Securities at a price that is at least equal to such specified price, Acquiror shall, or shall cause its affiliate to, sell such Excess Securities to the buyer identified by Spinco within such five Business Day period or such later time frame as Acquiror and such buyer may agree; and
(ii)

If the Effective Time occurs, this Section 5.8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

7.1
                                     
Non-Solicitation
(a)
               
On and after the date hereof until the date upon which this Agreement is terminated, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7.1, Target shall not, directly or indirectly, or through any of its Representatives, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their Representatives not to:
(i)
                
solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding) any inquiries or proposals whatsoever which would constitute an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii)
              
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Acquiror, any of its affiliates or its or their Representatives) regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(iii)
            
approve, accept, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to accept, approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;
(iv)
            
accept or enter into or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any agreement, understanding or arrangement or other contract in respect of an Acquisition Proposal; or
(v)
              
make a Change in Recommendation, unless (A) it does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal and (B) in the opinion of the Target Board, acting in good faith and after receiving advice from its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Target Board is required to make a Change in Recommendation in order to comply with the fiduciary duties of such directors under applicable Law.
(b)
              
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.1, Target shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
 
 
            be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons (other than Acquiror and its Representatives) conducted heretofore by Target, its subsidiaries or its or their Representatives with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith, Target will discontinue access to any of its confidential information (and not establish or allow access to any of its confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise) and shall as soon as possible request, to the extent that it is entitled to do so (and exercise all rights it has to require) the return or destruction of all confidential information (including all material including or incorporating or otherwise reflecting any material confidential information) rega rding Target and its subsidiaries previously provided to any such Person or any other Person. Target agrees that, except as permitted by Section 7.1(c), neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing confidentiality agreement relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal or any standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (it being acknowledged and agreed that the automatic termination of any standstill provisions of any such agreement as the result of the entering into and announcement of this Agreement by Target, pursuant to the express terms of any such agreement, shall not be a violation of this Section 7.1(c)) and Target undertakes to enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-solicitation and similar covenants that it or any of its subsidiaries have entered into prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the Target Board from considering an Acquisitio n Proposal that is reasonably likely to be a Superior Proposal and accepting a Superior Proposal that might be made by any such third party if the remaining provisions of this Agreement have been complied with.
(c)
               
Notwithstanding Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(b) and any other provision of this Agreement or of any other agreement between Acquiror and Target, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Target Shareholder Approval of the Arrangement Resolution at the Target Meeting, Target receives a written Acquisition Proposal (that w as not solicited after the date hereof in contravention of Section 7.1(a) and provided that Target is in compliance with Sections 7.1(b) and 7.1(a)), the Target Board may (directly or through its advisors or Representatives):
(i)
                
if it believes, acting in good faith, that the Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be a Superior Proposal, contact the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions thereto and likelihood of consum mation so as to determine whether such proposal is, or is reasonably likely to be, a Superior Proposal; and
(ii)
              
if, in the opinion of the Target Board, acting in good faith and after receiving advice from its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or, if consummated in accordance with its terms (disregarding, for the purposes of any such determination, any term of such Acquisition Proposal that provides for a
 
 
            due diligence investigation), would be a Superior Proposal, then, and only in such case, Target may:
(A)
            
furnish information with respect to Target and its subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal for a period of not more than 21 days; and/or
(B)
             
participate in discussions or negotiations with, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal; and/or
(C)
             
waive any standstill provision or agreement that would otherwise prohibit such person from making an Acquisition Proposal,
provided that Target shall not, and shall not allow its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information with respect to Target to such Person (i) if such non-public information has not been previously provided to, or is not concurrently provided to, Acquiror; (ii) without entering into a confidentiality and standstill agreement (if one has not already been entered into) which is customary in such situations and which is no less favourable to Target and no more favourable to the counterparty than the confidentiality and standstill provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (iii) without providing a copy of such confidentiality agreement to Acquiror.
7.2
                                     
Notification of Acquisition Proposals
(a)
               
Tar get shall promptly notify Acquiror, at first orally and then in writing within 24 hours of receipt of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request received by Target or its Representatives after the date hereof (i) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that could reasonably lead to or be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) for discussions or negotiations in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) for non-public information relating to Target or its subsidiaries, access to properties, books and records or a list of the Target Shareholders. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry or request, include a copy of the Acquisition Proposal and include a copy of any other documentation received by Target or its Representatives and such other details of the Acquisition Proposal known to Target as Acquiror may reasonably request. Target shall keep Acquiror promptly and fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms, of such proposal, inquiry, offer or request and shall respond promptly to all reasonable inquiries by Acquiror with respect thereto and shall provide copies of any written documents or correspondence provided to Target relating to such Acquisition Proposal.
(b)
              
Subject to Section 7.3(a), at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining Target Shareholder Approval, if Target receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Target Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the T arget Board may, subject to compliance with the procedures set
 
 
            forth in Section 9.2 and Section 9.4, terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.
7.3
                                     
Responding to Acquisition Proposal and Superior Proposals
(a)
               
Notwithstanding Section 7.1 and subject to compliance with Target's obligations in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, Target may enter into a definitive agreement (a "
Proposed Agreement
") with any third party providing for an Acquisition Proposal, if such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; provided that Target may do so only after Target has provided Acquiror with written notice that the Target Boar d has determined that it has received a Superior Proposal (a "
Superior Proposal Notice
"), which identifies the party making the Superior Proposal, specifies the cash amount that the Target Board has ascribed to any non-cash consideration being offered in the Superior Proposal, and provides Acquiror with a copy of any Proposed Agreement, in each case not less than five Business Days (the "
Response Period
") prior to the proposed execution of such Proposed Agreement by Target. For purposes of this Agreement, the Response Period shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (Mountain
time) on the fifth Business Day following the day on which the Superior Proposal Notice and Proposed Agreement was provided to Acquiror.
(b)
              
During the Response Period, Target acknowledges and agrees that Acquiror shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement (including increasing or modifying the consideration to be received by the Former Target Shareholders) in order to provide for terms at least equivalent to those provided fo r in the Superior Proposal. If Acquiror does so, then the Target Board shall review any such proposal by Acquiror to determine (acting in good faith and in accordance with its fiduciary duties) whether the Acquisition Proposal to which Acquiror is responding would continue to be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the amended Agreement and Plan of Arrangement as proposed by Acquiror. If the Target Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal would thereby cease to be a Superior Proposal, it will cause Target to enter into an amendment to this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement reflecting the offer by Acquiror to amend the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Arrangement and will further agree not to enter into the applicable Proposed Agreement and not to withdraw, modify or change any recommendation regarding the Plan of Arrangement save and except to reaffirm its recommendation of the amended Plan of Arrangement.
(c)
               
If (i) Acquiror does not offer to amend the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Arrangement within the Response Period or (ii) the Target Board determines acting in good faith and in the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties (after consultation with its financial advisor and after receiving advice from its outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal would nonetheless remain a Superior Proposal with respect to Acquiror's proposal to amend the Agreement and Plan of Arrangement, and therefore rejects Acquiror's offer to amend the Plan of Arrangement and this Agreement, Target shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(d)(i) following the expiry of the Response
 
 
            Period and enter into the Proposed Agreement upon payment to Acquiror of the amount payable pursuant to Section 9.4.
(d)
              
Target acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the requirement of Section 7.3 to initiate an additio nal five Business Day Response Period.
(e)
               
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Target Board from responding through a directors' circular or otherwise as required by applicable Laws to an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a Superior Proposal. Acquiror and its advisors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the content of any directors' circular prior to its printing and Target shall consider for inclusion all reasonable comments made by Acquiror and its advisors.
7.4
                                     
Access to Information; Confidentiality
From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and the terms of any existing Contracts, Target shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to Acquiror and its Representatives (upon reasonable advance notice and, at the option of Target, with a Target representative present), such reasonable access during regular business hours as Acquiror may reasonably require at all reasonable times, without disruption to the conduct of Target business, including for the purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to their officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts of Target and its subsidiaries, and shall furnish Acquiror with all data and information (other than da ta and information relating solely to the Target Exploration Properties except as may be required to confirm (a) the proper designation of any assets and/or liabilities of Target and its subsidiaries as Spinco Assets and/or Spinco Liabilities, as applicable, and (b) that the Spinco Assets and Spinco Liabilities have been duly transferred to Spinco prior to the Effective Time) as Acquiror may reasonably request. Acquiror and Target acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.
7.5
                                     
Insurance and Indemnification
(a)
               
Target shal l be entitled to purchase run off directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of up to six years from the Effective Date with the prior written consent of Acquiror, not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that the aggregate cost therefor does not exceed 200% of the annual premiums currently in effect. Acquiror shall cause Target to ensure that the articles and/or by-laws of Target and its subsidiaries (or their respective successors) shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in Target's or the applicable subsidiary's current articles and/or by-laws, which provisions shall not, except to the extent required by applicable Laws, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Date in any manner that would adversely affect any rights of indemnification of individuals who,
 
 
            immediately prior to the Effective Date, were directors or officers of Target or any of its subsidiaries.
(b)
              
Acquiror agrees that it shall directly honour all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former officers and directors of Target and its subsidiaries to the extent that they are disclosed in S ection 7.5(b) of the Target Disclosure Letter, and acknowledges that such rights, to the extent that they are disclosed in Section 7.5(b) of the Target Disclosure Letter, shall survive the completion of the Plan of Arrangement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Date.
(c)
               
The provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, Target he reby confirms that it is acting as agent and trustee on their behalf. Furthermore, this Section 7.5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement as a result of the occurrence of the Effective Date for a period of six years.
8.1
                                     
Spinco Indemnity
From the Effective Time, Spinco hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Target and its subsidiaries (each an "
Indemnified Party
") from all losses suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with an Indemnified Liability; provided that Spinco shall have no liability hereunder in respect of any Claims unless an Indemnified Party shall have delivered an Indemnity Notice in respect of such Claim within six (6) years following the Effective Date, provided that Spinco shall have liability hereunder in respect of any Claims for Taxes provided that an Indemnified Party shall have delivered an Indemnity Notice in respect of such Claim prior to t he date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation (including all periods of extension). If the Effective Date occurs, this Section 8.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
8.2
                                     
Indemnified Claims
(a)
               
If any claim, proceedi ng, liability (including a liability for Tax) or other matter resulting from the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by Section 8.1 above (a "Claim") is made against an Indemnified Party by a third party for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall give notice (an "Indemnity Notice") to Spinco specifying the particulars of such Claim within 20 days after it receives notification of the Claim. Spinco shall have the right to participate in any negotiations or proceedings with respect to any such Claim. An Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Claim without the prior written consent of Spinco, unless Spinco has not, within 20 Business Days after the giving of the Indemnity Notice, given notice to the Indemnified Party that it wishes to dispute such Claim. If Spinco does give such a
 
 
            notice, it shall have the right to assume the defence of such Claim and to defend such Claim in the name of the Indemnified Party. An Indemnified Party shall provide to Spinco all files, books, records and other information in their possession or control which may be relevant to the defence of such Claim. If Spinco fails after giving such notice, diligently and reasonably to defend such Claim throughout the period such Claim exists, its right to defend the Claim shall terminate and the Indemnified Party may assume the defence of such Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party may assume the defence of such Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party may compromise or settle such Claim without the consent of Spinco. If the Effective Date occurs, this Section 8.2 shall surviv e the termination of this Agreement.
(b)
              
Notwithstanding Section 8.2(a):
(i)
                
if a Claim described in Section 8.2(a) include s or would reasonably be expected to include both a Claim for Taxes that are Indemnified Liabilities (an "
Indemnified Tax Claim
") and a Claim for Taxes that are not Indemnified Liabilities (an "
Unindemnified Tax Claim
"), the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to separate the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim from the defence of the Unindemnified Tax Claim, and in the case of such separation Spinco shall have the rights provided in Section 8.2(a) in respect of the Indemnified Tax Claim only;
(ii)
              
if the Indemnified Party is not able to separate the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim from the defence of the Unindemnified Tax Claim:
(A)
            
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defence of both such Claims, including the right to settle either or both of such Claims;
(B)
             
the Indemnified Party shall act in good faith with a view to the merits in connection with the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim; and
(C)
             
the Indemnified Party shall afford Spinco the opportunity to participate in the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim, provide Spinco with notice and access to documentation and information as is reasonable in the circumstances, otherwise keep Spinco updated and informed, and consult with Spinco with respect to the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim;
(iii)
            
the Indemnified Party shall provide Spinco with notice of the resolution of any Indemnified Tax Claim within 20 days of such resolution;
(iv)
            
without limiting in a ny respect the Indemnified Party's right to settle any such Indemnified Claim in its absolute discretion, in the event that Spinco
 
 
            objects to a resolution of an Indemnified Tax Claim by delivering notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 days of receiving the notice set out in (iii), a neutral nationally recognized accountant (the "
Tax Arbitrator
") that is mutually reasonably satisfactory to the parties shall determine the amount, if any, by which:
(A)
            
the amount of Tax for which the Indemnified Tax Claim was resolved; exceeds
(B)
             
the amount of Tax for which the Indemnified Tax Claim could reasonably have been expected to be resolved if it had been the only matter in dispute;
(v)
              
if the Tax Arbitrator determines that the amount specified in 8.2(b)(iv)(A) does not exceed the amount specified in 8.2(b)(iv)(B), Spinco shall be liable for:
(A)
            
pursuant to Section 8.1, the Indemnified Tax Claim based on the amount specified in Section 8.2(b)(iv)(A); and
(B)
             
all costs and expenditures in respect of the arbitration, including the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs;
(vi)
            
if the Tax Arbitrator determines that the amount specified in Section 8.2(b)(iv)(A) exceeds the amount specified in Section 8.2(b)(iv)(B)
(A)
            
pursuant to section 8.1, Spinco shall be liable for the Indemnified Tax Claim based on the amount specified in Section 8.2(b)(iv)(B); and

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the Termination Fee is a payment of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which Acquiror will suffer or incur as a result of the cancellation and termination of all rights and obligations with respect to the indirect acquisition of Target by Acquiror, that such payments are not for lost profits or a penalty, and that no Party shall take any position inconsistent with the foregoing. Target irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Acquiror hereby acknowledges and agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where Acquiror is entitled to the Termination Fee and such Termination Fee is paid in full to Acquiror, Acquiror shall be precluded from any other remedy against Target at law or in equity or otherwise (including, without limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Target or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
(d)

(e)
               
Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall preclude a Party from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

Acquiror or Spinco identifies any Target Exploration Properties, Spinco Assets or Spinco Liabilities which are held or payable, as applicable, by Target or any of its subsidiaries,
the Party making such identification will promptly give written notice to the holder of such asset, property, Contract or liability and, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, the Party holding such asset, property or Contract will, or if held by a subsidiary of such Party, such Party will cause its subsidiary to transfer such asset, property or Contract to or to the direction of the appropriate Party. In the event that the Party making such identification identifies a Spinco Liability, Spinco shall assume such liability as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice by executing such documents or instruments as requested by Acquiror. If the Effective Date occurs, this Section 10.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
