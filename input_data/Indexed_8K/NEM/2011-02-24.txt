Newmont Reports 76% Increase in Net Income to a Record $2.3 Billion and Record $3.2 Billion of Operating Cash Flow in 2010
This release should be read in conjunction with Newmont's 2010 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2011 (available at www.newmont.com).
DENVER, Feb. 24, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) ("Newmont" or the "Company") today announced that net income increased 76% to $2.3 billion ($4.63 per share) in 2010, compared to $1.3 billion ($2.66 per share) in the prior year.  Operating cash flow was a record $3.2 billion for 2010, compared to $2.9 billion in 2009.  Adjusted net income(1) rose 39% to a record $1.9 billion ($3.85 per share) from $1.4 billion ($2.79 per share) in 2009, while the Company's gold operating margin(2) increased by 30% to $737 per ounce in 2010, from $566 per ounce in 2009.
2010 Highlights:
Attributable gold and copper production of 5.4 million ounces and 327 million pounds, respectively, with gold production slightly higher and copper production approximately 44% higher than in 2009;
Record revenue of $9.5 billion, an increase of 24% from 2009;
Average realized gold and copper price of $1,222 per ounce and $3.43 per pound, respectively;
Gold operating margin increase(3) of 30%, compared with an average realized gold price increase of 25%;
Consolidated costs applicable to sales for gold and copper of $485 per ounce and $0.80 per pound, respectively; and
Cash and cash equivalents of more than $4 billion on December 31, 2010.
Q4 2010 Highlights:
Attributable gold and copper production of 1.4 million ounces and 74 million pounds, respectively;
Average realized gold and copper price of $1,366 per ounce and $4.52 per pound, respectively; and
Costs applicable to sales for gold and copper of $512 per ounce and $0.95 per pound, respectively.
"I am pleased to report that we generated record operating cash flow for the second year in a row, with our gold operating margin growing by 30% to $737 per ounce on an average realized gold price of $1,222 in 2010," stated Richard O'Brien, President and CEO.  "As a whole, our operations performed according to our plans, producing 5.4 million attributable ounces of gold in 2010. We continue to advance our Conga Project in Peru, which contains over 6 million attributable ounces of gold and 1.6 billion attributable pounds of copper reserves. Similarly, we continued to advance with our Akyem Project in Ghana, which contains over 7 million attributable ounces of gold reserves. Advancing these two world-class mining projects, as well as continuing our drilling programs at Hope Bay in Canada, remain some of our top priorities in 2011."
Portfolio Wide Operating Results and Outlook
In 2010, the Company reported attributable gold and copper production of 5.4 million ounces and 327 million pounds, respectively, at costs applicable to sales of $485 per ounce, and $0.80 per pound, respectively, on a co-product basis.  Attributable 2010 gold production increased over 2009 levels due to the first full year of production at Boddington and a full year of mining higher grade ore from the bottom of the pit at Batu Hijau.  Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce sold increased 18% over the prior year due to lower production from South America, a full year of higher cost production at Boddington and higher diesel, royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. Costs applicable to sales per copper pound sold increased 25% over the prior year due to higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and a full year of higher cost production at Boddington, partially offset by higher production from Batu Hijau.
2011 attributable gold production is expected to be approximately 5.1 million to 5.3 million ounces, with attributable copper production of 190 to 220 million pounds.  The volume outlook reflects lower expected production at Batu Hijau as it moves into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher production expected at Nevada and Ahafo.  Costs applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per ounce due to lower expected production at Batu Hijau, combined with higher expected costs for energy, labor, and contracted services.  Costs applicable to sales are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound of copper due to lower production at Batu Hijau.
Regional Operations
North America
 Attributable gold production was 429,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 1.7 million ounces in 2010.  Costs applicable to sales were $520 and $565 per ounce for the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively.
Nevada
Fourth quarter production decreased from the prior year quarter due to lower leach placement at Twin Creeks and Carlin, lower Gold Quarry ore mined as a result of the slope failure in late 2009 and lower mill ore grade due to the completion of mining at Deep Post in December 2009.  Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased from the prior year quarter due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits.  
2010 attributable gold ounces decreased 13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in 2009, lower Gold Quarry ore mined as a result of a slope failure which occurred in December 2009 and lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased underground mining at Leeville. Total ore tons mined were 26% lower, primarily due to the Gold Quarry slope failure and the completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 11% due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits.
 Attributable gold production was 49,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 174,000 ounces in 2010.  Costs applicable to sales were $434 and $420 per ounce in the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively.  
La Herradura
Fourth quarter production increased from the prior year quarter due to higher leach placement.  Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased from the prior year quarter due to higher waste mining costs.  
2010 attributable gold ounces produced increased 54% in 2010 from the prior year due to the commencement of commercial production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits in January 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to higher waste tons mined.
2011 attributable gold production in North America is expected to be approximately 2.0 to 2.1 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of approximately $560 to $600 per ounce. Production from Nevada has been impacted by the December 2009 slope failure at Gold Quarry, limiting access to ore originally scheduled to be mined in 2010 and 2011. During 2010, the Company mined through the impacted area and expects to reestablish access to ore in the first half of 2011.
South America
Attributable gold production was 170,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 750,000 ounces in 2010.  Costs applicable to sales were $559 and $431 per gold ounce in the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively.
Yanacocha
 
Fourth quarter production decreased from the prior year quarter due to lower leach placement, transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua and lower mill grade.  Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased from the prior year quarter due to higher waste material mined and higher royalties and lower by-product credits.  
2010 attributable gold production decreased 29% from the prior year due to mine sequencing resulting in increased waste mining, lower leach placement, transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua and lower grade and recovery resulting in lower mill production. Leach tons placed decreased from 136 million tons in 2009, which was a record amount, to 59 million tons in 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% from the prior year due to higher waste material mined, lower production, higher labor, diesel and maintenance costs, and higher workers' participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices, partially offset by higher by-product credits.
 Attributable gold production was 16,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 21,000 ounces in 2010.  La Zanja achieved commercial production in the third quarter 2010.  
La Zanja
2011 attributable gold production in South America is expected to be approximately 715,000-775,000 ounces, primarily due to lower leach production at Yanacocha. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2011 to approximately $500 to $550 per ounce, primarily due to lower gold production and higher contracted services and supplies.
Asia Pacific
 Attributable gold production was 206,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 728,000 ounces in 2010.  Attributable copper production was 15 million pounds in the fourth quarter and 58 million pounds in 2010.  Costs applicable to sales were $624 ($512 on a by-product basis(4)) and $590 ($487 on a by-product basis(4)) per gold ounce and $2.06 and $1.86 per pound of copper, in the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively.  
Boddington
Fourth quarter 2010 production increased from the prior year quarter due to the commencement of commercial production in November 2009.  
2010 production at Boddington was in line with revised guidance.  Costs applicable to sales were higher than expected due to lower production and higher mining and mill maintenance costs.
2011 attributable gold production at Boddington is expected to be approximately 750,000-800,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of approximately $580 to $620 per ounce on a co-product basis. Lower than expected gold production at Boddington is primarily attributable to lower gold ore grade and lower expected mill throughput, while higher operating costs are expected to result from lower than expected production volumes, higher mining costs, as well as higher contracted services and supplies. We continue to review our ore grade and processing models to identify opportunities to optimize and improve our future production and operating costs at Boddington.
 Attributable gold production was 88,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 364,000 ounces in 2010. Attributable copper production was 59 million pounds in the fourth quarter and 269 million pounds in 2010.  Costs applicable to sales were $243 and $237 per gold ounce and $0.81 and $0.69 per pound of copper on a co-product basis in the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively.
Batu Hijau
Fourth quarter copper production decreased from the prior year quarter due to lower mill throughput.  Gold production increased from the prior year quarter due to unseasonably dry weather and continued mining in the bottom of Phase 5, resulting in higher gold grades which offset the lower mill throughput.  Costs applicable to sales per ounce and per pound increased from the prior year quarter due to higher waste mining and milling costs, including higher labor costs.  
2010 attributable copper and gold production increased 10% and 32%, respectively, in 2010 over the prior year due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore, partially offset by lower recovery. Unseasonably dry weather permitted additional mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. Beginning in 2011, we expect to process stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed commencing in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per pound and per ounce due to higher waste mining, labor and diesel costs.
2011 attributable gold production for Batu Hijau is expected to be approximately 110,000-140,000 ounces, at costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $440 per ounce, while attributable copper production is expected to be approximately 120 to 140 million pounds, at costs applicable to sales of between $1.10 and $1.30 per pound.  The decrease from 2010 production levels is primarily due to the processing of stockpiles as Phase 6 stripping continues.  
 Attributable gold production was 259,000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 1.1 million ounces in 2010. Costs applicable to sales were $554 and $546 per ounce in the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively.
Other Australia/New Zealand
Fourth quarter production decreased from the prior year quarter due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Kalgoorlie, partially offset by higher throughput at Tanami.  Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased from the prior year quarter due to lower production and a stronger Australian dollar.  
2010 attributable gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade, throughput and recovery at Kalgoorlie. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to lower production and a stronger Australian dollar.
2011 attributable production for the Asia Pacific region is expected to be approximately 1.9 to 2.0 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase to approximately $600 to $675 per ounce in 2011, primarily driven by lower Batu Hijau production. We expect attributable copper production for the Asia Pacific region of approximately 190 to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 per pound in 2011.
Africa
Attributable gold production was 137,000 and 545,000 ounces, respectively, during the fourth quarter and 2010.  Costs applicable to sales were $433 and $450 per ounce for the fourth quarter and 2010, respectively,.
Fourth quarter production increased from the prior year quarter due to higher mill grade.   Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased from the prior year quarter due to higher production, partially offset by higher labor, power and royalty costs.
2010 attributable gold production increased due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu in 2010 and the commencement of production at Amoma in October 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased slightly due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production.
2011 attributable gold production for the Africa operations is expected to be approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces due to mining higher ore grade. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $485 to $535 per ounce are expected for 2011, primarily as a result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty costs.
Capital Update
Consolidated capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in 2010, down from $1.8 billion in 2009, due to the completion of construction at Boddington.  Approximately $319 million was spent on major projects in 2010, with the balance largely attributed to sustaining capital.  The Company currently plans to spend $2.1 to $2.5 billion in attributable capital expenditures in 2011, or $2.7 to $3.0 billion on a consolidated basis.  Approximately 40% of 2011 consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be related to major project initiatives, including further development of the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada, and the Nevada project portfolio, while the remaining 60% is expected to be for growth and sustaining capital.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income
Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company's operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations.  The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill.  Management's determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.  
Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to adjusted net income as follows:
Reconciliation of Co-Product Costs Applicable to Sales to By-Product Costs Applicable to Sales
Sales and Costs applicable to sales for Boddington are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold and copper due to the significant portion of copper production (approximately 15-20% of revenue based on the latest life-of-mine plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a relative proportion of sales values for other costs. Management also assesses the performance of the Boddington mine on a by-product basis due to the majority of sales being derived from gold and to determine contingent consideration payments to AngloGold. The by-product method deducts copper sales from costs applicable to sales as shown in the following table:

Newmont Gold Reserves Increase to 93.5 Million Ounces
DENVER, February 24, 2011  Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (Newmont or the Company) today announced it increased attributable gold reserves by 1.7 million ounces to 93.5 million ounces in 2010. Highlights include:
Attributable gold Measured and Indicated non-reserve mineralization (NRM)for 2010 was 1.3 billion tons at an average grade of 0.019 ounces per ton, up from 1.1 billion tons at an average grade of 0.020 ounces per ton for 2009. In addition, attributable gold Inferred NRM was 504 million tons at an average grade of 0.026 ounces per ton. Attributable copper Measured and Indicated NRM for 2010 was 849 million tons at an average grade of 0.15%, up from 796 million tons at a grade of 0.17% from 2009. In addition, attributable copper Inferred NRM was 390 million tons at an average grade of 0.15%. Gold and copper NRM were calculated using prices of $1,150 per ounce and $3.00 per pound, respectively.

For 2011, Newmont has budgeted $360 million (on a consolidated basis, including capitalized expenditures) for its exploration program, an increase of approximately 44% from 2010. The significant increase allows for accelerated exploration in all regions including at Leeville-Turf and Hope Bay in North America, Merian and Yanacocha Sulfides in South America, and Elang in Asia Pacific.
We are proud of our recent exploration efforts delivering significant organic additions to our reserves, said Guy Lansdown, EVP of Discovery & Development. These results have encouraged us to significantly increase our exploration spending in 2011.  We believe our global portfolio of land positions offers considerable opportunity for continued reserve growth in our operating districts through the drill bit. Additionally, our generative exploration activities continue to allow us to look beyond current geographies into exciting new opportunities.
Near-Mine Exploration:  2010 Highlights and 2011 Planned Activity
Newmonts 2010 Near Mine Exploration program produced strong results from more than 100 drill rigs and one million meters of drilling.  Results spanned the breadth of the resource pipeline, including replacement of depleted reserves from the drill bit.  Newmonts resource pipeline is well-positioned for aggressive development in 2011 with a 44% budget increase, which will allow Newmont to aggressively develop known targets, determine the full extent of emerging targets, test the viability of new early stage projects and explore for new discoveries.
Highlights of the 2010 Near-Mine Exploration Program
Leeville-Turf, Nevada
At the Leeville-Turf underground mine, 59.5 km of combined surface and underground drilling contributed to expansion of reserves and NRM in 2010.  Underground programs added 364 core holes with positive outcomes adding 1.8 Moz of attributable reserves, 0.6 Moz of NRM and expanded known mineralization in all directions.  Following the discovery of ore-grade mineralization up to 1 km from existing workings in early 2010, $25 million was added to the exploration budget for 20 km of deep surface exploration drilling (as deep as 1,200 meters) up to 2.4 kilometers north of the Turf orebody.  Drill intercepts located approximately 450 and 2,700 meters north of the Turf workings encountered 9 m of 14.6 g/t and 10 m of 14 g/t, respectively.

Greater Gold Quarry, Nevada
Expansion of the Greater Gold Quarry pit contributed to a 1.0 Moz attributable NRM addition in 2010 drawing from a 326 hole (59 km) drilling program and phased layback re-design. There is excellent potential to expand reserves of oxide and refractory ore at Gold Quarry as large-scale drilling programs will continue for at least the next 2-4 years.
Twin Creeks, Nevada
Drilling at Twin Creeks in 2010 included 74 holes (11.5 km).  The program supported cutoff grade changes, pit re-designs and stockpile assignments that combined to add 1.4 Moz of attributable reserves and 0.44 Moz of attributable NRM.
Western Oxides, Peru
At Yanacocha in Peru, the Western District Oxides program at La Quinua Sur, El Tapado and Cerro Negro added 0.6 Moz of attributable reserves. Higher gold price, new metallurgical results and 89 holes drilled in 2008-2009 provided context for updated layback designs and reserve additions.
Merian, Suriname
Based on a total of 179 km drilled in 1,494 holes over the life of the project and positive 2010 prefeasibility studies, 1.8 Moz of attributable NRM was added at the Merian project joint venture. In parallel, the Company is working to finalize a Mineral Agreement with the government of Suriname.
Subika Expansion, Ghana
At the Subika Expansion project, drilling of 28 km in 41 holes aimed at expanding underground and open pit mineral extensions, added 1.1 Moz of attributable open pit reserves in 2010.  The calculation of underground NRM from 91 holes with 25 km of underground core drilling in 2010 will be confirmed through model and stope design updates in mid-2011.  Concurrently, the exploration drift initiated in 2010 advanced 2,635 meters, vent raises were completed and initial test stope production is anticipated in early 2011.  Completion of an underground pre-feasibility study is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011. 
Tanami, Australia
At the Tanami underground mine, the 2007 discovery of the Auron orebody and accelerated drill development has expanded 2010 attributable reserves by 0.7 Moz and attributable NRM by 1.1 Moz.  Drill totals in 2010 added 51 km in 130 core holes.  The Auron orebody sits stratigraphically beneath the Callie mine with potential to access ore from existing underground workings.  Auron has potential to significantly expand mine life at Tanami.  Drilling is designed to continue to prove continuity of this orebody and add resources in 2011.
Hope Bay, Nunavut (Canada)
At Hope Bay, underground drilling, drifting and preparation for test mining will continue in 2011 along with continued exploration of the belt for new discoveries.  Overall drill productivity throughout Hope Bay will increase approximately 50% to an estimated 70-90 km in 2011. The program will focus on confirmation and expansion of known ore bodies plus exploration on the 90 currently identified district targets.
2011 New Near-Mine Activity
Higher metal prices combined with new drilling, metallurgical testing and study work in 2010 led to renewed evaluations on several projects with strong potential to advance in the resource portfolio.  These include the Sleeping Giants (Mike, Fiberline, Copper Basin and Greater Phoenix) in Nevada, Yanacocha Verde in South America and Elang in Indonesia.
In 2010, a series of internal pre-scoping assessments were completed on the Sleeping Giants in Nevada to evaluate these assets in the context of current metal pricing, current global portfolio opportunities and approximately 20 km of new drilling information.  Positive results on these efforts resulted in four of these very large assets advancing into scoping studies and further exploration as part of the early development pipeline.

Elang is a copper and gold porphyry deposit lying 60 km east of the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia.  Increased gold and copper prices enabled the Company to re-evaluate economic potential with positive preliminary results in an early-stage conceptual setting.  Drill permits are approved for the deposit and a 6-10 km drill program is anticipated in 2011 to improve confidence in and possibly expand the consolidated 25 Moz gold and 16 Blb copper target (based on a 3 party JORC-compliant resource estimate effective June 2010).
rd
At the Yanacocha Verde project in Peru, exciting new metallurgical results may unlock gold and copper mineralization directly below the oxide deposits in the Yanacocha district. The exploration program is focused on quickly advancing to pilot-scale testing and resource conversion drilling.

In 2010, Newmont continued to position its Generative Exploration program in the top five percent most prospective geological domains worldwide, where the potential exists for district size opportunities. With a $50 million budget, the Generative Exploration program continued its success of finding and delivering district potential targets into the project pipeline as part of its commitment to organic growth.
Highlights include:
The new discovery at Cassador in Suriname in the Guiana Shield is a good example of Newmonts successful exploration ventures in discovering and building the next mineral district. Limited exploration scout drilling to date confirmed the target potential over a 1 km strike length and down to a depth of approximately 200 meters. In addition, there is evidence from scout drilling that the mineralized system extends at least 3 km along strike; it contains a number of blind shoots parallel to the main structure and it extends for at least another 100 meters at depth with the system getting stronger. There are also a number of structures parallel to the main structure with encouraging soil geochemical and trench results.
Based on the size and quality of the current portfolio of undrilled targets the Company has increased the Generative Exploration budget to approximately $60 million in 2011, representing a 20% increase relative to 2010. Highlights of the 2011 program include:

Cautionary Statement:
:  This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.  Forward-looking statements in this news release include, without limitation: (i) 2011 budget estimates, including estimates of future expenditures; (ii) statements regarding future exploration potential, results, Reserves and non-reserve mineralization (NRM); (iii) expectations regarding the ability to enter into future mineral agreements; and (iv) expectations regarding future drilling and testing.  Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect.  Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of the Companys early stage and other projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (iii) political developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) certain exchange rate assumptions; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, copper and oil; (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; and (vii) the accuracy of our current Mineral Reserve and NRM estimates. Where the Company expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, gold and other metals price volatility, currency fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, political and operational risks in the countries in which we operate, and governmental regulation.  For additional information regarding key risk factors and assumptions, please see Newmonts most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.  The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any forward-looking statement, including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued forward-looking statement constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on forward-looking statements is at investors' own risk.
Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
:  Ian Douglas, Newmonts Group Executive of Reserves and Geostatistics, is the qualified person responsible for the preparation of the Reserve and NRM estimates in this presentation. The Reserves disclosed in this presentation have been prepared in compliance with Industry Guide 7 published by the SEC. As used in this news release, the term Reserve means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term economically, as used in this definition, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term legally, as used in this definition, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmonts current mine plans. Reserves in this news release may be aggregated from the Proven and Probable classes.  As used in this news release, the term non-reserve mineralization or NRM refers to Measured, Indicated and/or Inferred materials, which are exclusive of reserves. Newmont has determined that such NRM would be substantively the same as those prepared using the Guidelines established by the Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration and defined as Resources.  Estimates of NRM are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be given that they will eventually convert to future Mineral Reserves of the company. In addition, our current or future reserves and exploration and development projects may not result in new mineral producing operations.  Even if significant mineralization is discovered and converted to reserves, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration to development and ultimately to production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.  Additionally, references to attributable ounces, attributable pounds and attributable mineralization in this news release are intended to mean that portion of gold or copper produced, sold or included in Proven and Probable Reserves or NRM that is attributable to our ownership or economic interest.
