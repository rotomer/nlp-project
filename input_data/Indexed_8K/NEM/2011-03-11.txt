ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (an "Order") issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA").
On March 9, 2011, Boart Longyear Company, an independent contractor for Newmont USA Limited (the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation, received a verbal Order by MSHA at the Leeville mine alleging that sections of steel water well casing staged at a well site were not properly secured to prevent potential movement.  The Company was not cited. The casing was secured and the Order was immediately terminated. No accident or injury occurred and no adverse impact on the Company's operations at the Leeville mine resulted from the condition alleged in the Order.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
