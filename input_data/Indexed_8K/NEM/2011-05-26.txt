ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On May 20, 2011 (the Effective Date), Newmont Mining Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, The Bank of Nova Scotia, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and UBS Loan Finance LLC, as co-syndication agents and Bank of Montreal, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as co-documentation agents  (the Credit Agreement).  The Credit Agreement provides for the extension of credit to the Company by the lenders thereunder in the form of committed revolving loans or uncommitted competitive loans, by the swingline lender thereunder in the form of swingline loans (in an amount not to exceed $200 million) and by issuing banks thereunder in the form of letters of credit (in an amount not to exceed $1.25 billion), in an aggregate amount of up to $2.5 billion (the Revolving Credit Facility).  Interest rates and fees under the Credit Agreement generally vary based on the credit ratings of the Companys senior, unsecured, long-term debt.  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.900% to 1.575% or (ii) the greatest of the lead banks prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% plus, in each case, a margin of up to 0.575%.  Facility fees accrue at a rate per annum ranging from 0.100% to 0.300% of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.  Letter of credit fees accrue at a rate per annum ranging from 0.450% to 1.575% of the outstanding letters of credit and at a rate separately agreed upon by the Company and the issuing banks thereunder.  The Company may request increases in the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility of up to $500 million.  The Credit Agreement expires on May 20, 2016, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with its terms.
The Credit Agreement replaces the Companys existing $2 billion credit agreement dated as of July 30, 2004, as amended, among the Company, Newmont USA Limited, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the 2004 Credit Agreement), which was terminated on the Effective Date. Outstanding letters of credit under the 2004 Credit Agreement in the amount of approximately $253 million were transferred on the Effective Date to the Credit Agreement and remain outstanding thereunder.
The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) to 0.625 to 1.000, and events of default.
The Companys subsidiaries may request letters of credit up to the full amount of the commitment as provided in the Credit Agreement, with all such extensions of credit being guaranteed by the Company. The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company's subsidiary, Newmont USA Limited, a Delaware corporation (Newmont USA), as provided in the Credit Agreement.  Newmont USA may be released from such obligations as a guarantor under the Credit Agreement in the future upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, including if Newmont USA ceases to guarantee the Company's material indebtedness.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Credit Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2011.
