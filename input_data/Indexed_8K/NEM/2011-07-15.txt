ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
As previously disclosed on page 32 in  of Newmont Mining Corporations (the Company) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Newmont Canada Corporation (Newmont Canada), purchased the property, called the Holt-McDermott property (Holt Property), from Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) in October 2004. At that time, Newmont Canada entered into a royalty agreement with Barrick (the Barrick Royalty), allowing Barrick to retain a royalty on the Holt Property. In August 2006, Newmont Canada sold all of its interests in the Holt Property to Holloway Mining Company (Holloway) in exchange for common stock issued by Holloway. In September 2006, Newmont Canada entered into a purchase and sale agreement with St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (St. Andrew) (the 2006 Agreement), under which St. Andrew acquired all the common stock of Holloway. In 2008, Barrick sold its Barrick Royalty to Royal Gold, Inc. (Royal Gold).
Note 26  Commitments and Contingencies
In the court proceedings, St. Andrew alleged that in the 2006 Agreement it only agreed to assume royalty obligations equal to 0.013% of net smelter returns from operations on the Holt Property. Such an interpretation of the 2006 Agreement would make Newmont responsible for any royalties exceeding that amount payable to Royal Gold pursuant to the Barrick Royalty, which is a royalty determined by multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding in favor of St. Andrews interpretation, which Newmont Canada then appealed.
Most recently, during the second quarter of 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the lower court ruling, finding Newmont Canada liable for the sliding scale royalty. There is no cap on the sliding scale royalty and it increases or decreases with the gold price.
The Company is utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the Barrick Royalty liability factoring various changes to gold price and Holt production scenarios into the calculations. The Company determined that it will need to record an accrual of between $160 million and $200 million for the Barrick Royalty at June 30, 2011 and is currently in the process of finalizing its valuation. A $40 million provision for the Barrick Royalty was recorded as part of discontinued operations at December 31, 2010. Therefore, the anticipated charge to discontinued operations in the second quarter is expected to be between $120 million and $160 million on a pre-tax basis. The Company will adjust the liability to fair value when there are significant changes in long-term gold price assumptions or other factors applicable to the model. The Company will record any future changes in the fair value of the Barrick Royalty as discontinued operations on its income statement.
