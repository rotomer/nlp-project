Newmont Announces Second Quarter Net Income From Continuing Operations of $1.06 per Share; Quarterly Dividend Increased 50% to $0.30 per Share
This release should be read in conjunction with Newmont's Second Quarter 2011 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2011 (available at www.newmont.com).
DENVER, July 29, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) ("Newmont" or the "Company") today announced that its second quarter 2011 attributable net income from continuing operations increased 37% to $523 million ($1.06 per share)(1) compared to $382 million ($0.78 per share) in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted net income(2) increased 18% to $445 million ($0.90 per share) in the second quarter of 2011, from $377 million ($0.77 per share) in the second quarter of 2010.
As previously announced, based on the Company's average realized gold price of $1,501 per ounce for the second quarter of 2011, Newmont's Board of Directors approved a third quarter 2011 gold price-linked dividend of $0.30 per share(3), an increase of 50% over the $0.20 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2011, and an increase of 100% over the $0.15 dividend paid in the third quarter of 2010.
Second Quarter Highlights:
Consolidated revenue of $2.4 billion, an increase of 11% from the prior year quarter;
Average realized gold and copper price of $1,501 per ounce and $3.78 per pound, up 25% and 62%, respectively, from the prior year quarter;
Attributable gold and copper production of 1.2 million ounces and 44 million pounds, down 5% and 45%, respectively, from the prior year quarter, impacted by processing lower grade stockpiles at Batu Hijau and lower grade ore at Nevada;
Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $414 million, 45% lower than the prior year quarter due primarily to approximately $300 million in tax payments in Indonesia related to 2010 earnings;
Gold and copper costs applicable to sales ("CAS")of $583 per ounce and $1.34 per pound, respectively ($588 per ounce and $1.41 per pound, respectively, on an attributable basis(4));
Net attributable CAS(4) for gold of $499 per ounce; and
Maintaining 2011 outlook for production, CAS, and capital expenditures.
"We were pleased to announce our third dividend increase in the past twelve months. With our average realized gold price increasing by 25% since the second quarter of last year, our dividend has doubled, highlighting our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders," said Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We were also pleased with our operating performance for the quarter, with gold production consistent with our plans and operating costs trending below expectations. Coupled with the rising gold price, our strong operating performance helped generate a 37% increase in net income from continuing operations for our shareholders."
The Company is maintaining its previously announced 2011 outlook for attributable gold production of 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces at CAS of between $560 and $590 per ounce (on a co-product basis) and 2011 attributable copper production of 190 to 220 million pounds at CAS of between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound. Newmont is maintaining its 2011 attributable capital expenditure outlook of $2.1 to $2.5 billion, or $2.7 to $3.0 billion on a consolidated basis. Capital spending through the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, but expected to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Operations
North America
Attributable gold production at Nevada was 357,000 ounces at CAS of $636 per ounce during the second quarter. Gold production decreased 15% from the prior year quarter due to mining and processing lower grade ore, partially offset by higher mill throughput and leach placement and the commencement of underground mining at Exodus. In addition, open pit ore tons mined increased 47% as the remediation of the Gold Quarry pit slope failure was completed. CAS increased 9% in the second quarter of 2011 from the prior year quarter due to lower production and higher diesel prices, partially offset by higher by-product credits.
Nevada
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production from Nevada of approximately 1.8 to 1.9 million ounces at CAS of between $565 and $615 per ounce.
 Attributable gold production at La Herradura in Mexico was 53,000 ounces at CAS of $514 per ounce during the second quarter. Gold production increased 23% in the second quarter of 2011 from the prior year quarter due to higher leach placement at Soledad and Dipolos. CAS increased 19% due to higher mining, leaching and employee profit sharing costs, partially offset by higher production and by-product credits.
La Herradura
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production from La Herradura of approximately 180,000 to 200,000 ounces at CAS of between $480 and $510 per ounce.
South America
 Attributable gold production at Yanacocha in Peru was 175,000 ounces at CAS of $545 per ounce during the second quarter. Gold production decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2011 from the prior year quarter due to lower leach placement at Yanacocha and La Quinua as a result of mine sequencing and lower equipment availability, partially offset by higher mill grade, throughput and recovery. Ore tons mined decreased 39% due to mine sequencing at El Tapado. CAS increased 40% in the second quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower production combined with higher waste mining, higher diesel prices and labor and royalty costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits and lower workers' participation costs.
Yanacocha
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Yanacocha of approximately 675,000 to 725,000 ounces at CAS of between $500 and $550 per ounce.
 Attributable gold production during the second quarter at La Zanja in Peru was 18,000 ounces.
La Zanja
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at La Zanja of between 40,000 and 50,000 ounces.
Asia Pacific
 Attributable gold and copper production during the second quarter at Boddington in Australia were 205,000 ounces and 16 million pounds, respectively, at CAS of $641 per ounce and $1.94 per pound, respectively. Gold production increased 11% over the prior year quarter due to higher throughput. Copper production increased 7% over the prior year quarter due to higher throughput, partially offset by lower recovery. CAS per ounce of gold and per pound of copper increased 10% and 25%, respectively, over the prior year quarter due to higher conveyor maintenance costs, royalty and power costs, higher diesel prices and a stronger Australian dollar, (net of hedging gains), partially offset by higher production and by-product credits.
Boddington
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Boddington of approximately 750,000 to 800,000 ounces at CAS of between $580 and $620 per ounce, and 2011 attributable copper production of 70 to 80 million pounds at CAS of between $1.80 and $2.20 per pound.
 Attributable gold and copper production during the second quarter at Batu Hijau in Indonesia were 26,000 ounces and 28 million pounds, respectively, at CAS of $490 per ounce and $1.23 per pound, respectively. Gold and copper production decreased 70% and 56% in the second quarter of 2011 from the prior year quarter, respectively, due to lower grade, throughput and recovery as a result of processing stockpiled material as expected, compared to mining high grade Phase 5 ore in the second quarter of 2010. Waste tons mined doubled as Phase 6 waste removal continues as planned. The Company expects Phase 6 ore to become the primary ore feed commencing in late 2013. CAS increased 67% per ounce and 86% per pound, respectively, over the prior year quarter due to lower production and higher waste mining costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits.
Batu Hijau
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production for Batu Hijau of approximately 110,000 to 140,000 ounces at CAS of between $400 and $440 per ounce, while attributable copper production is expected to be approximately 120 to 140 million pounds, at CAS of between $1.10 and $1.30 per pound.
 Attributable gold production during the second quarter in other Australia/New Zealand was 244,000 ounces at CAS of $638 per ounce. Attributable gold production was 5% lower than the prior year quarter due to lower throughput at Tanami and Jundee and a build-up of in-process inventory at Jundee, partially offset by higher throughput at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. CAS were 20% higher than the prior year quarter due to lower production and higher operating costs which were driven by power and diesel prices and a stronger Australian dollar, net of hedging gains.
Other Australia/New Zealand
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at the Other Australia/New Zealand operations of approximately 1.0 to 1.05 million ounces at CAS of between $700 and $770 per ounce.
Africa
 Attributable gold production during the second quarter at Ahafo in Ghana was 146,000 ounces at CAS of $446 per ounce. Gold production increased 11% in the second quarter of 2011 from the prior year quarter due to higher mill ore grade and recovery as a result of mine sequencing. CAS per ounce increased 7% due to higher diesel prices and higher power, labor and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production.
Ahafo
The Company continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Ahafo of approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces at CAS of between $485 and $535 per ounce.
Capital Update
Consolidated capital expenditures were $618 million during the second quarter. Newmont is maintaining its 2011 attributable capital expenditure outlook of $2.1 to $2.5 billion, or $2.7 to $3.0 billion on a consolidated basis. Capital spending through the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, but is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year. For the remainder of the year, 40% of 2011 consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be associated with major project initiatives, including further development of the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada, and the Nevada project portfolio, while the remaining 60% is expected to correspond with growth and sustaining capital.
Supplemental Information
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income
Management uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company's operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill. Management's determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.
Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows:
Costs Applicable to Sales per Ounce/Pound
Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to Newmont basis. Attributable costs applicable to sales are based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of gold or copper production attributable to the non-controlling interest. We include attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.
Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their costs net of the contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure this basis provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers, and to better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold revenues to our cost structure.
