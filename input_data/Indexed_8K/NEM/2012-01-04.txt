Newmont Mining Corporation (the "Company") adopted a revised Executive Change of Control Plan effective January 1, 2012 ("2012 ECOC Plan") for any newly hired eligible employee or any employee promoted into eligible positions, on or after January 1, 2012. Eligibility levels for the 2012 ECOC Plan are Senior Director and above. The 2012 ECOC Plan contains the following material changes from the prior 2005 Executive Change of Control Plan: (i) removal of excise tax gross-up on benefits; (ii) use of target bonus for change of control benefit calculation purposes, rather than the highest bonus paid in the prior 3 years; (iii) removal of company contribution to 401K plan for the change of control benefits period; (iv) removal of actuarial equivalent of non-qualified pension benefit for change of control benefits period; and (v) health benefits continuation period limited to 18 months. For equity grants made in 2012 and going forward, in the case of a qualifying change of control, there shall be no acceleration of equity without a double trigger of a qualifying change of control and termination of employment. A copy of the 2012 ECOC Plan will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Company's upcoming Form 10-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
