Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
As previously disclosed by Newmont Mining Corporation (the "Company") in its most recent Form 10-Q, the Company continues to evaluate development options and economic feasibility for the Hope Bay project, comparatively with other development opportunities within the Company's wider project pipeline. Today, the Company announced care and maintenance funding for the Hope Bay project that will focus on maintaining the highest safety standards, as well as environmental and regulatory compliance for the project. Priorities in the first quarter of 2012 include ensuring regulatory compliance around water, waste and material management, while conserving spending on all non-essential expenditures, including postponing development and surface exploration activities until further evaluation of potential strategic options for the project is complete.
In connection with the Company's regularly scheduled accounting impairment review, the approximate $1.6 billion net book value of the Hope Bay project will be subject to impairment testing, the conclusion of which will be reported in the Company's Form 10-K, expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about February 24, 2012. A write-down, should one be required, will not impact reported operating cash flows, cash balances or proven and probable reserves of the Company. The Hope Bay project was not included as part of the Company's 2017 strategic growth plan or capital expenditure outlook for 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: January 31, 2012
