Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On March 8, 2012, Newmont Mining Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), closed its sale of $2.5 billion senior notes consisting of 3.500% senior notes due 2022 in the principal amount of $1.5 billion (the "2022 Notes"), and 4.875% senior notes due 2042 in the principal amount of $1.0 billion (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2022 Notes, the "Notes").
The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-161915) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately $2,460 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for (i) repayment of the outstanding balance under the Company's senior revolving credit facility (which was drawn upon in January and February 2012 principally to repay the Company's 2012 convertible senior notes and to pay a portion of the payments in connection with the exercise of the early purchase option under the sale-leaseback agreement relating to the Company's refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada), (ii) settlement of certain forward starting swaps contracts, (iii) remaining payments to be made during 2012 in connection with the exercise of the early purchase option under the sale-leaseback agreement relating to the Company's refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada, and (iv) general corporate purposes (which may include funding associated with exploration, the development of the Company's project pipeline or dividends or other forms of capital return to the Company's shareholders). The Company intends to place the remaining proceeds in short-term liquid investments.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 18, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), among the Company, Newmont USA Limited (the "Guarantor") and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 8, 2012 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee. Capitalized terms used in this current report and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2012. The 2022 Notes will mature on March 15, 2022 and the 2042 Notes will mature on March 15, 2042.
The Notes are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' notice by mail, at any time, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Prior to December 15, 2021 (three months prior to the maturity date of the 2022 Notes) in the case of the 2022 Notes and prior to September 15, 2041 (six months prior to the maturity date of the 2042 Notes) in the case of the 2042 Notes, the Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts:
 
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the Redemption Date.
 
At any time on or after December 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the 2022 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price calculated by the Company equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2022 Notes to the Redemption Date. At any time on or after September 15, 2041 (six months prior to their maturity date), the 2042 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price calculated by the Company equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2042 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2042 Notes to the Redemption Date.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless all Notes have been called for redemption as described above, each Holder of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Notes at an offer price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment.
The Notes are the Company's unsecured obligations and will rank equally with the Company's existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to the Company's future subordinated debt. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantor. The guarantees for the Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantor and rank equally with other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor that is currently outstanding or that it may issue in the future. The guarantees will be released if the Guarantor ceases to guarantee more than $75 million of other debt of the Company.
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants. Under certain events of default, including, without limitation, failure to pay when due any principal amount or certain cross defaults to other agreements or instruments, occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the series of Note may declare the principal of such Note and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration immediately due and payable. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or the Guarantor, the principal amount of the Notes and accrued interest automatically become due and payable.
The foregoing description of the issuance and sale of the Notes and the terms thereof does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Base Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. The forms of 2022 Note and 2042 Note, which are included as part of the Second Supplemental Indenture, are filed as Exhibits 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The forms of guaranty for the 2022 Note and the 2042 Note, which are also included as part of the Second Supplemental Indenture, are filed as Exhibits 4.5 and 4.6, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking and/or investment banking transactions with the Company and its affiliates, for which they have received, and in the future expect to receive, customary compensation. In addition, affiliates of the underwriters from time to time have acted or in the future may continue to act as lenders to the Company and its affiliates, for which they have received or expect to receive customary compensation.
Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under the Company's senior revolving credit facility and borrowings under that facility are being repaid with the proceeds of the sale of the Notes. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are counterparties to the swaps that will be settled with the proceeds of the sale of the Notes.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any "issuer information" relating to this offering filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or any Pricing Disclosure Package (including any Pricing Disclosure Package that has subsequently been amended), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, their respective directors, officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred) that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Pricing Disclosure Package, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession figure appearing in the second paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" and the information contained in the fifth paragraph and the second sentence of the sixth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting".
Indemnification of the Company and the Guarantor.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company and the Guarantor, their respective directors, officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company or the Guarantor shall be designated in writing by the Company.
Notice and Procedures.
provided
provided
further
 
The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Guarantor or by the Underwriters, respectively, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
(e) The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
 
exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantor shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in clearance or settlement systems shall have occurred; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
Termination
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by themselves, the non-defaulting Underwriters or by other persons reasonably satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. If, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives shall have arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company shall have arranged for the purchase of such Securities, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of the Company or the Representatives may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement relating to such purpose, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters, the Representatives and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remain unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate
 
principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of such Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company and the Guarantor, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company, the Guarantor or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11.

(b) If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason permitted under this Agreement other than because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of Section 9 hereof, the occurrence of any event specified in Section 10 hereof or the occurrence of any event specified in paragraph (h) of Section 6 hereof, the Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby, but the Company and the Guarantor shall be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 7 hereof.
 
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
