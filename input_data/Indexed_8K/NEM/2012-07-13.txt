Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (an "Order") issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"). Additionally, effective January 27, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules amending Form 8-K by adding Item 1.04 for Mine Safety disclosures in accordance with the Act. This Current Report is being provided in compliance with such rules.
On July 11, 2012, Newmont USA Limited (the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation, received a verbal Order by an MSHA inspector stating that an employee was observed working on the top of a haul truck parked in the Carlin South Area Mine maintenance shop bay without wearing fall protective devices. The employee immediately ceased work and exited the haul truck without incident, which terminated the Order.
The conditions cited in the Order referred to above did not result in accidents or injury and had no material adverse impact on the Company's operations at the Carlin Mine.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
