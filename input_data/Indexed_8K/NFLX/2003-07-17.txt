On April 17, 2003, Netflix, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003. The press release, which has been attached as Exhibit 99.1 discloses certain financial measures, in particular, Non-GAAP net income and free cash flow, that may be considered Non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes that Non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

LOS GATOS, CAJuly 17, 2003Netflix, Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) announced strong financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. According to Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix, "The consumers' love affair with the subscription rental model we pioneered at Netflix enabled us to once again achieve record results in the current quarter."
 
Revenue, Subscribers, and Churn
 
Total revenue for the second quarter was a record $63.2 million, up 74 percent compared to $36.4 million for the second quarter 2002, and up 14 percent compared to $55.7 million for the first quarter 2003.
 
Netflix ended the second quarter of 2003 with approximately 1,147,000 total subscribers. During the quarter Netflix acquired 327,000 new trial subscribers, a 39 percent year-over-year increase from the 236,000 new trial subscribers acquired in the second quarter of 2002 and a sequential decrease of 22 percent from the 417,000 new trial subscribers acquired in the first quarter of 2003.
 
Average monthly subscriber churn
1
for the second quarter of 2003 was 5.6 percent as compared to 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2002 and 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 2003. Churn includes free trial subscribers as well as paying subscribers who elect not to renew their monthly subscription service during the quarter.
 
Gross Margin
 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 44.2 percent, down from 46.1 percent in the first quarter of 2003. Gross margin declined in the second quarter due to rising content costs which increased by 2 percent of revenue. Increased depreciation expense on purchased inventory accounted for the increase in content costs. Disc usage per average paid subscriber was unchanged in the quarter.
 
Subscriber Acquisition Cost
 
Subscriber acquisition cost
2
for the second quarter was $30.45 per new-trial subscriber compared to a cost of $34.13 for the second quarter of 2002 and a cost of $31.67 for the first quarter of 2003.
 
GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Net Income, and Free Cash Flow
 
Netflix reported GAAP net income of $3.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003 compared to a GAAP net loss of $13.1 million, or $1.28 per
 
diluted share, for the second quarter of 2002 and GAAP net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003.
 
Non-GAAP net income was $5.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003 compared to a Non-GAAP net income of $12 thousand, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2002 and Non-GAAP net income of $31 thousand, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003.

Free cash flow for the second quarter 2003 was $4.3 million or 7 percent of revenue, down 7 percent from $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2002 and down 21 percent compared to $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, the Company generated $20.3 million of free cash flow and finished the second quarter with $116.3 million of cash and short-term investments. Less outstanding debt of $1.1 million, this equates to net cash of $115.2 million or $3.74 per diluted share. Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows used in investing activities excluding purchases and sales of short-term investments. Cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter 2003 was $23.6 million, up 191 percent from $8.1 million in the second quarter 2002 and up 84 percent compared to $12.8 million for the first quarter of 2003.
 
Adoption of SFAS No. 123
 
As previously announced on June 9, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, for stock-based employee compensation during the second quarter of 2003. The Company elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under SFAS No. 148 and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 been applied.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Management believes that Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the GAAP equivalents of these Non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
