Press release dated October 15, 2003 by Netflix, Inc.
 
Item 12.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
The information provided in this Report is being furnished under Item 12 of Form 8-K and in accordance with SEC release 33-8216.
 
On October 15, 2003, Netflix, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. The press release, which has been attached as Exhibit 99.1, discloses certain financial measures, in particular, non-GAAP net income and free cash flow, that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measures.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

LOS GATOS, CA  October 15, 2003  Netflix, Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) announced record financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003. "This record quarter and the consistent, steady progress we've made as a public company shows the power of our business model and its ability to scale as our subscriber base grows," said Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix. "Service improvements continue to fuel our evangelical grassroots marketing efforts and to push retention to an all-time high."
 
Revenue, Subscribers, and Churn
 
Total revenue for the third quarter was a record $72.2 million, up 77 percent compared to $40.7 million for the third quarter 2002, and up 14 percent compared to $63.2 million for the second quarter 2003.
 
Netflix ended the third quarter of 2003 with approximately 1,291,000 total subscribers, up 144,000 or 13% sequentially. During the quarter Netflix acquired 383,000 new trial subscribers, a 38 percent year-over-year increase from the 277,000 new trial subscribers acquired in the third quarter of 2002 and a sequential increase of 17 percent from the 327,000 new trial subscribers acquired in the second quarter of 2003.

Average monthly subscriber churn
1
for the third quarter of 2003 was 5.2 percent as compared to 7.2 percent in the third quarter of 2002 and 5.6 percent in the second quarter of 2003. Churn improved across the subscriber base during the quarter in response to steady improvements in the quality of the Netflix service. Churn includes free trial subscribers as well as paying subscribers who elect not to renew their monthly subscription service during the quarter.
 
Gross Margin
 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 46.5 percent, up from 44.2 percent in the second quarter of 2003. Gross margin increased in the third quarter due to lower than expected content costs. Disc usage per average paid subscriber increased slightly during the quarter.
 
Subscriber Acquisition Cost
 
Subscriber acquisition cost

for the third quarter was $31.81 per new-trial subscriber compared to a cost of $33.57 for the third quarter of 2002 and a cost of $30.45 for the second quarter of 2003. The Company continues to benefit from rapid growth in word of mouth as an acquisition source.

Monthly churn is defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions, divided by three months. This is the same churn definition as previously given but restated in plain-English for clarity.
 
GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), and Free Cash Flow
 
Netflix reported GAAP net income of $3.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2003 compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2002 and GAAP net income of $3.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003.
 
Non-GAAP net income was $6.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2003 compared to a Non-GAAP net loss of $228 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2002 and Non-GAAP net income of $5.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003. Non-GAAP net income (loss) equals net income (loss) on a GAAP basis before stock-based compensation expense.
 
Free cash flow for the third quarter 2003 was $7.9 million or 11 percent of revenue, up 36 percent from $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2002 and up 82 percent compared to $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2003. This is the Company's eighth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2003, the Company generated $22.3 million of free cash flow and finished the third quarter with $124.4 million of cash and short-term investments. Less outstanding debt of $0.6 million, this equates to net cash of $123.8 million or $3.94 per diluted share. Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows used in investing activities excluding purchases and sales of short-term investments. Cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter 2003 was $22.0 million, up 99 percent from $11.1 million in the third quarter 2002 and down 7 percent compared to $23.6 million for the second quarter of 2003.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Management believes that Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity

because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the GAAP equivalents of these Non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
