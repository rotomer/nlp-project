Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On April 21, 2005, Netflix, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The press release, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, discloses certain financial measures that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information is presented using consistent methodology from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
 
The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statement and Exhibits.
 
 
99.1    Press release dated April 21, 2005 by Netflix, Inc.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005.
Los Gatos, Calif.  April 21, 2005
 
For the first quarter:
 
 
 
 
"On a highly competitive playing field, our performance in the first quarter was strong across all key operating aspects of the business," said Reed Hastings, the company's co-founder and CEO. "We added subscribers at a quick and cost effective pace and we minimized customer churn in the face of heavy promotion and deep discounting by our competition. Looking out over the balance of 2005, we believe consumers will continue to respond enthusiastically to our service and we expect to hit our target of four million subscribers by year's end."
 
First-Quarter 2005 Financial Highlights
 
for the first quarter of 2005 was a record $154.1 million, representing 54 percent year-over-year growth from $100.4 million for the first quarter of 2004, and 7 percent quarter-over-quarter growth from $143.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.
Revenue
 
for the first quarter of 2005 was $8.8 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5.8 million, or $0.11 per share, for the first quarter of 2004 and GAAP net income of $5.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004. Management had guided to a GAAP net loss for the first quarter of $16 to $19 million.

for the first quarter of 2005 was 38.4 percent compared to 43.6 percent for the first quarter of 2004 and 45.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2004. The sequential decline in gross margin reflects the first full quarterly impact of the price reduction implemented in November of 2004.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the GAAP equivalents of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
