Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On July 25, 2005, Netflix, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. The press release, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, discloses certain financial measures that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information is presented using consistent methodology from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
 
The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statement and Exhibits.
 
(c) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005.
Los Gatos, Calif.  July 25, 2005
 
For the second quarter:
 
 
 
 
"Our business performed impressively across all key operating measures in the second quarter, reflecting the broadening consumer appeal of our service and the rising competitive strength of our organization," said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and chief executive officer. "Looking at the second half of 2005, we're confident of hitting four million subscribers by year's end and expect to reach that milestone profitably and as the clear-cut market leader."
 
Second-Quarter 2005 Financial Highlights
 
for the second quarter of 2005 was a record $164.5 million, representing 37 percent year-over-year growth from $120.3 million for the second quarter of 2004, and 7 percent quarter-over-quarter growth from $154.1 million for the first quarter of 2005.
Revenue
 
for the second quarter of 2005 was $5.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $2.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2004 and a GAAP net loss of $8.8 million, or $0.17 per share, for the first quarter of 2005. Management had guided to a GAAP net loss for the second quarter of $2.2 million to $7.2 million. The outperformance is due to a number of factors including: lower-than-expected marketing, better-than-expected cost management as well as lower than expected stock-based compensation expense.
GAAP net income
 
was $9.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2005, compared to non-GAAP net income of $7.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2004 and non-GAAP net loss of $4.5 million, or $0.09 per share, for the first quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income (loss) equals net income (loss) on a GAAP basis before stock-based compensation expense.
Non-GAAP net income
for the second quarter of 2005 was 39.0 percent compared to 42.0 percent for the second quarter of 2004 and 38.4 percent for the first quarter of 2005.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the GAAP equivalents of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
