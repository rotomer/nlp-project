Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Annual Salaries and Equity Compensation for Named Executive Officers
 
The Board of Directors of the Registrant established the annual salaries and monthly stock option allowances for 2006 for the Registrant's Named Executive Officers as follows:
 
 
The number of stock options to be granted monthly shall be determined by the following formula: the grantee's stock option allowance / ([Fair Market Value on the date of grant] * 0.25). Each monthly grant shall be made on the first trading day of the month, shall be fully vested upon grant and shall be exercisable at a strike price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Registrant's 2002 Stock Plan) on the date of grant. The options will be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2002 Stock Plan and will be administered on a non-discretionary basis by the Stock Option Committee of the Registrant's Board of Directors, provided that only the Board may change the amount or terms of future grants. Registrant does not currently provide a program of performance bonuses for its Named Executive Officers.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
