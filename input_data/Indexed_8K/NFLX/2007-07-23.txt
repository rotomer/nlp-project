On July 23, 2007, Netflix, Inc. (the "Company") announced its financial results for the quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2007. The press release, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, discloses certain financial measures that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information is presented using consistent methodology from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
The press-release will be attached as Exhibit 99.1

Exhibit 99.1
 
 Netflix, Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
LOS GATOS, Calif., July 23, 2007
"As expected, second-quarter revenue and subscriber growth reflected the impact of intense competition, as we delivered subscribers and revenue at the low end of our guidance range, even while achieving near record net income," said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and chief executive officer.
"Online DVD rental is a large and attractive opportunity and we remain committed to investing in our long-term growth. With yesterday's price cuts in two of our most popular subscription plans, together with the reductions in February and June, we are choosing to lower price and reduce marketing as the most efficient means of sub growth and retention in the current competitive environment, and we are lowering our full-year guidance for revenue, subscribers, and earnings accordingly."
Second-Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights
for the second quarter of 2007 was $303.7 million, representing 27 percent year-over-year growth from $239.4 million for the second quarter of 2006, and 1 percent sequential decline from $305.3 million for the first quarter of 2007.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Management believes that non-GAAP net income is a useful measure of operating performance because it excludes the non-cash impact of stock option accounting, and, where specified, excludes the net settlement gain related to the patent lawsuit settlement. In addition, management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity because it excludes the non-operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short-term investments and cash flows from financing activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the GAAP equivalents of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
