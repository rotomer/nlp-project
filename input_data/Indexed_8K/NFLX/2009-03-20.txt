On March 18, 2009, the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") approved amending and restating its Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended and restated to date, the "Bylaws"), effective immediately, to set forth more explicitly the processes that stockholders must follow and to specify additional information that stockholders must provide when proposing director nominations and other business in light of the increased usage of more complex voting/ownership arrangements. As amended, the Bylaws are intended to better assure that stockholders and Netflix have a reasonable opportunity to consider nominations and other business proposed to be brought before a meeting of stockholders or to be proposed for a special meeting of stockholders and to allow for full information to be distributed to stockholders. The amendments also update the notification methods for calling special meetings of the Board of Directors and include such methods as e-mail notification. The amendments also eliminate the requirement that the Board specifically authorize signatories for corporate checks as well as the requirement that the Board hold or otherwise schedule a first meeting following the annual meeting.
A copy of the Bylaws is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.1
REGISTERED OFFICE
The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.
1.2
OTHER OFFICES
The Board of Directors of the corporation (the "Board") may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
2.1
PLACE OF MEETINGS
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, as designated by the Board. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation.
2.2
ANNUAL MEETING
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board. At the annual meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.
2.3
SPECIAL MEETING
Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time only by the Board acting pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Whole Board (as defined below), the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or by the President. Only such business shall be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been stated in the notice for such meeting. The term "Whole Board" shall mean the total number of authorized directors of the corporation whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.
2.4
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS; EXCEPTION TO REQUIREMENTS OF NOTICE
All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting (as authorized by the Board in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware), and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and, unless the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time (as so amended and restated, the "Certificate") provides otherwise, any special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled by resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Board members then in office upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
Whenever notice is required to be given, under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate or these Bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate or these Bylaws, to any stockholder to whom (a) notice of two (2) consecutive annual meetings, or (b) all, and at least two (2) payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a twelve (12) month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at such person's address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required. Any actions or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and
 
effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth such person's then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
The exception in subsection (a) of the above paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission.
2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his, her or its address as it appears on the records of the corporation and otherwise is given when delivered. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6
QUORUM
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or the Certificate. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then a majority of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof, and the means of remote communications, in any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting (as authorized by the Board in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware), are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) calendar days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
 
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The Chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these Bylaws.
2.8
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Except as otherwise provided in the provisions of Section 213 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the fixing of a date for determination of stockholders of record), or as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate, each stockholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
In all matters, other than the election of directors and except as otherwise required by law, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.
2.9
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, or any waiver by electronic transmission, unless so required by the Certificate or these Bylaws.
2.10
NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders.
 
2.11
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which such date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board and which such date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) calendar days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the Board does not so fix a record date:
(a) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(b) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
2.12
PROXIES
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or it by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the Secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or it as proxy in the manner(s) provided under Section 212(c) of the General Corporate Law of Delaware or as otherwise provided under Delaware law. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE; STOCK LEDGER
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) calendar days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) for a period of at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the meeting during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation.
 
In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to the stockholders of the corporation. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
2.14
ADVANCE NOTICE PROCEDURES
(i) Advance Notice of Stockholder Business. At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be brought: (A) pursuant to the corporation's proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (B) by or at the direction of the Board, or (C) by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.14(i) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(i). In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these Bylaws and applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (C) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders.
(a) To comply with clause (C) of Section 2.14(i) above, a stockholder's notice must set forth all information required under this Section 2.14(i) and must be timely received by the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the forty fifth (45
th
) calendar day nor earlier than the seventy fifth (75
th
) calendar day before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) for the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) calendar days prior to or delayed by more than sixty (60) calendar days after the one-year anniversary of the date of the previous year's annual meeting, then, for notice by the stockholder to be timely, it must be so received by the secretary not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120
th
) calendar day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the ninetieth (90
th
) calendar day prior to such annual meeting, or (ii) the tenth (10
th
) calendar day following the day on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of such annual meeting is first made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this Section 2.14(i)(a). "Public Announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the "1934 Act").
 
(b) To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth as to each matter of business the stockholder intends to bring before the annual meeting: (1) a brief description of the business intended to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (2) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), (3) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are held of record or are beneficially owned by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person, (4) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit from share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the corporation, (5) any material interest of the stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person in such business, and (6) a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (1) through (6), a "Business Solicitation Statement"). In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be supplemented not later than ten (10) calendar days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (3) and (4) above as of the record date. For purposes of this Section 2.14, a "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (i) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made, or (iii) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii).
(c) Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 2.14(i) and, if applicable, Section 2.14(ii). In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The chairperson of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting and in accordance with the provisions prescribed by these Bylaws, including this Section 2.14(i), and, if the chairperson should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the annual meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the annual meeting shall not be conducted.
 
(ii) Advance Notice of Director Nominations at Annual Meetings. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(ii) shall be eligible for election or re-election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. Nominations of persons for election to the Board shall be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) by or at the direction of the Board or (B) by a stockholder of the corporation who (1) was a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.14(ii) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(ii). In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.

(b) To be in proper written form, such stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth:
(1) as to each person (a "nominee") whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of the nominee, (B) the principal occupation or employment of the nominee, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are held of record or are beneficially owned by the nominee and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the nominee, (D) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of the nominee with respect to any securities of the corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of the nominee, (E) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (F) a written statement executed by the nominee acknowledging that as a director of the corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under Delaware law with respect to the corporation and its stockholders, and (G) any other information relating to the nominee that would be required to be disclosed about such nominee if proxies were being solicited for the election of the nominee as a director, or that is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation the nominee's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and
 
(2) as to such stockholder giving notice, (A) the information required to be provided pursuant to clauses (2) through (5) of Section 2.14(i)(b) above, and the supplement referenced in the second sentence of Section 2.14(i)(b) above (except that the references to "business" in such clauses shall instead refer to nominations of directors for purposes of this paragraph), and (B) a statement whether either such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a number of the corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person to be necessary to elect such nominee(s) (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) and (B) above, a "Nominee Solicitation Statement").
(c) At the request of the Board, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director must furnish to the secretary of the corporation (1) that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination of such person as a director as of a date subsequent to the date on which the notice of such person's nomination was given and (2) such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee; in the absence of the furnishing of such information if requested, such stockholder's nomination shall not be considered in proper form pursuant to this Section 2.14(ii).
(d) Without exception, no person shall be eligible for election or re-election as a director of the corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 2.14(ii). In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The chairperson of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the annual meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions prescribed by these Bylaws, and if the chairperson should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the annual meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
(iii) Advance Notice of Director Nominations for Special Meetings.
(a) For a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to Section 2.3, nominations of persons for election to the Board shall be made only (1) by or at the direction of the Board or (2) by any stockholder of the corporation who (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice required by this Section 2.14(iii) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting and (B) delivers a timely written notice of the nomination to the secretary of the corporation that includes the information set forth in Sections 2.14(ii)(b) and (ii)(c)
 
above. To be timely, such notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90
th
) calendar day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10
th
) calendar day following the day on which Public Announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) by a stockholder in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(iii). In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(b) The chairperson of the special meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination or business was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if the chairperson should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination or business shall be disregarded.
(iv) Other Requirements and Rights. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.14, including, with respect to business such stockholder intends to bring before the annual meeting that involves a proposal that such stockholder requests to be included in the corporation's proxy statement, the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act. Nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to affect any right of the corporation to omit a proposal from the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act.
2.15
ORGANIZATION
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by (a) the Chairman of the Board or, in the absence thereof, (b) such person as the Chairman of the Board shall appoint or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the Chairman of the Board shall fail to make such appointment, (c) such person as the Chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall appoint or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the Chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the Board. In the absence of the Secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the Chairman of the meeting appoints.
The Board shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one (1) or more inspector(s), who may include individual(s) who serve the corporation in other capacities, including without limitation as officers, employees or agents, to act at the meeting of stockholders and make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one (1) or more persons as alternate inspector(s) to replace any inspector, who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed or is able to
 
act at a meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the meeting shall appoint one (1) or more inspector(s) to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector(s) or alternate(s) shall have the duties prescribed pursuant to Section 231 of the General Corporate Laws of Delaware or other applicable law.
The Board shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.

2.16
NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (a) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (b) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
Notice given pursuant to the above paragraph shall be deemed given (a) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting, and (ii) the giving of such separate notice, and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. This Section 2.16 shall not apply to Section 164 (failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (attachment of shares of stock) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
3.1
POWERS
The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. In addition to the power and authorities these Bylaws expressly confer upon them, the Board may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not required by statute, the Certificate or these Bylaws to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
3.2
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS; TERM OF OFFICE
Subject to the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock of the corporation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Board members then in office.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before such director's term of office expires.

ELECTION AND QUALIFICATION OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in the Certificate or Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, directors shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three (3) classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, one (1) class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2003, another class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2004, and another class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2005, with each class to hold office until its successor is duly elected and qualified. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, commencing with the first annual meeting (a) directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, and (b) if authorized by a resolution of the Board, directors may be elected to fill any vacancy on the Board, regardless of how such vacancy shall have been created (as set forth in Section 3.4 below).

Elections of directors at all meetings of the stockholders at which directors are to be elected shall be by ballot and, subject to the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock of the corporation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, a plurality of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors. The ballot shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting or such other information as may be required under the procedure established by the Chairman of the meeting. If authorized by the Board, such requirement of a ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic submission was authorized.

6.1
RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (collectively, a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation (or any predecessor), or is or was serving at the request of the corporation (or any predecessor) as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (or any predecessor of such entities), including service with respect to an employee benefit plan maintained or sponsored by the corporation (or any predecessor) (collectively, an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 6.3 below with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
6.2
RIGHT TO ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES
In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 6.1, an Indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending against any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an "Advancement of Expenses"), such Advancement to be paid by the corporation within twenty (20) calendar days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement(s) from the Indemnitee requesting such Advancement of Expenses from time to time; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of Delaware requires, the payment of an Advancement of Expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including without limitation service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (an "Undertaking"), by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified for such Expenses under this Section 6.2 or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses conferred in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall be contract rights.
 
6.3
RIGHT OF INDEMNITEE TO BRING SUIT
To obtain indemnification or Advancement of Expenses under this Article VI, an Indemnitee shall submit to the corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or Advancement of Expenses. Upon such written request, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the Indemnitee, by Independent Counsel (as defined below); or (b) if no request is made by the Indemnitee for a determination by Independent Counsel, (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as defined below), or (ii) if a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; or (c) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification or Advancement of Expenses is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the Indemnitee, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, unless there shall have occurred within two (2) years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or Advancement of Expenses is claimed a Change of Control (as defined below), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board. If it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or Advancement of Expenses, payment to the Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) calendar days after such determination.
If a claim under Section 6.1 or 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) calendar days after a written claim has been received by the corporation as set forth above, except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses where the required Undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such Expenses upon a determination that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board, a committee of the Board, Independent Counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporate Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation
 
(including its Board, a committee of the Board, Independent Counsel or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the corporation to recover and Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, shall be on the corporation.
6.4
NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS
If a determination shall have been made pursuant to this Article VI that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or Advancement of Expenses, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 6.3 above. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 6.3 above that the procedures and presumptions of these Bylaws are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article VI.
The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Certificate, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of this Article VI shall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.
If any provision(s) of Article VI of these Bylaws shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reasons whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of such Article shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
6.5
INSURANCE
The corporation may maintain insurance to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
6.6
INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS OF THE CORPORATION
The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the indemnification and Advancement of Expenses of directors and officers of the corporation.

The Board, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation. Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.3
STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES
The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board may provide by resolution that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board, or the President or Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
8.4
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one (1) class of stock or more than one (1) series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock
 
a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.5
LOST CERTIFICATES
Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require, or may require any transfer agent, if any, for the shares to require, the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his, her or its legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
8.6
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the Delaware General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these Bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person.
8.7
DIVIDENDS
The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in the Certificate, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock pursuant to the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of the corporation's capital stock.
The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies.
8.8
FISCAL YEAR
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board and may be changed by resolution of the Board.
 
8.9
SEAL
This corporation may have a corporate seal, which may be adopted or altered at the pleasure of the Board, and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.
8.10
TRANSFER OF STOCK
Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation, if any, of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer (as determined by legal counsel to the corporation), it shall be the duty of the corporation, as the corporation may so instruct its transfer agent, if any, to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.
8.11
REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS
The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
The Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the Board. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or by the Certificate, the amendment or repeal of all or any portion of Article II, Section 3.2 (number of directors), Section 3.3 (election, qualification and term of office of directors), Section 3.4 (resignation and vacancies), Section 3.15 (removal of directors), Article VI or this Article IX by the stockholders of the corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
 
The undersigned hereby certifies that he is the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of Netflix, Inc. and that the foregoing Amended and Restated Bylaws, comprising 29 pages, were adopted as the Bylaws of the corporation on March 18, 2009 by the Board of Directors of the corporation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has hereunto set his hand and affixed the corporate seal on March 18, 2009.
