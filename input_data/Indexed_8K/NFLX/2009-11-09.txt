On November 6, 2009, Netflix, Inc. (the "Company") issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.50% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (the "Initial Purchasers").
The terms and conditions of the Notes, the Indenture (as defined below) and the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) described in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K are incorporated herein by reference.
 
In connection with the Notes Offering (as defined below), the Company repaid all outstanding amounts under and terminated its Credit Agreement, dated as of September 16, 2009, by and among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as agent for the lenders.
The Credit Agreement provided for a $100 million revolving line of credit, with a $10 million letter of credit subfacility, terminating September 16, 2012. Loans accrued interest, at the Company's option, at a base rate determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement, plus a spread of 1.75% to 2.25%, or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 2.75% to 3.25%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the ratio of total debt to EBITDA for the preceding four quarter period.
The Credit Agreement contained customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding reporting requirements, maintenance of insurance, maintenance of properties and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Further, the Credit Agreement contained customary negative covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, among other things, to grant liens, make investments, incur debt, make certain restricted payments or sell, transfer or dispose of assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
 
On November 3, 2009, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. to sell to the Initial Purchasers the Notes (the "Notes Offering"). On November 6, 2009, the Notes Offering was completed and the Company issued to the Initial Purchasers $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The net proceeds to the Company from the Notes Offering were approximately $194 million.
In connection with the Notes Offering, the Company entered into an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 6, 2009, among the Company, the guarantors from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
Certain terms and conditions of the Notes, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) are as follows:
The Notes mature on November 15, 2017.
Maturity.
The Notes accrue interest of 8.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is paid semi-annually on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2010.
Interest.
The Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes rank senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future liabilities of the Company that are not so subordinated. The Notes rank effectively junior to all secured obligations of the Company, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations, and all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company's subsidiaries that are not guarantors.
Ranking.
 
The Notes are not initially guaranteed by any subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, the Notes may be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the Company's existing and future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries. Such subsidiary guarantors are collectively referred to herein as the "subsidiary guarantors," and such subsidiary guarantees are collectively referred to herein as the "subsidiary guarantees." Each subsidiary guarantee would rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor, would rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of such subsidiary guarantor not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the guarantee, and would be effectively subordinated to all of such subsidiary guarantor's secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt.
Guarantees.
At any time prior to November 15, 2013, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after November 15, 2013, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at certain redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time and from time to time prior to November 15, 2012, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the Company from certain equity offerings at a price equal to 108.50% , plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that the redemption occurs no later than the 120
Optional Redemption.
th
day after the closing of the related equity offering, and at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately thereafter.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain asset sales, the Company must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 100%, in the case of an asset sale, or 101%, in the case of a change of control, of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
Mandatory Repurchase.
The Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's restricted subsidiaries to:

(g) default with respect to any indebtedness for borrowed money of, or guaranteed by, the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries, which default results in the acceleration of any such indebtedness and is not rescinded or cured within 30 days after such acceleration and the principal amount of such indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated and remains undischarged after such 30 day period, aggregates $15.0 million or more;
(f) the Company's or any of its restricted subsidiaries' failure to make any payment at maturity, including any applicable grace period, in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of, or guaranteed by, the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries, and the principal amount of such indebtedness together with any other such indebtedness under which there has been a payment default, aggregates $15.0 million or more;

(e) The amount of Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (1) the accreted value thereof, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, (2) the principal amount thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness, (3) in the case of the guarantee by the specified Person of any Indebtedness of any other Person, the maximum liability to which the specified Person may be subject upon the occurrence of the contingency giving rise to the obligation and (4) in the case of Indebtedness of others guaranteed by means of a Lien on any asset of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, the lesser of (A) the fair market value of such asset on the date on which Indebtedness is required to be determined pursuant to this Indenture and (B) the amount of the Indebtedness so secured.
(f) For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; that if such Indebtedness is incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such Refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being Refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.09, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer may incur pursuant to this Section 4.09 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being Refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such Refinancing.

A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
SECTION 6.04.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Trustee, may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under this Indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or principal of, the Notes. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose hereof; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 6.05.
Control by Majority.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all the Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with the law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
SECTION 6.06.
Limitation on Suits.
A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if
(a) the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
(b) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(c) such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer and the provision of indemnity; and
(e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders).
SECTION 6.07.
Rights of Holders of Notes To Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder of the Note.
SECTION 6.08.
Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuer for the whole amount of principal of, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
SECTION 6.09.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Notes), the Issuer's creditors or the Issuer's property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of a Note to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of the Notes, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder of a Note thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Note in any such proceeding.

Third: to the Issuer or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct in writing.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes.
SECTION 6.11.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party
 
litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes pursuant to this Article 6.

However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective.

The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuer in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.

SECTION 9.06.
Trustee To Sign Amendments, Etc.
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modification thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall receive, and shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Guarantee would constitute or result in a violation of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or similar law of any relevant jurisdiction, the liability of the applicable Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be reduced to the maximum amount permissible under such fraudulent conveyance or similar law.
The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor hereunder based on the net assets of each other Guarantor determined in accordance with GAAP. The preceding sentence shall in no way affect the rights of the Holders of Notes to the benefits hereof, the Notes or the Guarantees.
pro rata
Nothing in this Section 10.01 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.07 hereof. Nothing contained in this Section 10.01 or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees shall impair, as between any Guarantor and the Holder of any Note, the obligation of such Guarantor, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to the Holder thereof the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Guarantee and this Indenture, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law or hereunder or thereunder upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.

Payment Default
(g) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), which default results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity not rescinded or cured within 30 days after such acceleration, and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated and remains undischarged after such 30 day period, aggregates $15.0 million or more;

(i) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be held in a judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor that qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary, or any person acting on behalf of any Guarantor that qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary, shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under its Guarantee;

The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in such Holders' interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer so elects, the sole remedy of the Holders for a failure to comply with any obligations the Issuer may have or is deemed to have pursuant to TIA  314(a)(1) or the Issuer's failure to comply with Section 4.03 of the Indenture will for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the Notes at a rate per annum: (i) equal to 0.25% for the first 90 days after the occurrence of such failure and (ii) equal to 0.50% from the 91st day to, and including, the 180th day after the occurrence of such failure, which for purposes of this paragraph is referred to as "."

On the 181st day after such failure (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), such failure will then constitute an Event of Default without any further notice or lapse of time and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
additional interest
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all the Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have
 
been cured or waived. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Trustee, may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or principal of, the Notes.

Registration Under the Securities Act
(a) To the extent not prohibited by any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, the Company and any Guarantor shall use their reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be filed an Exchange Offer Registration Statement covering an offer to the Holders to exchange all the Registrable Securities for Exchange Securities and (ii) have such Registration Statement remain effective until the earlier of 180 days after the last Exchange Date and the date that the Participating Broker-Dealers are no longer required to deliver a prospectus under the Securities Act for use by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers. The Company and any Guarantor shall commence the Exchange Offer promptly after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC and use their reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer not later than 60 days after such effective date. The Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been "completed" upon the delivery by the Company to the registrar under the Indenture of Exchange Securities in the same aggregate principal amount as the aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities that were validly tendered (and not withdrawn) by Holders (other than Restricted Holders) thereof pursuant to and prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer.
The Company and any Guarantor shall commence the Exchange Offer by mailing the related Prospectus, appropriate letters of transmittal and other accompanying documents to each Holder stating, in addition to such other disclosures as are required by applicable law, substantially the following:
(i) that the Exchange Offer is being made pursuant to this Agreement and that all Registrable Securities validly tendered and not properly withdrawn will be accepted for exchange;
(ii) the dates of acceptance for exchange (which shall be a period of at least 20 Business Days from the date such notice is mailed) (the "Exchange Dates");
(iii) that any Registrable Security not tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest but will not retain any rights under this Agreement, except as otherwise specified herein;
(iv) that any Holder electing to have a Registrable Security exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be required to (A) surrender such Registrable Security, together with the appropriate letters of transmittal, to the institution and at the address (located in the United States) and in the manner specified in the notice, or (B) effect such exchange otherwise in compliance with the applicable procedures of the depositary for such Registrable Security, in each case prior to the close of business on the last Exchange Date; and
 
(v) that any Holder will be entitled to withdraw its election, not later than the close of business on the last Exchange Date, by (A) sending to the institution and at the address (located in the United States) specified in the notice, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities delivered for exchange and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Securities exchanged or (B) effecting such withdrawal in compliance with the applicable procedures of the depositary for the Registrable Securities.
As a condition to participating in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be required to represent to the Company and any Guarantor that (i) any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) it has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities, (iii) it is not an "affiliate" (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or any Guarantor, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Registrable Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities and not directly from the Company, then such Holder will deliver a Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available a Prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities (any Holder that does not satisfy each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), a "Restricted Holder").
As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the Company and any Guarantor shall:
(i) accept for exchange Registrable Securities or portions thereof validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and
(ii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Securities or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the Company and issue, and cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and deliver to each Holder, Exchange Securities equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities tendered by such Holder.
The Company and any Guarantor shall use their reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff.
(b) In the event that (i) the Company and any Guarantor determine that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any
 
other reason completed by June 4, 2010 or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a "Shelf Request") from any Initial Purchaser representing that it holds Registrable Securities that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Company and any Guarantor shall use their reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective.
In the event that the Company and any Guarantor are required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company and any Guarantor shall use their reasonable efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.
Subject to Section 3(b)(ii), the Company and any Guarantor agree to use their reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the second anniversary of the Issue Date or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and any Guarantor further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company and any Guarantor agree to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
(c) The Company and any Guarantor shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) hereof, does not become effective on or prior to June 4, 2010 (the "Target Registration Date"), the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.25% per annum for the first 90 day period following the Target Registration Date and by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90 day period, up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum, until the earliest of the Exchange Offer being completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becomes effective and November 6, 2010.
 
If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 45 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.25% per annum commencing on the 46th day in such 12-month period for the first 90 day period following such date and by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90 day period, up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum and ending on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.
(e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and any Guarantor acknowledge that any failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's and any Guarantor's obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.
(f) The Company represents, warrants and covenants that it (including its agents and representatives) will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Free Writing Prospectus.

(xvi) so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, cause each Additional Guarantor upon the creation or acquisition by the Company of such Additional Guarantor, to execute a counterpart to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Annex A and to deliver such counterpart, together with an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability thereof against such entity, to the Initial Purchasers no later than five Business Days following the execution thereof.
(b) No Holder of Registrable Securities may include any of its Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing such information as the Company may reasonably request for use in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement (a Holder who provides such information, a "Notice Holder"). In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the intended method of distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and any Guarantor may from time to time reasonably request in writing. Each Notice Holder agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Notice Holder to the Company or of the occurrence of any event in either case as a result of which any Prospectus relating to the Shelf Registration Statement contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Notice Holder or such Notice Holder's intended method of disposition of Registrable Securities or omits to state any material fact regarding such Notice Holder or such Notice Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that such Prospectus shall not contain, with respect to such Notice Holder or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing.
(c) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and any Guarantor of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(v)(2), 3(a)(v)(3), 3(a)(v)(4) or 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(ix) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and any Guarantor, such Holder will deliver to the Company and any Guarantor all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(d) Upon the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development, public filings with the SEC or any other material event that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus, the Company shall give notice (without notice of the nature or details
 
of such events) to the Holders of Registrable Securities that the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement is suspended and, upon actual receipt of any such notice, each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for in Section 3(a)(ix) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. The period during which the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement and any Prospectus is suspended shall not exceed 45 days in any 12 month period. Each Holder shall keep confidential any communications received by it from the Company regarding the suspension of the use of the Prospectus, except as required by applicable law.
(e) The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each an "Underwriter") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.
4. .
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
(a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
The Company and any Guarantor understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and any Guarantor agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and any Guarantor further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
 
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
5. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company and any Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus used in violation of this Agreement or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through JPMorgan or any selling Holder, respectively expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company and any Guarantor, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and any Guarantor, each officer of the Company and any Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Guarantor, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement and any Prospectus.
 
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by JPMorgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
provided
provided
further
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such
 
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and any Guarantor from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and any Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and any Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and any Guarantor or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, any Guarantor and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
pro rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or any Guarantor, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
6. .

Amendments and Waivers.
provided

All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next Business Day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture.
Notices.
(d) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders; that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or obligation to the Company or any Guarantor with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.
Successors and Assigns.
provided
 
(e) Each Holder shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and any Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of other Holders hereunder.
Third Party Beneficiaries.
(f) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Counterparts.

Governing Law.
(j) This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all oral statements and prior writings with respect thereto. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable or against public policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. The Company, any Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which becomes as close as possible to that of the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions.
