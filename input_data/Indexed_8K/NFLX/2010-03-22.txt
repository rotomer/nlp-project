(b) Mr. Greg Stanger, a director of the Company and chair of the Company's audit committee, recently accepted the position of Chief Financial Officer of Chegg, a textbook rental company located in Santa Clara, California. On March 16, 2010, Mr. Stanger indicated he will resign as a director of the Company promptly following the selection of a replacement board member. Until such time as a replacement is appointed, Mr. Stanger intends to continue to serve as a director and as chair of the Company's audit committee.
Mr. Barry McCarthy, the Company's Chief Financial Officer serves on the board of directors of Chegg and as the chair of Chegg's audit committee. The Board has reviewed this relationship and is of the opinion that it will not impact Mr. Stanger's ability to exercise independent judgment and oversight in executing his duties as a director of the Company or as chairman of the Company's audit committee.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
