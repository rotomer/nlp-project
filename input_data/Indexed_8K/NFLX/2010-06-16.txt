(b) On June 10, 2010, Ann Mather was appointed to the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix"). Her appointment is effective July 1, 2010 and she will hold office as a Class II director until the Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2013. In connection with her appointment, Ms. Mather has been appointed to serve as a member of the Company's audit committee.
Ms. Mather will receive an annual retainer of $100,000, payable monthly. In addition, like the Company's other non-employee directors, Ms. Mather will receive stock options pursuant to the Director Equity Compensation Plan. The Director Equity Compensation Plan provides for a monthly grant of stock options to each non-employee director of the Company in consideration for services provided to the Company and subject to the terms and conditions of the Company's 2002 Stock Plan. The actual number of options to be granted to Ms. Mather will be determined by the following formula: $7,000 / ([fair market value on the date of grant] x 0.20). Each monthly grant is made on the first trading day of the month, is fully vested upon grant and is exercisable at a strike price equal to the fair market value as reflected by the closing price on the date of the option grant.
As it does with all directors and executive officers, the Company will enter into an indemnification agreement with Ms. Mather. The indemnification agreement will require the Company to indemnify Ms. Mather, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which she may become subject as a result of her affiliation with the Company. See the Company's Form of Indemnification Agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 20, 2002 as Exhibit 10.1 to the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form S-1/A.
There are no related party transactions between the Company and Ms. Mather that are subject to disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
On June 16, 2010, the Company issued a press release regarding Ms. Mather's election. A copy of the press release is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.
As previously announced, Greg Stanger will step down from the Board. His departure will be effective as of July 1, 2010.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
