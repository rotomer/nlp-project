Explanatory Note
This amendment is being submitted solely to include the date on KPMG's letter attached as Exhibit 16.1 hereto.
 
(a),(b) The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") of Netflix Inc. (the "Company") has completed a competitive process to review the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2012.
As a result of this process on March 21, 2012, the Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, and dismissed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") from that role.
KPMG's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 did not contain any adverse opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the subsequent interim period through March 21, 2012, there were (i) no "disagreements" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, between the Company and KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their reports on the financial statements for such years, and (ii) no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The Company provided KPMG with a copy of the disclosures it is making in this Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Report"). The Company requested that KPMG furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made herein. A copy of KPMG's letter dated March 23, 2012 is attached as Exhibit 16.1 hereto.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the subsequent interim period through March 21, 2012, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has consulted with Ernst & Young with respect to (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Ernst & Young concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" or "reportable event" as those terms are defined in Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-K.
 
(d) Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 16.1
March 23, 2012
Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, D.C. 20549
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We were previously the principal accountants for Netflix, Inc. and, under the date of February 10, 2012, we reported on the consolidated financial statements of Netflix, Inc. as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. On March 21, 2012, we were dismissed. We have read Netflix, Inc.'s statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-k dated March 23, 2012, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with Netflix , Inc.'s statement that Ernst & Young LLP was not engaged regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Netflix, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Very truly yours,
/s/ KPMG LLP
