AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of May 29, 2002, is by and among Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Newfield Operating Company, a Texas corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and EEX Corporation, a Texas corporation ("COMPANY"). WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders that Parent acquire Company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "MERGER") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and such Boards of Directors have approved the Merger; WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the approval of Company's Board of Directors, Parent, David A. Trice and Terry W. Rathert have entered into a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy with Warburg, Pincus Equity Partners, L.P., Warburg, Pincus Netherlands Equity Partners I, C.V., Warburg, Pincus Netherlands Equity Partners II, C.V., Warburg, Pincus Netherlands Equity Partners III, C.V. (collectively, the "WARBURG ENTITIES"), Thomas M. Hamilton, David R. Henderson and Richard S. Langdon under which such parties have, among other things, agreed to support the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"); WHEREAS, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the Warburg Entities have agreed to sell all of the warrants outstanding under each of the Company's Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants issued to certain of the Warburg Entities on January 7, 1999 (collectively, the "WARRANT AGREEMENTS") to Parent at the Effective Time; WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT") with the Warburg Entities, to be effective as of the Effective Time, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Warburg Entities in the Merger; and WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"); NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I THE MERGER 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall be the surviving 1
corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Article 5.06 of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA"), including the Surviving Corporation's succession to and assumption of all rights and obligations of Merger Sub. 1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall become effective (the "EFFECTIVE TIME") upon the later of (i) the filing of the properly executed Articles of Merger relating to the Merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of Texas in accordance with the TBCA, and the issuance by the Secretary of State of Texas of a certificate of merger with respect thereto, and (ii) at such later time as the parties shall agree and set forth in the Articles of Merger. The filing of the Articles of Merger shall be made as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII. 1.3 TAX TREATMENT. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. ARTICLE II THE SURVIVING CORPORATION 2.1 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that they are identical to the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the TBCA. 2.2 BYLAWS. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and as provided by the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the TBCA. 2.3 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. ARTICLE III CONVERSION OF SHARES 3.1 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital stock described below: 2
(a) TREASURY STOCK. All shares of common stock of Company, par value $.01 per share (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights set forth in the Company Rights Plan (as defined in Section 4.2)), "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), that are held in Company's treasury shall be canceled and retired and no cash, capital stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. (b) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to Section 3.4, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(a)) shall be converted into (i) .05703 of one share (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") of Parent's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights set forth in the Parent Rights Plan (as defined in Section 5.2), "PARENT COMMON STOCK") or (ii) if the holder of such share has made a Unit Election (as defined in Section 3.2(b)), (A) the quotient of (x) the number of whole Trust Units (as defined in Section 7.13) elected to be received by, and that are allocated to, such holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 (the "ALLOCATED TRUST UNITS" ) divided by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by the Election Form (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for such holder and (B) the fraction of one share of Parent Common Stock, if any, remaining after reducing the Exchange Ratio by the quotient of (x) .00054 multiplied by the Allocated Trust Units for such holder and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by the Election Form for such holder. Such consideration, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 3.4, without interest, is referred to herein as the "COMMON STOCK MERGER CONSIDERATION." All shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and the holder of a certificate ("COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATE") that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3. (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK. Subject to Section 3.4, the shares of Series B 8% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, no par value, of Company ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus all accrued and unpaid dividends shall be converted into an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, with each holder of Company Preferred Stock to receive a pro rata portion of such shares of Parent Common Stock based on such holder's ownership of Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such consideration, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof, as contemplated by Section 3.4, without interest, is referred to herein as (the "PREFERRED STOCK MERGER CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). All shares of Company Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and the holder of a certificate ("PREFERRED STOCK CERTIFICATE" and, together with Common Stock Certificates, "STOCK CERTIFICATES") that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3. 3
(d) CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share ("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall from and after the Effective Time evidence ownership of the same number of shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. (e) PARENT COMMON STOCK. Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger. (f) DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock Certificate with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration represented thereby until the holder of record of such Stock Certificate shall surrender such Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.3. Subject to the effect of applicable laws (including escheat and abandoned property laws), following surrender of any such Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate or certificates representing the Merger Consideration issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Merger Consideration, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend or distribution payable with respect to Merger Consideration has not occurred prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate, at the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate and a payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Stock Certificate. (g) FULL SATISFACTION; NO REGISTRATION AT TRANSFER. All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Stock Certificates and Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock formerly represented thereby, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 3.2 ELECTION AND ALLOCATION PROCEDURES. (a) An election form (an "ELECTION FORM") and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Common Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 3.3), in such form as Parent and Company shall mutually agree shall be mailed contemporaneously with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 4.4(b)) to shareholders of record of the Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting (as defined in Section 7.9). Company shall use all reasonable efforts to make an Election Form available to all 4
Persons who become holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock between the date of mailing described in the immediately preceding sentence and the Election Deadline. (b) An Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect to receive whole Trust Units in lieu of all or any portion of the Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise receive in the Merger (a "UNIT ELECTION"). No holder of Company Common Stock may elect to receive more Trust Units than the product of (i) 105.611 and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder, rounded down to the nearest whole Trust Unit. Unit Elections may be made only for whole Trust Units. No fractional interests in Trust Units will be issued. Shareholders of record of Company Common Stock who hold shares of Company Common Stock as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit multiple Election Forms provided that such representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held by that representative for a particular beneficial owner. (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form must be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m. Houston, Texas time on the second business day prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting (as defined in Section 7.9) (or such other time and date as Parent and Company may mutually agree) (the "ELECTION DEADLINE" ). An election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Common Stock Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Parent pursuant to Section 3.3, indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. A holder of Company Common Stock may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change such holder's election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Election Form. The obligation to deliver Common Stock Certificates may be satisfied by delivering a guarantee of delivery of such Common Stock Certificates, as set forth in the Election Form, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, provided such Common Stock Certificates are in fact delivered by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery. A holder of Company Common Stock may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke such holder's election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of such shareholder's Common Stock Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and Company that this Agreement has been terminated. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and the decision of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall have any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent. 5
(d) Within ten business days after the later to occur of the Election Deadline or the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive Trust Units as follows: (i) If, in the aggregate, the holders of Company Common Stock elect to receive no more than 42,487,395 Trust Units, then the full number of Trust Units elected to be received by each electing shareholder shall be allocated to such shareholder; and (ii) If, in the aggregate, the holders of Company of Common Stock elect to receive more than 42,487,395 Trust Units, then each electing holder shall be allocated a number of whole Trust Units equal to the sum of (A) the lesser of (1) the number of Trust Units such electing holder elected to receive and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by the Election Form for such holder plus (B) the product of (1) the result of 42,875,395 less the aggregate number of Trust Units allocated to all electing holders pursuant to clause (A) above multiplied by (2) a fraction the numerator of which is the amount, if any, by which the number of Trust Units such electing holder elected to receive exceeds the number of Trust Units allocated to such holder pursuant to clause (A) above and the denominator of which is the amount by which the aggregate number of Trust Units elected to be received by all electing holders exceeds the aggregate number of Trust Units allocated to all electing holders pursuant to clause (A) above, rounded down to the nearest whole Trust Unit. 3.3 SURRENDER AND EXCHANGE. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize one or more transfer agent(s) reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") with respect to the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3 through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and Trust Units issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends with respect thereto (such shares of Parent Common Stock and Trust Units, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for surrendered Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund. If an allocation is necessary pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(ii), upon completion of such allocation, the Exchange Agent shall return any excess shares of Parent Common Stock and Trust Units to Parent. Except as contemplated by Section 3.3(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. (b) LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than five Business Days (as defined below) thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each shareholder of record of Company at the Effective Time who did not submit a properly completed and executed Election Form accompanied by an appropriately endorsed Stock Certificate or Certificates representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder (or, alternatively, by an appropriate guarantee of delivery) a letter of 6
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the exchange of such Stock Certificates for the Common Stock Merger Consideration (with respect to the Company Common Stock) or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (with respect to the Company Preferred Stock). Provision also shall be made for holders of Company Preferred Stock to procure in person immediately after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of transmittal and Preferred Stock Certificates representing the Company Preferred Stock in exchange for the applicable Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "BUSINESS DAY" means any date that is not a Saturday or Sunday or other day on which banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in New York, New York. (c) RIGHT TO RECEIVE MERGER CONSIDERATION. After the Effective Time, Stock Certificates shall represent the right, upon surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed and properly completed letter of transmittal relating thereto, to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration subject to any required tax withholding, and the Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash amount payable upon the surrender of any such Stock Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Stock Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. (d) TRANSFER. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person (as defined below) other than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Stock Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, "PERSON" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 4.4(b)). (e) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any Merger Consideration in the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holder's Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 3.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, to exchange such Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1. If outstanding Stock Certificates are not surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or, in any particular case, prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of such Stock Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency), the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of such Stock Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the Surviving 7
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration delivered, to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (f) LOST STOCK CERTIFICATES. If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. (g) WITHHOLDING OF TAX. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such amounts as Parent (or any affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are properly withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent. (h) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent may invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund in deposit accounts (of commercial banks having capital and surplus in excess of $100 million) or short-term money market funds (having assets in excess of $1 billion), as directed by Parent, on a daily basis.

(ii) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide written proposal by a third Person directly or indirectly, to acquire businesses representing more than 50% of Company's consolidated net revenues, (based on the most recent income statement filed with the SEC), or assets representing more than 50% of Company's total assets on a consolidated basis (based on fair market value), or more than 50% of Company's voting capital stock, whether by way of merger, amalgamation, arrangement, tender offer, share exchange, take-over bid, recapitalization, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise, that in the good faith determination by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Company, after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and the Person making such proposal, (a) is reasonably capable of being completed without undue delay and (b) is more favorable to Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger. 7.3 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a) Parent shall, to the extent that Company would be permitted by applicable law or its bylaws, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and 34
expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the next succeeding sentence, settlements arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time based on or arising out of the fact, in whole or in part, that such person is or was a director or officer of such party. Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Parent shall, to the fullest extent that Company would be permitted under applicable law, advance expenses to the Indemnified Parties. Parent and Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matters contemplated by this Section 7.3. (b) Parent shall maintain Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy ("D&O INSURANCE") for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers if (i) the carrier of such substitute policies maintains a Best rating equal to or greater than the Company's existing carrier and (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, further, that in no event will Parent be required to expend annually more than 200% of the last annual premium paid by Company prior to the date hereof for such insurance (the amount of which is set forth in Section 7.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), but in such event shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent contained in this Section 7.3 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Parent. In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that successors and assigns of Parent honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 7.3. (d) The obligations of Parent under this Section 7.3 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 7.3 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 7.3 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.3, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.3). 7.4 APPROPRIATE ACTIONS; CONSENTS; FILINGS.

Company and Parent acknowledge that the Warburg Entities and certain of their affiliates may be required to make a filing under the HSR Act and shall provide such assistance to the Warburg Entities and their affiliates as is reasonably required for the Warburg Entities and their affiliates to obtain approval from the Federal Trade Commission in connection therewith.

(b) Parent and Company agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use all of their respective reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances required for Closing (including through compliance with the HSR Act and any applicable foreign government reporting requirements), to respond to any government requests for information, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (each, an "ORDER") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action. Parent and Company also agree to take any and all of the following actions to the extent necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable laws regarding the Merger: entering into negotiations; providing information; substantially complying with any second request for information pursuant to the HSR Act; making proposals; and entering into and performing agreements or submitting to judicial or administrative orders; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or Company take, or be required to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law.

(b) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, to participate or vesting (but not the accrual of benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent or Company for the benefit of employees of Company and its Subsidiaries, employees of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be credited for service accrued as of the Effective Time with Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent such service was credited under a similar plan, program or arrangement of Company.

(i) If the Company at any time proposes to file a registration statement or prospectus supplement to an already effective shelf registration statement with respect to an Underwritten Offering of Common Stock for its own account or for the account of any holders of Common Stock (other than (x) a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, (y) a registration relating solely to a Rule 145 transaction, or (z) a registration on any registration form which does not permit secondary sales or does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities), then, as soon as practicable following (A) the meeting of the Company's board of directors at which such Underwritten Offering is approved (the "Board Meeting") or (B) the execution by the directors of the Company of a unanimous written consent in lieu of such meeting approving such Underwritten Offering (the "Written Consent"), but in no event less than three Business Days prior to the proposed date of filing such registration statement or prospectus supplement, the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the Holder Representative (provided that, in the case of an Underwritten Offering pursuant to clause (c) of the definition thereof, such notice shall be given concurrently with the approval of such Underwritten Offering by the Company's board of directors at the Board Meeting or concurrently with the circulation of the Written Consent to the Company's directors) and such notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request in writing (a "Piggyback Registration"). Subject to Section 3(b), the Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering all such Registrable Securities ("Included Registrable Securities") with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within one Business Day after the Company's notice has been given in accordance with Section 16 (provided that, in the case of an Underwritten Offering pursuant to clause (c) of the definition thereof, such written requests for inclusion must be received by the Company no later than (x) if such Underwritten Offering is approved at a Board Meeting, the later of (A) 6:00 p.m. New York City time on the day of the Board Meeting and (B) three hours following the adjournment of the Board Meeting or (y) if such Underwritten Offering is approved by a Written Consent, three hours following the circulation of such Written Consent to the Company's directors). If at any time after giving written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten Offering and prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the Company shall determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay such 5
Underwritten Offering, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the Holder Representative and, (x) in the case of a determination not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Included Registrable Securities in connection with such Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of a determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in the Underwritten Offering. (ii) Each Holder making a request for its Registrable Securities to be included therein must, and the Company shall make such arrangements with the underwriters so that each such Holder may, participate in such Underwritten Offering on the same terms as other Persons selling Common Stock in such Underwritten Offering. If the offering pursuant to such registration is to be on any other basis, then each Holder making a request for a Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 3(a) must participate in such offering on such basis. (b) Priority of Piggyback Registration. If the managing underwriter or underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of Common Stock included in a Piggyback Registration informs the Holders in writing that, in its or their opinion, the total amount of Common Stock which such Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Stock offered or the market for the Common Stock, then the Common Stock to be included in such registration shall be allocated as follows: (i) first, 100% of the Common Stock that the Company or any Person (other than a Holder) exercising a contractual right to registration has proposed to sell shall be included therein; (ii) second, and only if all the Common Stock referenced in clause (i) have been included, the number of Registrable Securities that, in the opinion of such underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect shall be included therein, with such number to be allocated pro rata among the Holders which have requested participation in the Piggyback Registration (based, for each such Holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (A) the number of Registrable Securities beneficially owned by such Holder on a fully diluted basis; by (B) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities beneficially owned by all such Holders on a fully diluted basis); and (iii) third, and only if all of the Common Stock referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) have been included, any other Common Stock eligible for inclusion in such registration which, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect shall be included therein. 6
4. Blackout Periods. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may, upon written notice to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in a Shelf Registration Statement, suspend such Holders' use of any prospectus which is a part of the Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Holders shall discontinue sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement) if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Company, the Company possesses material nonpublic information; provided that the Company may not suspend any such sales for more than an aggregate of 45 consecutive days or for an aggregate of 90 days in any period of 12 consecutive months. Upon the termination of the condition described above, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated by this Agreement. 5. Registration Procedures. (a) In connection with the Company's registration obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall, subject to the limitations set forth herein, effect such registration so as to permit the sale of the applicable Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof (which in the case of Warburg shall include a Warburg Partner Distribution, the listing (to the extent required by the Securities Act) of the partners of Warburg in the registration statement and the subsequent sale by the partners in Warburg of such Registrable Securities) and in conformity with any required time periods set forth herein, and in connection therewith the Company shall: (i) before filing a registration statement or prospectus with the Commission, or any amendments or supplements thereto and in connection therewith, furnish to the Holders holding the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, copies of all documents prepared to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review and comment of such Holders and their respective counsel, and the Company shall make such changes as are reasonably requested by such Holders or counsel; (ii) prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Securities Act, which form shall be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities; provided, however, the Company shall not file any registration statement or amendment thereto or any prospectus or any supplement thereto (it being understood that filings pursuant to the Exchange Act by the Company that are incorporated by reference are not amendments or supplements to such registration statement for purposes of this Section 5(a)(ii)) to which the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement shall, in a timely manner, reasonably object; (iii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments or supplements to the applicable registration statement or prospectus used in connection therewith as may be (A) reasonably requested by any participating Holder (to the extent 7

(xv) use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and make generally available to its securityholders consolidated earnings statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year), commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Company after the effective date of a registration statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods; (xvi) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by the applicable registration statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such registration statement; (xvii) cause all Registrable Securities of a class covered by the applicable registration statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which any of the Company's securities of such class are then listed or quoted and on each inter-dealer quotation system on which any of the Company's securities of such class are then quoted; (xviii) make available upon reasonable notice at reasonable times and for reasonable periods for inspection by the Holder Representative, by any managing underwriter or underwriters participating in any disposition of such Registrable Securities and by any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by such sellers or any such managing underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause all of the Company's officers and directors and the independent public accountants who have audited its financial statements to make themselves available, upon reasonable notice and for reasonable periods during normal business hours, to discuss the business of the Company and to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Holder, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such registration statement as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility (subject to the entry by each party referred to in this Section 5(a)(xviii) into customary confidentiality agreements in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company); and (xix) if any fact or event contemplated by clause (a)(v) above shall exist or have occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Registrable Securities, the prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. (b) The Company may require each selling Holder as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company such information regarding the distribution of such Holders' Registrable Securities and such other information relating to such Holder and its ownership of the applicable Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request; provided that (i) Warburg and the partners in Warburg shall not be 10
obligated to furnish any information as to the beneficial owners of the partners in Warburg (except to the extent the Company is required by the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act to disclose such information in connection with this Agreement), and (ii) with respect to recipients of a Warburg Partner Distribution, information provided by Warburg shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this sentence (except to the extent the Company is required by the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act to disclose additional information with respect to such recipients in connection with this Agreement). Each Holder agrees to furnish such information to the Company and to cooperate with the Company as necessary to enable the Company to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to exclude any Holder that does not comply with the preceding sentence from the applicable registration. (c) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of its Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(a)(v), such Holder will discontinue disposition of its Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 5(a)(xix) and of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the prospectus, or until such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities which are current at the time of the receipt of such notice. 6. Registration Expenses. The Company shall pay all of the following expenses in connection with a registration under this Agreement of Registrable Securities: (i) all registration and filing fees, and any other fees and expenses associated with filings required to be made with the Commission or the NASD, (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities or state securities or "Blue Sky" laws, (iii) all of its printing, duplicating, word processing, messenger, telephone, facsimile and delivery expenses (including expenses of printing certificates for the Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company and of printing prospectuses), (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and of all independent certified public accountants of the Company, (v) Securities Act liability insurance or similar insurance if the Company so desires or the underwriter or underwriters, if any, so require in accordance with then-customary underwriting practice, (vi) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities on any securities exchange or the quotation of the Registrable Securities on any inter-dealer quotation system, and (vii) the fees and expenses of one counsel to the Holders (selected by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement) in an amount not to exceed $10,000. In addition, the Company shall pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company. The Company shall not be required to pay any other costs or expenses in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (x) all expenses incurred by the Holders (except as provided in clauses (i), (ii) and (vii) of the 11
preceding sentence), (y) underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities and (z) the fees and expenses of counsel to the underwriters. 7. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each Holder selling Registrable Securities and its respective officers, directors, employees, partners, attorneys and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act) such selling Holder ("Participant") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal expenses) caused by, arising out of, or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary, or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein) or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (each, a "Loss" and collectively "Losses"); provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Participant in any such case to the extent that any such Loss is caused by written information furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in the preparation thereof, or if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to such prospectus which has been made available to the Holders and the relevant Holder fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sales of the Registrable Securities to the Person asserting such Loss. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. (b) Indemnification by the Holders. Each selling Holder agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act) from and against any Loss to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Loss is caused by any information furnished in writing by such selling Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such registration statement and was not corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities to the Person asserting such Loss. The liability of any Holder under this paragraph shall in no event exceed the amount by which the proceeds received by such Holder from sales of Registrable Securities giving rise to such obligations exceed the amount of any Loss that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability such Holder may otherwise have. (c) Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party") shall (i) give prompt written notice to the Person from whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it of any obligation or liability which it may have hereunder or otherwise 12
except to the extent it is materially prejudiced by such failure, and (ii) permit such Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (A) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after having received notice of such claim from the Indemnified Party and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, or (C) in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, based upon advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claims or the Indemnified Party has defenses separate and apart from the defenses of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that the Indemnified Party intends to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such defense is assumed by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that an Indemnifying Party shall not be required to consent to any settlement involving the imposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such Indemnifying Party other than financial obligations for which such Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such action without the consent of the Indemnified Party; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall be required to obtain such consent (which consent may be withheld in the Indemnified Party's sole discretion) if the settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party or any equitable remedies or restriction on the Indemnified Party or its officers, directors or employees or if the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Indemnifying Party may not be able to satisfy its obligations thereunder. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. The Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time from all Indemnified Parties unless (x) the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (y) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based on advice of counsel to an Indemnified Party) between such Indemnified Parties, in each of which cases the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or an behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of securities. (d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in the paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 7, then the Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a 13
result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7(d) to the contrary, no Indemnifying Party (other than the Company) shall be required pursuant to this Section 7(d) to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Indemnifying Party from the sale of Registrable Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the Indemnified Parties relate exceed the amount of any damages that such Indemnifying Party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the second preceding sentence. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. If indemnification is available under this Section 7, the Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify each Indemnified Party to the full extent provided in Sections 7(a) and 7(b) hereof without regard to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Parties or Indemnified Party. 8. Compliance with Rule 144. The Company shall file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, so long as the Company is obligated to file such reports, and it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time or (b) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 9. Underwriting Agreements. The Holders holding any Registrable Securities to be included in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 3 shall enter into an underwriting agreement reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to the Company and the underwriters. No Holder shall be required in any such underwriting agreement to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than customary representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Holder, such Holder's Registrable Securities, such Holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations required by law. 14
10. Effectiveness; Termination. (a) This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall become effective only upon the closing of the Merger at the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement shall be of no force and effect. (b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective Date and (ii) the end of the Effectiveness Period. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with clause (ii) above, the provisions of Sections 7, 10-16 and 20 shall survive any such termination. 11. Amendments and Waivers. The Provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived at any time only by the written agreement of the Company and the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities; provided, however, (i) any amendment or waiver of Section 7, 11 or 20 shall only be binding on those Holders that have expressly agreed to such amendment or waiver and (ii) for a period of two years after the Effective Time, any amendment or waiver of Section 10 shall only be binding on those Holders that have expressly agreed to such amendment or waiver. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any such Holders of any provision or condition of this Agreement must be made in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in writing. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 11 shall be binding upon each Holder and the Company, except as provided in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 11. Each Holder acknowledges that by operation of this Section 11 the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities, acting in conjunction with the Company, will have the right and power to diminish or eliminate all rights pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 11. 12. Successors, Assigns and Transferees. (a) The registration rights of any Holder under this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities may be transferred and assigned, provided that no such transfer or assignment shall be binding upon or obligate the Company to any such transferee or assignee unless and until the Company shall have received notice of such transfer or assignment and a written agreement of the transferee or assignee to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. (b) In the event that, either immediately prior to or subsequent to the effectiveness of any registration statement, any Holder shall distribute Registrable Securities to its partners, such Holder shall so advise the Company and provide such information as shall be necessary to permit an amendment to such registration statement to provide information with respect to such partners, as selling stockholders. Promptly following receipt of such information, the Company shall file an appropriate amendment to such registration statement reflecting the information so provided. (c) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns as well as the parties referenced in Section 20. 15
13. Final Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the final agreement of the parties concerning the matters referred to herein, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings. 14. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be valid and enforceable. 15.

EXHIBIT 10.4 UBS AG UBS WARBURG LLC Stamford Branch 299 Park Avenue 677 Washington Boulevard New York, New York 10171 Stamford, Connecticut 06901 May 29, 2002 Newfield Exploration Company 363 North Sam Houston Parkway Suite 2020 Houston, TX 77060 Attention: Mr. Terry Rathert Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary Bridge Loan Facility Commitment Letter Ladies and Gentlemen: Newfield Exploration Company ("you" or "Company" or "Newfield") has advised UBS AG, Stamford Branch ("UBS") and UBS Warburg LLC ("UBSW" and together with UBS, "we" or "us") that you desire to raise up to $325,000,000 of debt financing from a group of lenders to be arranged by UBSW to provide funds for the refinancing (the "Refinancing") of certain indebtedness of EEX Corporation identified on Exhibit A to this Commitment Letter ("Target" or the "Acquired Business") to be effected in connection with the merger (the "Acquisition") of Target with a wholly owned subsidiary of Company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 29, 2002 (the "Acquisition Agreement") among Target, Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Company (collectively, the "Transactions"). All references to "dollars" or "$" in this agreement and the attachments hereto are references to United States dollars. You have advised us that the sources and uses of funds for the Transaction are as set forth in Exhibit A to this Commitment Letter. We understand that the sources of the debt financing will be a senior secured bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") of up to $325,000,000 as described in the Summary of Principal Terms and Conditions attached hereto as Annex I (the "Term Sheet") borrowed jointly and severally by Target, EEX Capital, Inc. and EEX Operating LLC (each wholly-owned subsidiaries of Target) (collectively, "Borrower"). You have advised us that Company will use its reasonable best efforts to refinance the loans and/or commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility as soon as practicable with the proceeds of debt and/or equity or equity-linked securities issued by Company and/or proceeds from the existing credit agreement dated January 23, 2001 of Company agented by JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Newfield Senior Facility").
-2- Commitments. You have requested that UBS commit to provide the Bridge Facility and that UBSW agree to structure, arrange and syndicate the Bridge Facility. UBS is pleased to advise you of its commitment to provide the entire amount of the Bridge Facility to Borrower upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth or referred to in this Commitment Letter. The commitment of UBS and each other Lender (as defined below) hereunder is subject to the negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive documentation (the "Bridge Documentation") with respect to the Bridge Facility satisfactory to UBS and the other Lenders reflecting, among other things, the terms and conditions set forth in the Term Sheet and in the letter of even date herewith addressed to you providing, among other things, for certain fees relating to the Bridge Facility (the "Fee Letter"). You agree that the closing date of the Acquisition and the concurrent closing of the Bridge Facility (the "Closing Date") shall be a date mutually agreed upon between you and us, but in any event shall not occur until the terms and conditions hereof and in the Term Sheet (including the conditions to initial funding) have been satisfied. The commitment hereunder shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the net proceeds of any debt, equity or equity-linked securities issued by Company, Target or any of their subsidiaries and by the proceeds of any senior bank financing by Company, Target or any of their respective subsidiaries, other than drawings under the Newfield Senior Facility to the extent not in excess of $200,000,000. Syndication. It is agreed that UBSW will act as the sole and exclusive advisor, lead arranger and book-runner for the Bridge Facility, and will exclusively manage the syndication of the Bridge Facility, and will, in such capacities, exclusively perform the duties and exercise the authority customarily associated with such roles. It is further agreed that no additional advisors, agents, co-agents, arrangers or book-runner will be appointed and no Lender will receive compensation with respect to the Bridge Facility outside the terms contained herein and in the Fee Letter in order to obtain its commitment to participate in the Bridge Facility, in each case unless you and we so agree. UBS reserves the right, prior to or after execution of the Bridge Documentation, to syndicate all or a portion of its commitment to one or more institutions in consultation with Company that will become parties to the Bridge Documentation (UBS and the institutions becoming parties to the Bridge Documentation, the "Lenders"). Upon any such additional Lender issuing its commitment to provide a portion of any of the Bridge Facility, UBS shall be released from a portion of its commitment in respect of the Bridge Facility in an aggregate amount equal to the commitment of such Lender. You agree actively to, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Borrower to, assist UBSW in achieving a timely syndication of the Bridge Facility that is satisfactory to UBSW. UBSW will exclusively manage all aspects of the syndication of the Bridge Facility in consultation with you, including selection of additional Lenders, determination of when UBSW will approach potential additional Lenders, any naming rights and the final allocations of the commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility among the additional Lenders. To assist UBSW in its syndication efforts, you agree (a) promptly to prepare and provide (and to use your reasonable best efforts to
-3- cause Target and your and their representatives to prepare and provide) all financial and other information as we may reasonably request with respect to Company, Target, their respective subsidiaries, the Transactions and any other transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to financial projections (the "Projections") relating to the foregoing, (b) to use your reasonable best efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts benefit materially from existing lending relationships of Company and its subsidiaries, (c) to use your reasonable best efforts to make available to prospective Lenders, senior management and advisors of Company, Target and their respective subsidiaries, (d) to host, with UBSW, one or more meetings with prospective Lenders, (e) to assist, and to use your reasonable best efforts to cause Target and your and its advisors to assist, UBSW in the preparation of one or more confidential information memoranda and other marketing materials satisfactory to UBSW to be used in connection with the syndication of the Bridge Facility and (f) to obtain, at your expense, ratings of the Bridge Facility from rating agencies selected by UBSW and to participate actively in the process of securing such ratings, including having your senior management meet with such rating agencies. Information. You hereby represent and covenant that (a) all information (other than the Projections) concerning Company, Target, their respective subsidiaries, the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Information") that has been or will be made available to any of the Lenders or UBSW by you or any of your representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, when taken as a whole, is or will be complete and correct in all material respects and does not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements are made and (b) the Projections that have been or will be made available to any of the Lenders or UBSW by you or any of your representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby have been and will be prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by you to be reasonable. You agree to supplement the Information and the Projections from time to time and agree to advise UBSW of all developments materially affecting Company, Target or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or the transactions contemplated hereby or the accuracy of Information and Projections previously furnished to UBSW or any of the Lenders. You acknowledge that UBS and UBSW may in connection with providing the financing under the Bridge Facility and the syndication thereof share with any of their affiliates, and such affiliates may share with UBS and UBSW, any information related to Company, Borrower, Target or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates (including in each case information relating to creditworthiness) and the transactions contemplated hereby. Compensation. As consideration for the commitments of the Lenders hereunder with respect to the Bridge Facility and the agreement of UBSW to structure, arrange and syndicate the Bridge Facility and to provide advisory services in connection therewith, you agree to pay, or cause to be paid, to UBS and UBSW the fees set forth in the Term Sheet and Fee Letter. Once paid, such fees shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
-4- Conditions. The commitment of the Lenders hereunder with respect to the Bridge Facility and UBSW's agreement to perform the services described herein may be terminated by UBS or UBSW if (i) the terms of the Transactions are changed from those described herein and in the Term Sheet in any respect reasonably determined by UBS or UBSW to be material; (ii) any information submitted to UBS or UBSW by or on behalf of Company, Target or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading in any respect reasonably determined by UBS or UBSW to be material; (iii) the structure, terms and conditions of the Acquisition differ in any material respect from those set forth in the draft of the Acquisition Agreement delivered to UBS and its counsel on May 28, 2002; (iv) the transactions contemplated hereby and the financing therefor (including borrowings under the Bridge Facility) are not in full compliance with all applicable legal requirements, including without limitation, Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; (v) there shall be any pending or threatened litigation or other proceedings (private or governmental) which UBS or UBSW reasonably determines could be materially adverse to Company, Target, any of their respective subsidiaries and/or the transactions contemplated hereby taken as a whole, including the financing therefor; (vi) any change occurs, or any additional information is disclosed to or discovered by UBS or UBSW (including, without limitation, information contained in any review or report required to be provided to it in connection herewith), which UBS or UBSW deems to be materially adverse in respect of the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), properties or prospects of Company, Target or any of their respective subsidiaries taken as a whole; (vii) any of the fees provided for by the Fee Letter are not paid when due; (viii) in the sole reasonable judgment of UBS or UBSW, a material adverse change or material disruption has occurred in the financial, banking or capital markets generally after the date of this Commitment Letter (including, without limitation, the markets for loans to or debt, equity or equity-linked securities issued by companies similar to Company), which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the syndication of the Bridge Facility or the refinancing of the Bridge Facility; or (ix) any condition set forth in the Term Sheet is not satisfied or any covenant or agreement in this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter is not complied with.

EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY TO ACQUIRE EEX CORPORATION* Newfield will hold a conference call for investors at 8:30 a.m. CDT/9:30 a.m. EDT, on Thursday, May 30, 2002. The call can be heard on the Newfield web site at www.newfld.com or you can participate by following the instructions listed at the end of this release. There is a presentation available on Newfield's web site regarding this transaction that will also be referenced in the above conference call. Houston - May 29, 2002 -- Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE:NFX) today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire EEX Corporation (NYSE: EEX) in a transaction valued at $640 million, including the assumption of debt, net of cash, and other existing obligations. The boards of both Newfield and EEX have approved the merger agreement and the board of EEX has recommended that their shareholders approve the transaction. Newfield plans to issue approximately 7.1 million shares in the transaction, or approximately 12.4% of Newfield's outstanding common stock (on a fully diluted basis) following the close of the transaction. Newfield also will assume about $360 million in EEX debt and existing obligations. Post-closing, Newfield will have approximately 56 million shares outstanding and a total enterprise value of approximately $2.8 billion (based on Newfield's May 29 closing price). Newfield expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to cash flow and earnings. Under the merger agreement, EEX's common shareholders will receive ...05703 of one share of Newfield common stock for each share of EEX common stock, or an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million shares of Newfield common stock. The holders of EEX's preferred stock will receive a total of 4.7 million shares of Newfield common stock in the merger. EEX's common shareholders will have the option to elect to receive units in a new trust in lieu of Newfield stock. Approximately 42.5 million trust units will be available. For each unit that an EEX shareholder elects to receive, the number of shares of Newfield common stock that the shareholder would otherwise receive will be reduced by .00054 of one Newfield share. The trust will own overriding royalty interests in future production from intervals generally below 20,000' from certain Gulf of Mexico lease blocks in which EEX owns or may acquire an interest. There is no production currently associated with the royalty interests. The merger is subject to the approval of EEX's common shareholders, certain regulatory approvals and other conditions. All of EEX's preferred shareholders have signed an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares for the merger. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002. Newfield President and CEO, David A. Trice, said, "The assets and operations of Newfield and EEX are very complementary. EEX's onshore properties are located primarily in
our core South Texas focus area. Our combined operations will make us one of the largest independent producers in this prolific natural gas basin. EEX's reserves have been added almost exclusively through the drill bit by a group of talented employees in EEX's San Antonio office. We will be extremely pleased to have them join Newfield. "EEX's offshore oil and gas properties will establish Newfield in the deepwater. Over the past year, we have recruited and developed a deepwater team at Newfield and this acquisition now provides a significant property base. A majority of the deepwater blocks are in partnership with Shell, a leader in deepwater development and technology. EEX also has developed an intriguing deep play on the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and has recently entered into a joint venture with BP Exploration, which will lead the effort to develop this concept. Strategically and economically this is a great acquisition for Newfield." Newfield's executive staff will continue in their current roles following the close of this transaction. Newfield expects to decrease EEX's current G&A expense by about 50%. The following table details the complementary nature of the assets and the significance of this acquisition to Newfield. ** EEX's booked U.S. proved reserves at year-end 2001 were 417 Bcfe. Newfield's estimate of these reserves at year-end 2001 is about 20% less.
Newfield is also acquiring a substantial exploration acreage and prospect portfolio in deepwater and working and royalty interests in undeveloped discoveries in the Llano Basin, which is located in the Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico. Other material assets include the Enserch Garden Banks Cooper Production facility and its related equipment, fee minerals and corporate tax attributes. Newfield has obtained a commitment to provide it with a secured bridge facility to pay maturing EEX debt and other obligations at closing. On a March 31, 2002 pro forma basis, Newfield would, under current financing plans, have approximately 56 million common shares outstanding (on a fully diluted basis), approximately $335 million of net bank debt, $300 million of Senior Notes, $144 million in convertible trust preferred securities, and the EEX senior secured bridge facility. Debt as a percentage of book capitalization would be about 41%, excluding the trust preferred securities. UBS Warburg LLC acted as a financial advisor for Newfield Exploration. Newfield Exploration is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. The Company has a solid asset base of producing properties and exploration and development drilling opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, along the U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, in the Anadarko and Permian Basins, offshore Australia and in China's Bohai Bay. Newfield balances its drilling program with acquisitions in select areas in the U.S. and overseas. EEX Corporation is an oil and gas exploration and production company with activities currently focused in Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico.
