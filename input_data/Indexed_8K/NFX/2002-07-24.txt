ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On July 22, 2002, Newfield issued a press release that contained the following estimates of certain significant operating and financial data for the third quarter of 2002. THIRD QUARTER 2002 ESTIMATES - ---------------------------- Below are estimates of certain significant operating and financial data for the third quarter of 2002. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information set forth below. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING Newfield's natural gas production in the third quarter of 2002 is expected to be 34 - 37 Bcf (370 - 410 MMcf/d). The price received by the Company for its natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from the Company's Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Consolidated oil production in the third quarter of 2002 is expected to be 1.4 - 1.6 million barrels (16,000 - 18,000 BOPD). Australian oil production during the third quarter is expected to be 260 - 285 thousand barrels (2,800 - 3,100 BOPD). The oil volume estimates for the Company's Australian production in the third quarter reflect production downtime associated with annual maintenance on the production facilities. The timing of liftings in Australia will impact reported production and revenues. The price the Company receives from its Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX WTI price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold for a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Australian crude oil sales are based on the Tapis Benchmark, which has historically been comparable to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. For the full-year 2002, the Company expects to produce 180-185 Bcfe, an increase of 3-6% over 2001 production volumes. This production estimate excludes the impact of the previously announced agreement to acquire EEX Corporation, which is expected to close in late September 2002. The Company may, however, elect to voluntarily curtail production in response to low oil and gas prices. Any curtailments could adversely impact the Company's growth projections. LEASE OPERATING EXPENSE Newfield's LOE, including domestic production and severance taxes and resource rent tax in Australia, is expected to be $31 - $35 million in the third quarter of 2002 ($0.70 - $0.78 per Mcfe). The Company's domestic LOE, including taxes, is expected to be $0.60 - $0.66 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2002. This estimate includes severance taxes of $0.08 - $0.10 per Mcfe. LOE varies and is subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE Newfield's G&A expense for the third quarter of 2002 is expected to be $12 - $13 million ($0.26 - $0.29 per Mcfe). This estimate includes accrual of performance-based pay. INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the third quarter of 2002 is expected to be $6 - $7 million ($0.14 - $0.16 per Mcfe), including a $2.3 million payment on its convertible trust preferred securities. Current borrowings under the Company's bank
facilities are $56 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of two separate issuances of senior notes that in the aggregate total $300 million. Capitalized interest for the third quarter of 2002 is expected to be about $2.2 million. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the third quarter of 2002 to be about 35%. The Company provides information regarding its outstanding hedging positions in its annual report and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and in its electronic publication -- @NFX. This publication can be found on the Company's web page at http://www.newfld.com. Through the web page, stockholders can elect to receive @NFX through e-mail distribution. FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain of the statements set forth above regarding estimated or anticipated third quarter 2002 results, capital spending and yearly production volumes are forward-looking and based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services and the availability of capital resources, labor conditions and other factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
