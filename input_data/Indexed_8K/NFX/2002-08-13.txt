The Securities specified in such Pricing Agreement are referred to as the "Firm Designated Securities" with respect to such Pricing Agreement. If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional principal amount of Securities specified as provided in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and the Optional Designated Securities, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively referred to as the "Designated Securities." The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing Agreement. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities, the maximum principal amount of Optional Designated Securities, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm and Optional
Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm Designated Securities and Optional Designated Securities, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the Registration Statement and Prospectus (as defined) with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-71348) (as amended prior to being declared effective, the "Initial Registration Statement") in respect of the Securities, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); the Initial Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives (excluding exhibits to the Initial Registration Statement, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained therein), have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement, if any, increasing the size of the offering (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), which became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to the Initial Registration Statement or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission (other than documents heretofore delivered to the Representatives); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Initial Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission; any preliminary prospectus included in the Initial Registration Statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Act and relating to the Securities, is hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of the Initial Registration Statement (other than any parts solely relating to securities other than the Securities), any post-effective amendment thereto and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus (other than exhibits and documents solely relating to securities other than the Securities) contained in the Initial Registration Statement at the time such part of the Initial Registration Statement became effective but excluding Forms T-1, each as amended at the time such part of the Initial Registration Statement became effective or such part of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, became or hereafter becomes effective, are hereinafter collectively called the "Registration Statement"; the prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, in the form in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the 2

given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Designated Securities, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First Time of Delivery, being herein called the "Second Time of Delivery". Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery." If the Designated Securities are redeemed pursuant to the Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined in the Prospectus), then concurrently with the Special Mandatory Redemption, the Underwriters, severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, will pay to the Company by wire transfer of Federal (same day) funds to an account designated by the Company an amount of money equal to one-half (1/2) of the underwriting discount set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities. 5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities: (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and prior to any Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Designated Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after any Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Designated Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Designated Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Securities or suspending any such qualification, promptly to use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such 9

The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to such Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; 11

subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties, except for any such conflicts or breaches that would not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the issue or sale of the Designated Securities by the Company, or the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture by the Company or have a material adverse effect on the financial position, stockholders' equity, results of operations or business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (except that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws with respect to this subparagraph); (vi) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities being delivered at such Time of Delivery or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws; (vii) The statements set forth in the Prospectus as amended and supplemented under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Designated Securities or the Indenture and under the caption "Underwriting" and "Plan of Distribution", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate in all material respects; (viii) The Designated Securities are in the form prescribed in or pursuant to the Indenture, have been duly and validly authorized by the Company by all necessary corporate action and, when executed and authenticated as specified in or pursuant to the Indenture and issued and delivered, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, and will be enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Designated Securities and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus and in the Prospectus as amended and supplemented; the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; (ix) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; 13
(x) The Company is not an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act; (xi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xii) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; although such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinions in subsections (ii), (vii) and (viii) of this Section 7(c), such counsel has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that, as of such Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or 14
other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and they do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Company or its subsidiaries who have audited the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (e) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of EEX Corporation and its subsidiaries who have audited the EEX Corporation financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto as applicable with respect to EEX Corporation's financial statements and related information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the 15
Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities; (g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock or other preferred securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock; (h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York or Texas State authorities; or (iv) (A) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls, (B) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States, or (C) any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international calamity or emergency, if the effect of any such event specified in this Clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities or both on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (i) The Designated Securities at each Time of Delivery shall have been approved for listing, subject to notice of issuance, on any exchange or market listed in the Pricing Agreement; (j) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the second business day succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities (or such other date as set forth in the Pricing Agreement); and (k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) 16
of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter (including any Independent Underwriter named in the Pricing Agreement in its role as a "qualified independent underwriter" of the Designated Securities within the meaning of Section (b)(15) of Rule 2720 of the Conduct Rules of the NASD) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Designated Securities. The Company also will indemnify and hold harmless any Independent Underwriter from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments incurred as a result of the Independent Underwriter's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Conduct Rules of the NASD in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities, except for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments found in a final judgment by a court to have resulted from the Independent Underwriter's willful misconduct or gross negligence. (b) Each Underwriter will, severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such 17
Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. If indemnity is sought pursuant to the second paragraph of subsection (a) of this Section 8, then, in addition to such counsel for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate counsel (in addition to any necessary local counsel) for any Independent Underwriter in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter," if, in the reasonable judgment of the Independent Underwriter there may exist a conflict of interest between the Independent Underwriter and the other indemnified parties. In the case of any such separate counsel for the Independent Underwriter, such counsel shall be designated in writing by the Independent Underwriter. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which 18
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities or any Independent Underwriter, as applicable, on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities or the Independent Underwriter, as applicable, on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters or any Independent Underwriter, as applicable, on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters, or the Independent Underwriter, as applicable, on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission and, in the case of any Independent Underwriter, whether its activities as Independent Underwriter under its engagement involved any gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter (including any Independent Underwriter) shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter (including any Independent Underwriter) has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be 19
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Designated Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased is not 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase 20
under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased is 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities. 11. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to 21
the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or communication constituting such Questionnaire, or otherwise furnished to the Representatives, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14.

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or that modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions under this Indenture relating to the Company's obligations to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or amended with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. An amendment under this Section 902 may not make any change that would adversely affect the rights under Article Fourteen or Sixteen of any holder of Senior Indebtedness then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or their Representatives) consent to such change or unless the notes, debentures, bonds or other similar instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness so permit.

Delivery of the reports, information and documents specified in the preceding paragraph to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely on Officers' Certificates).

(d) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 1010, any Indebtedness remaining outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be treated as Incurred on such date under Section 1010(b)(1). Further, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described above (including Section 1010(a)), (1) the Company, in its sole discretion, may classify such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) as of the time of Incurrence, in any manner that complies with this Section 1010, (2) the Company will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the above categories and (3) the Company shall be entitled to divide and classify such item of Indebtedness in more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in Section 1010(a) or 1010(b).

Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured. 40
SECTION 1011. Limitation on Restricted Payments.

SECTION 1014. Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value (including the value of all non-cash consideration) as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, an Officer or an officer of such Restricted Subsidiary with responsibility for such transaction, which determination shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision, of the shares or assets subject to such Asset Disposition; (2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash, cash equivalents, oil and natural gas 46
properties or capital assets to be used by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the Oil and Gas Business; and (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) (A) first, to the extent the Company so elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), to prepay, repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value Senior Indebtedness (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of a Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; (B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent the Company so elects, to acquire Additional Assets or make capital expenditures in the Oil and Gas Business within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B), to make an offer to the Holders of the 8 3/8% Notes (and to holders of other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company designated by the Company) to purchase 8 3/8% Notes (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to and subject to the conditions of this Section 1014; provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A) or (C) of this Section 1014(a)(3), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Indebtedness and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1014, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 1014 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with this Section 1014(a) exceeds $20 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 1014(a), such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness. For the purposes of clause (a)(2) of this Section 1014, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents: (1) the release of, pursuant to a novation or other agreement, or the discharge of, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; and (2) securities received by the Company or any 47
Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 120 days of their receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1014 shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Disposition in which the cash or cash equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Disposition complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation. The requirement of Section 1014(a)(3)(B) shall be deemed satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or expenditures referred to therein is entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary within the time period specified in such clause and such Net Available Cash is subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months following such agreement. (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of 8 3/8% Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to Section 1014(a)(3)(C), the Company shall make such offer to purchase 8 3/8% Notes (the "Offer") on or before the 366th day after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, and will purchase 8 3/8% Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer by the Company for the 8 3/8% Notes (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of 8 3/8% Notes and any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company shall select the 8 3/8% Notes and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the 8 3/8% Notes shall be denominations of $1,000 principal amount or multiples thereof. The Company shall not be required to make such an Offer to purchase 8 3/8% Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 1014 if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $20 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). (c) (1) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have its 8 3/8% Notes purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 1014(b) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount, at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good 48
faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision and all instructions and materials necessary to tender 8 3/8% Notes pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3). (2) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided above, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness included in the Offer, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 1014(a) and (b). On or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the 8 3/8% Notes or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the 8 3/8% Notes delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the 8 3/8% Notes, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period. Upon completion of an Offer, Net Available Cash shall be deemed to be reduced by the Offer Amount. (3) Holders electing to have an 8 3/8% Notes purchased shall be required to surrender the 8 3/8% Note, with the form "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such 8 3/8% Notes purchased. Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part shall be issued new 8 3/8% Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the 8 3/8% Notes surrendered. (4) At the time the Company delivers 8 3/8% Notes to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such 8 3/8% Notes are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section. An 8 3/8% Note shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder. 49
(d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of 8 3/8% Notes pursuant to this Section. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. SECTION 1015. Limitation on Affiliate Transactions. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property, employee compensation arrangements or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (an "Affiliate Transaction") unless: (1) the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time of the Affiliate Transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not an Affiliate; (2) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $15 million, the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and a majority of the non-employee directors of the Company disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction shall have determined in good faith that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied and shall have approved the relevant Affiliate Transaction as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and (3) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $30 million, the Board of Directors shall have received a written opinion from an Independent Qualified Party to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or is not less favorable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arm's-length transaction with a Person who was not an Affiliate. (b) The provisions of Section 1015(a) shall not prohibit: (1) any Investment or other Restricted Payment, in each case not prohibited to be made pursuant to Section 1011; (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans and other benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors; (3) loans or advances to officers, directors and employees who are Affiliates in the ordinary course of business of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, but in 50
any event not to exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate outstanding at any one time; (4) any transaction between or among the Company, a Restricted Subsidiary or joint venture or similar Person that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Restricted Subsidiary, joint venture or similar Person; (5) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; (6) reasonable fees and reasonable compensation paid to, and indemnity and similar arrangements provided on behalf of, officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company's senior management; and (7) any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date and described in the prospectus pursuant to which the 8 3/8% Notes were offered and sold, or any renewals or extensions of any such agreement (so long as such renewals or extensions are not less favorable to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby. SECTION 1016. Change of Control. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, then unless the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem all the 8 3/8% Notes, each Holder shall have the right to require that the Company repurchase such Holder's 8 3/8% Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of the purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date), in accordance with the terms contemplated in Section 1016(b). (b) Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the 8 3/8% Notes and shall have delivered an irrevocable notice of redemption to the Trustee, then within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee (the "Change of Control Offer") stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase such Holder's 8 3/8% Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant Interest Payment Date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization, in each case after giving effect to such Change of Control); 51
(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions, as determined by the Company, consistent with this Section 1016, that a Holder must follow in order to have its 8 3/8% Notes purchased. (c) Holders electing to have an 8 3/8% Note purchased will be required to surrender the 8 3/8% Note, with the "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the purchase date. Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the purchase date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the 8 3/8% Note which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such 8 3/8% Note purchased. (d) On the purchase date, all 8 3/8% Notes purchased by the Company under this Section shall be delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall pay the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Holders entitled thereto. (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 1016 and purchases all 8 3/8% Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. (f) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of 8 3/8% Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. SECTION 1017. Future Guarantors. The Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that Guarantees or secures any Indebtedness of the Company to, at the same time, execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Securities on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in this Indenture. SECTION 1018. Covenant Suspension. (a) During any period that the 8 3/8% Notes have a rating equal to or higher than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's (each, an "Investment Grade Rating") and no Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to 52
Sections 1010(a) through (d), 1011, 1012, 1014, 1015, 1017 and 801(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). (b) In the event that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the operation of clause (a) of this Section 1018, and subsequently one or both of S&P and Moody's downgrades the rating assigned to the 8 3/8% Notes below their respective Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants (subject to subsequent suspension of the 8 3/8% Notes again receive Investment Grade Ratings), and, with respect to Restricted Payments proposed to be made after the time of such downgrade, the permissibility of such proposed Restricted Payments will be calculated in accordance with Section 1011 as though Section 1011 had been in effect since the Issue Date, it being understood, however, that no actions taken by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary during the suspension period shall constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Suspended Covenants. SECTION 6. Amendments to Article Eleven of the Original Indenture. (a) Section 1105 of the Original Indenture is amended with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes in its entirety to read as follows: On or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Redemption Date for any 8 3/8% Notes, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money, in immediately available funds, sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date) such Securities or any portions thereof that are to be redeemed on that date, it being understood that the amount of money to be deposited by the Company in relation to a mandatory redemption pursuant to Section 1109 shall take into consideration the amount of money deposited by the Escrow Agent with the Trustee or a Paying Agent to fund such redemption. (b) Section 1107 of the Original Indenture is amended with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes to add the following paragraph thereto: Any 8 3/8% Note of $1,000 or less principal amount shall be redeemed only as a whole and not in part. (c) Article Eleven of the Original Indenture is amended with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes by adding Sections 1108, 1109 and 1110 as follows: SECTION 1108. Optional Redemption. (a) Except as set forth in the following paragraphs of this Section 1108, the 8 3/8% Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Company prior to August 15, 2007. Starting on 53
that date, the Company may redeem all or any portion of the 8 3/8% Notes, upon no less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at the Redemption Prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). The following prices are for 8 3/8% Notes redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on August 15 of the years set forth below, and are expressed as percentages of principal amount: Redemption Year Price ------------------- ---------- 2007 104.188% 2008 102.792% 2009 101.405% 2010 and thereafter 100.000% (b) The Company may on any one or more occasions prior to August 15, 2005, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes (including any Additional 8 3/8% Notes) originally issued prior to the Redemption Date with the Net Proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings at a Redemption Price of 108.375% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date, provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes (including any Additional 8 3/8% Notes) originally issued prior to the Redemption Date remains Outstanding after the occurrence of such redemption. Any such redemption shall occur not later than 90 days after the date of the closing of any such Public Equity Offering upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice. The redemption shall be made in accordance with procedures set forth in this Indenture. (c) At any time prior to August 15, 2007, the Company may redeem the 8 3/8% Notes at its option, as a whole, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the Redemption Date. For purposes of Section 1104, it shall be sufficient if a notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 1108(c) shall describe the method for determining the Redemption Price in lieu of stating the Redemption Price. SECTION 1109. Mandatory Redemption. Following the occurrence of the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger, the Company shall redeem the 8 3/8% Notes as a whole, upon notice as provided in this Section 1109, at a Redemption Price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1104, notice of such mandatory redemption shall be given within ten days of the date of the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, to the Escrow Agent and to each Noteholder, at his address appearing in the Security Register, and such notice shall state: (1) that the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger has occurred; 54
(2) the Redemption Date; (3) the Redemption Price; (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each 8 3/8% Note to be redeemed and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after such date; and (5) the place or places where each 8 3/8% Note is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price. Any notice of redemption given pursuant to this Article Eleven may be modified by the Company to conform with the applicable requirements of the Depositary if any of the Securities subject to such notice are then represented by one or more Global Securities. SECTION 1110. No Mandatory Sinking Fund. There will be no mandatory sinking fund payments for the 8 3/8% Notes, except as provided in Section 1109. SECTION 7. Amendments to Article Thirteen the Original Indenture. (a) Section 1302 of the Original Indenture is amended in its entirety with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes to read as follows: SECTION 1302. Defeasance and Discharge. Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to the 8 3/8% Notes, (i) the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations hereunder as provided in this Section, (ii) payment of the 8 3/8% Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto and (iii) the provisions of Articles Fourteen through Sixteen shall cease to be effective with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the 8 3/8% Notes and to have satisfied all its other obligations under the 8 3/8% Notes and this Indenture insofar as the 8 3/8% Notes are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following, which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of the 8 3/8% Notes to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on the 8 3/8% Notes when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to the 8 3/8% Notes notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 1303 applied to the 8 3/8% Notes. 55
(b) Section 1303 of the Original Indenture is amended in its entirety with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes to read as follows: SECTION 1303. Covenant Defeasance. Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to the 8 3/8% Notes, (i) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 801(a)(3), Sections 1005 through 1017, inclusive, (ii) payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (4), clause (5) (with respect only to Subsidiary Guarantors or Significant Subsidiaries), clause (6) (with respect only to Subsidiary Guarantors or Significant Subsidiaries), clause (7), clause (8) or clause (9) of Section 501 or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 801(a)(3) and (iii) the provisions of Articles Fourteen through Sixteen shall cease to be effective with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section or Article Fourteen, Fifteen or Sixteen, whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or Article Fourteen, Fifteen or Sixteen, or by reason of any reference in any such Section or Article to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and the 8 3/8% Notes shall be unaffected thereby. SECTION 8. Amendments to Article Fourteen of the Original Indenture. (a) Article Fourteen of the Original Indenture is superseded with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes by the following provisions: ARTICLE FOURTEEN SUBORDINATION SECTION 1401. Agreement to Subordinate. The Company agrees, and each Noteholder by accepting an 8 3/8% Note agrees, that the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 8 3/8% Notes and any other payment obligation of the Company in respect of the 8 3/8% Notes (including any obligation to purchase 8 3/8% Notes) is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Fourteen, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, including the obligations of the Company under the Revolving Credit Facility, and that the subordination is for the benefit of and shall be enforceable directly by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The 8 3/8% Notes shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company and only Indebtedness of the Company that is Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall rank senior to the 8 3/8% Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article Fourteen shall be subject to Section 1412. SECTION 1402. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. 56
Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company upon a liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property: (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of such Senior Indebtedness before Noteholders shall be entitled to receive any payment; and (2) until such Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash or cash equivalents, any payment or distribution to which Noteholders would be entitled but for this Article Fourteen shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Noteholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the 8 3/8% Notes. SECTION 1403. Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company. The Company shall not pay the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 8 3/8% Notes or any other payment obligation in respect of the 8 3/8% Notes (including any obligation to purchase the 8 3/8% Notes) or make any deposit pursuant to Article Thirteen and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any 8 3/8% Notes (collectively, "pay the 8 3/8% Notes") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs: (1) any Obligation on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the 8 3/8% Notes without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the 8 3/8% Notes for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee and the Company of a written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the 57
Company shall be permitted to resume payments on the 8 3/8% Notes after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The 8 3/8% Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period; provided, however, that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. SECTION 1404. Acceleration of Payment of 8 3/8% Notes. If payment of the 8 3/8% Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or their Representatives) of the acceleration. SECTION 1405. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over; Reinstatement of Senior Indebtedness. If a distribution is made to Noteholders that because of this Article Fourteen should not have been made to them, the Noteholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear. To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of the Company as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. SECTION 1406. Subrogation. After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the 8 3/8% Notes are paid in full, Noteholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Fourteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Noteholders is not, as between the Company and Noteholders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 1407. Relative Rights. This Article Fourteen defines the relative rights of Noteholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall: 58
(1) impair, as between the Company and Noteholders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the 8 3/8% Notes in accordance with their terms; or (2) prevent the Trustee or any Noteholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Noteholders. SECTION 1408. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company. No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as provided in this Indenture will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by noncompliance by the Company with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Senior Indebtedness may have or otherwise be charged with. SECTION 1409. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent; Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness. Notwithstanding Section 1403, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the 8 3/8% Notes and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article Fourteen would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article Fourteen. The Company, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Fourteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607. The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time subject to the terms of such Senior Indebtedness, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Noteholders, without incurring responsibility to the Noteholders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Indenture or the obligations hereunder of the Noteholders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding or secured; 59
(2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; and (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person. SECTION 1410. Distribution or Notice to Representative. Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any). SECTION 1411. Article Fourteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate. The failure to make a payment pursuant to the 8 3/8% Notes by reason of any provision in this Article Fourteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall have any effect on the right of the Noteholders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the 8 3/8% Notes. SECTION 1412. Trust Moneys and Escrow Funds Not Subordinated. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from either (i) money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article Thirteen by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the 8 3/8% Notes or (ii) any funds received by the Trustee or Paying Agent from the Escrow Agent following the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Fourteen, and none of the Noteholders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company. SECTION 1413. Trustee Entitled to Rely. Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 1402 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or (3) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Fourteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior 60
Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Fourteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 601 and 603 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Fourteen. SECTION 1414. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each Noteholder by accepting an 8 3/8% Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. SECTION 1415. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Noteholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fourteen or otherwise. SECTION 1416. Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions. Each Noteholder by accepting an 8 3/8% Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the 8 3/8% Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 9. Subsidiary Guaranties. (a) The Original Indenture is amended with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes by adding Articles Fifteen and Sixteen as follows: ARTICLE FIFTEEN SUBSIDIARY GUARANTIES SECTION 1501. Guaranties. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the 8 3/8% Notes when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the 61
Company under this Indenture and the 8 3/8% Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the 8 3/8% Notes (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guarantied Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantied Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article Fifteen notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantied Obligation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantied Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the 8 3/8% Notes or the Guarantied Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the 8 3/8% Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the 8 3/8% Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantied Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 1506, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guarantied Obligations. Each Subsidiary Guaranty is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in Article Sixteen, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor giving such Subsidiary Guaranty and each Subsidiary Guaranty is made subject to such provisions of this Indenture. Except as expressly set forth in Sections 1502 and 1506, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the 8 3/8% Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, except for the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. 62
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guarantied Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guarantied Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guarantied Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guarantied Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantied Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guarantied Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in respect of any Guarantied Obligations until payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations and all obligations to which the Guarantied Obligations are subordinated as provided in Article Sixteen. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantied Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article Five for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guarantied Obligations as provided in Article Five, such Guarantied Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section. Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section. SECTION 1502. Limitation on Liability. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. SECTION 1503. Successors and Assigns. This Article Fifteen shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the 8 3/8% Notes shall 63
automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture. SECTION 1504. No Waiver. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article Fifteen shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article Fifteen at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. SECTION 1505. Modification. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article Fifteen, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. SECTION 1506. Release of Subsidiary Guarantor. Upon (1) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) and as permitted by this Indenture, (2) the liquidation and dissolution of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (3) the exercise by the Company of its option to effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance pursuant to Article Thirteen or (4) the designation of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Indenture and the 8 3/8% Notes without any further action required on the part of the Trustee, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release. SECTION 1507 Contribution. Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment under its Subsidiary Guaranty shall be entitled upon payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. ARTICLE SIXTEEN SUBORDINATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTIES SECTION 1601. Agreement to Subordinate. 64
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Noteholder by accepting an 8 3/8% Note agrees, that the payment of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty (including any amounts in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 8 3/8% Notes and any other payment obligation in respect of the 8 3/8% Notes, including any obligation of the Company to purchase 8 3/8% Notes) is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Sixteen, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and that the subordination is for the benefit of and shall be enforceable directly by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Guarantied Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall rank senior to the Guarantied Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article Sixteen shall be subject to Section 1612. SECTION 1602. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor upon a liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property: (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of such Senior Indebtedness before Noteholders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash or cash equivalents, any payment or distribution to which Noteholders would be entitled but for this Article Sixteen shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Noteholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as its Subsidiary Guaranty. SECTION 1603. Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make any payment under its Subsidiary Guaranty, whether in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 8 3/8% Notes or any other payment obligation in respect of the 8 3/8% Notes (including any obligation of the Company to purchase 8 3/8% Notes) or make any deposit pursuant to Article Thirteen and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any 8 3/8% Notes or other Guarantied Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; provided, however, that any 65
Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor of written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be permitted to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period; provided, however, that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. SECTION 1604. Demand for Payment. If a demand for payment is made by the Trustee on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article Fifteen, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand. SECTION 1605. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over; Reinstatement of Senior Indebtedness. If a distribution is made to Noteholders that because of this Article Sixteen should not have been made to them, the Noteholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear. To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Guarantor as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid 66
to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. SECTION 1606. Subrogation. After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the 8 3/8% Notes are paid in full, Noteholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article Sixteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Noteholders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Noteholders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 1607. Relative Rights. This Article Sixteen defines the relative rights of Noteholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall: (1) impair, as between a Subsidiary Guarantor and Noteholders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty to the extent set forth in Article Fifteen; or (2) prevent the Trustee or any Noteholder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Noteholders. SECTION 1608. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company. No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce subordination as provided in this Indenture will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by noncompliance by such Subsidiary Guarantor with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such Holder of Senior Indebtedness may have or otherwise be charged with. SECTION 1609. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent; Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness. Notwithstanding Section 1603, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article Sixteen would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article Sixteen. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled 67
to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Sixteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607. The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time subject to the terms of such Senior Indebtedness, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Noteholders, without incurring responsibility to the Noteholders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Indenture or the obligations hereunder of the Noteholders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding or secured; (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; and (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Subsidiary Guarantor and any other Person. SECTION 1610. Distribution or Notice to Representative. Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any). SECTION 1611. Article Sixteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment. The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article Sixteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall have any effect on the right of the Noteholders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty. SECTION 1612. Trust Moneys and Escrow Funds Not Subordinated. 68
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from either (i) money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article Thirteen by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the 8 3/8% Notes or (ii) any funds received by the Trustee or Paying Agent from the Escrow Agent following the Special Mandatory Redemption Date shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Sixteen, and none of the Noteholders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to any Subsidiary Guarantor or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other creditor of any Subsidiary Guarantor. SECTION 1613. Trustee Entitled to Rely. Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 1602 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Sixteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Sixteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 601 and 603 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Sixteen. SECTION 1614. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each Noteholder by accepting an 8 3/8% Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article Sixteen and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. SECTION 1615. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Noteholders or the Company or any other Person, money or 69
assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Sixteen or otherwise. SECTION 1616. Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors on Subordination Provisions. Each Noteholder by accepting an 8 3/8% Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the 8 3/8% Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 10. Governing Law. This First Supplemental Indenture and the 8 3/8% Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. SECTION 11. Counterparts. This First Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. SECTION 12. Supplemental Indenture Controls. In the event there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Original Indenture and this First Supplemental Indenture, the provisions of this First Supplemental Indenture shall control. 70

[FORM OF THE REVERSE OF 8 3/8% NOTE] NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY 8 3/8% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTE DUE 2012 1. Indenture; Limitations. The Company issued the 8 3/8% Notes under the Subordinated Indenture dated as of December 10, 2001 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 13, 2002 (the Original Indenture as so supplemented and amended being hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") . Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated. The terms of the 8 3/8% Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The 8 3/8% Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this 8 3/8% Note and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall control. The 8 3/8% Notes are senior subordinated obligations of the Company and the aggregate principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes which may be issued, executed, authenticated, delivered and outstanding is unlimited (subject to Section 1 of the First Supplemental Indenture). The Company may, subject to Section 1010 of the Indenture, issue Additional 8 3/8% Notes under the Indenture in either a limited or an unlimited aggregate principal amount. This 8 3/8% Note is one of the Original 8 3/8% Notes referred to in the Indenture issued in an aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000. The Additional 8 3/8% Notes may be issued as part of the same or a different series of Securities as the Original 8 3/8% Notes, but all such 8 3/8% Notes shall be treated as a single class under the Indenture. 2. Principal and Interest. The Company will pay the principal of this 8 3/8% Note on August 15, 2012. The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this 8 3/8% Note on each February 15 and August 15 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), as set forth below, at the rate per annum shown above. Interest will be payable semiannually (to the holders of record of the 8 3/8% Notes at the close of business on the February 1 or August 1 immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date) on each Interest Payment Date, commencing February 15, 2003. A-3
Interest on the 8 3/8% Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from August 13, 2002, provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest and this 8 3/8% Note is authenticated between a Regular Record Date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such Interest Payment Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the 8 3/8% Notes plus 1% per annum, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest, to the extent lawful, at the rate borne by the 8 3/8% Notes. 3. Method of Payment. The Company will pay interest (except Defaulted Interest) on the principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes as provided above on each Interest Payment Date to the persons who are Holders (as reflected in the Security Register at the close of business on the February 1 and August 1 immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date), in each case, even if the 8 3/8% Note is canceled on registration of transfer, registration of exchange, redemption or repurchase after such record date and on or before the Interest Payment Date, provided that, with respect to the payment of principal, the Company will make payment to the Holder that surrenders this 8 3/8% Note to a Paying Agent on or after its Maturity. The Company will pay principal, premium, if any, and as provided above, interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company, at its option, may pay principal, premium, if any, and interest by its check payable in such money. It may mail an interest check to a Holder's registered address (as reflected in the Security Register). Payments in respect of 8 3/8% Notes represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. If a payment date is a date other than a Business Day at a place of payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period. 4. Paying Agent and Security Registrar. Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar in relation to the 8 3/8% Notes. The Company may change any authenticating agent, paying agent or Registrar without notice. A-4
5. Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The 8 3/8% Notes are subject to both optional and mandatory redemption, either as a whole or in some cases in part, at the times, under the circumstances, upon the giving of prior notices to Holders and at the Redemption Prices described in Article Eleven of the Indenture. 6. Escrow. The underwriters of the Original 8 3/8% Notes have deposited the net proceeds of the offering thereof with the Escrow Agent on the Issue Date. The Escrow Agent will hold such funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and, subject to the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement, it will either disburse such funds to the Company or disburse them to the Trustee or the Paying Agent for application to the mandatory redemption of the Original 8 3/8% Notes following the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger. 7. Subordination. The 8 3/8% Notes are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Indebtedness of the Company must be paid before the 8 3/8% Notes may be paid. The Company and each Holder by accepting a 8 3/8% Note agrees to the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture and authorize the Trustee to give it effect and appoint the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose. 8. Repurchase upon a Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of 8 3/8% Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder's 8 3/8% Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date). 9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The 8 3/8% Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register the transfer of or exchange 8 3/8% Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the transaction. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any 8 3/8% Notes selected or called for redemption (except in the case of a 8 3/8% Note redeemed in part, the portion of the 8 3/8% Note not to be redeemed). Also, it need not register the transfer or exchange of any 8 3/8% Notes for a period of A-5
15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of 8 3/8% Notes selected for redemption. 10. Persons Deemed Owners. A Holder shall be treated as the owner of a 8 3/8% Note for all purposes. 11. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its written request, unless an abandoned property law provides otherwise. After that, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment, and all liability of the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease. 12. Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity. Subject to certain conditions, if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the then outstanding principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 8 3/8% Notes to redemption or Stated Maturity, as applicable, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, may terminate some of or all of their obligations under the Indenture and the 8 3/8% Notes, all as provided in Articles Four and Thirteen of the Indenture. 13.

The Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (g) above) with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes at the time Outstanding shall occur and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 8 3/8% Notes by notice as provided in the Indenture may declare the principal amount of the 8 3/8% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (g) above with respect to the 8 3/8% Notes at the time Outstanding shall occur, the principal amount of all the 8 3/8% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will automatically, and without any action by the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 8 3/8% Notes may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture. 17. Trustee Dealings with the Company or the Guarantors. The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, or the Company or their Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, or the Company or their Affiliates as if it were not the Trustee. 18. No Recourse Against Others. No incorporator or any past, present or future partner, stockholder, other equity holder, officer, director, employee or controlling Person as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the 8 3/8% Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a 8 3/8% Note expressly waives and releases all such liability.

The Notes are being offered, issued and sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement and a pricing agreement (collectively, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters of such offering. In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined or are familiar with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date, and have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of the Indenture, the form of Supplemental Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and corporate records of the Company, including minute books of the Company as furnished to us by the Company, certificates of representatives of the Company, and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained in such certificates.

We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company and to the incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement.
