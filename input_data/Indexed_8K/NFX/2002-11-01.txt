ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On October 31, 2002, Newfield Exploration Company ("Newfield" or the "Company") announced its financial and operating results for the third quarter and year-to-date 2002. Set forth below is a portion of the press release. THIRD QUARTER 2002 For the third quarter of 2002, Newfield reported net income of $18.4 million, or $0.41 per share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis), stated before the effect of a non-cash charge related to SFAS 133. Stated after the effect of the non-cash charge, net income for the third quarter of 2002 was $9.4 million, or $0.21 per share. This compares to net income in the third quarter of 2001 of $35.8 million, or $0.76 per share, stated before the effect of a non-cash gain related to SFAS 133. Stated with the effect of the gain, earnings for the third quarter of 2001 were $43.0 million, or $0.91 per share. Revenues in the third quarter of 2002 were $152.6 million compared to $183.3 million in the same period of 2001. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital for the third quarter of 2002 was $86.2 million, or $1.92 per share, compared to $129.9 million, or $2.69 per share, in the same period of 2001. Operating cash flow in the third quarter of 2002 was negatively impacted by lower realized natural gas prices and higher current taxes. Tropical Storm Isidore adversely impacted financial and operating results in the third quarter of 2002. Newfield was forced to shut-in a total of approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) of production in the Gulf of Mexico in late September. Newfield's total production for the third quarter of 2002 was 44.2 Bcfe, or 481 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d). Production in the third quarter declined 3% over the third quarter of 2001 primarily due to lower oil production and weather-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico. Production in the third quarter of 2001 was 45.7 Bcfe, or 497 MMcfe/d. The following tables detail quarterly production and average realized prices: 2
- --------------------------------------------------- *Prices shown are net of transportation expense and after hedging. The Company has not entered into hedging transactions specifically relating to Australian production. Newfield's LOE in the third quarter of 2002, stated on a unit of production basis, was $0.57 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe). This compares to $0.66 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2001. LOE was higher in the third quarter of 2001 primarily because of a one-time $5.5 million charge related to workover expense on a Gulf of Mexico well. DD&A expense for the third quarter of 2002 was $1.64 per Mcfe compared to $1.63 per Mcfe in the same period of 2001. Newfield's general and administrative expense (including stock compensation) in the third quarter of 2002 was $0.31 per Mcfe compared to $0.27 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2001. Higher G&A expense per unit reflects lower production in the third quarter of 2002 and the Company's growing workforce. Net interest expense decreased slightly to $0.13 per Mcfe compared to $0.14 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2001. YEAR-TO-DATE 2002 For the first nine months of 2002, Newfield reported net income of $58.5 million, or $1.29 per share, stated before the effect of a non-cash charge related to SFAS 133. Stated after the effect of the non-cash charge, net income for the first nine months of 2002 was $42.0 million, or $0.93 per share. This compares to net income in the first nine months of 2001 of $152.9 million, or $3.21 per share, stated before the effect of a non-cash gain related to SFAS 133. Stated with the effect of the gain, earnings for the first nine months of 2001 were $158.1 million, or $3.32 per share. Revenues for the first nine months of 2002 were $462.3 million. For the same period of 2001, they were $593.3 million. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital decreased to $282.6 million, or $6.29 per share, in the first three quarters of 2002 compared to $415.6 million, or $8.57 per share, in the same period of 2001. The decreases reflect lower commodity prices and, in the case of operating cash flow, higher current taxes. 3

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On October 31, 2002, Newfield issued a press release that contained estimates of certain significant operating and financial data for the fourth quarter of 2002 and some preliminary guidance on the impact of the pending acquisition of EEX Corporation. These estimates and preliminary guidance are set forth below. FOURTH QUARTER 2002 ESTIMATES Below are estimates of certain significant operating and financial data for the fourth quarter of 2002. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. THE INFORMATION RELATED TO NEWFIELD'S FOURTH QUARTER EXPECTATIONS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S PENDING ACQUISITION OF EEX CORPORATION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN LATE NOVEMBER 2002. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information set forth below. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING Newfield's natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2002 is expected to be 34 - 35 Bcf (370 - 380 MMcf/d). The price received by the Company for its natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from the Company's Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Consolidated oil production in the fourth quarter of 2002 is expected to be 1.5 - 1.6 million barrels (16,300 - 17,400 BOPD). Australian oil production during the fourth quarter is expected to be 240 - 250 thousand barrels (2,600 - 2,700 BOPD). The oil volume estimate for the Company's Australian production reflects production downtime associated with annual maintenance on the production facilities and the timing of expected liftings. Both events will impact reported production and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2002. The price the Company receives from its Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Australian crude oil sales are based on the Tapis Benchmark, which has historically been comparable to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. For the full-year 2002, the Company expects to produce about 180 Bcfe, an increase of 3% over 2001 production. Due to recent storms in the Gulf of Mexico, the Company was forced to shut-in a total of about 4 Bcfe of production. LEASE OPERATING EXPENSE AND PRODUCTION AND OTHER TAXES Newfield's LOE, including domestic production and severance taxes and resource rent tax in Australia, is expected to be $31 - $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 ($0.72 - $0.79 per Mcfe). The Company's domestic LOE, including taxes, is expected to be $0.62 - $0.68 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2002. This estimate includes severance taxes of $0.10 - $0.12 per Mcfe. LOE varies and is subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE Newfield's G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2002 is expected to be $12.3 - $13.6 million ($0.28 - $0.32 per Mcfe). This estimate includes accrual of performance-based pay. 8
INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2002 is expected to be $6 - $7 million ($0.14 - $0.16 per Mcfe), including a $2.3 million payment on its convertible trust preferred securities. Current borrowings under Newfield's bank facilities are about $45 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of two separate issuances of senior notes that in the aggregate total $300 million. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2002 is expected to be about $2.2 million. The proceeds from the Company's recent $250 million senior subordinated notes offering are being held in escrow pending the closing of the EEX acquisition, and no interest expense with respect to the notes will be accrued prior to closing. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2002 to be about 35%. Current taxes for the full-year 2002 are expected to be about $44 million. The Company expects that the entire tax expense in the fourth quarter will be current. KEY FACTS RELATING TO EEX ACQUISITION: The following is some preliminary guidance on the impact of the EEX acquisition. Additional guidance will be given following the close of this transaction. o The S-4 registration statement was declared effective on October 10 and proxies were mailed to EEX shareholders. EEX shareholders will vote on the transaction November 26. o Newfield is planning to drill about 35 development wells and 8-10 exploration wells on EEX's acreage in 2003. o Newfield expects to reduce EEX's 2003 ongoing G&A expense by at least 50% versus 2002. o Newfield expects to invest $70-75 million in 2003 on the properties acquired from EEX. This is double the current investment level on these properties. Areas of significant activity are expected to include: - The Monte Christo Field: (EEX 20-40% working interest) The Company is planning to participate in a five-well development program. One exploration well is also planned. - Fashing: (EEX 49% working interest) This is a mature field discovered in the 1950s with cumulative production of more than 1.5 Tcfe. Newfield is planning to drill seven development wells in the field next year, work to lower field reservoir pressure and increase reserve recovery, and analyze the field's geology for exploration/exploitation drilling potential. - Dinn Ranch: (Joint operatorship, 35-50% EEX working interest) Significant discoveries were made in this field over the last two years. Current gross production capacity is about 80 MMcf/d and an active development drilling program is planned for 2003. - Vaquillas Ranch: (EEX working interest 100%) Newfield is planning to drill at least three development wells in the field in 2003. In addition, a field study is also planned to identify additional drilling opportunities. - The Val Verde Basin: (EEX operated, working interest varies between 45-100%) The Company plans to focus efforts on the Val Verde Basin of southwest Texas. Newfield is planning to drill at least one exploration well and at least five development wells and invest in new seismic acquisition and processing.
