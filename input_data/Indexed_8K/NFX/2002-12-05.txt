Employer of Incorporation) Identification No.) 363 N.

Item 5. Other Events As previously announced, Newfield Exploration Company ("Newfield") acquired EEX Corporation ("EEX") on November 26, 2002 by the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield with and into EEX (the "Merger"). It was a condition to Newfield's obligation to complete the Merger that, contemporaneously with the Merger, EEX would cause the termination of a gas sales obligation between one of its subsidiaries and an affiliate of Enron North America and would effect certain other actions in connection with the termination of the gas sales obligation (collectively, the "Unwind"). Prior to the closing of the Merger, Newfield waived EEX's obligation to complete the Unwind. Because the completion of the Unwind prior to the scheduled closing of the Merger remained uncertain, Newfield sought approval from the banks under its Credit Agreement dated as of May 1, 2001 (the "Credit Agreement") to close the Merger without completion of the Unwind. Newfield and the banks entered into a Fourth Amendment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2002 (the "Amendment") that amended the Credit Agreement to permit the closing of the Merger without completion of the Unwind. Until completion of the Unwind, the Amendment provides in general that the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement will be reduced by the greater of $60 million or the cost to complete the Unwind. Based on current gas prices, the cost to complete the Unwind is less than $60 million. However, if gas prices increase significantly, this cost could exceed $60 million. A copy of the Amendment has been filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1. Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits 10.1 Fourth Amendment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2002 among Newfield Exploration Company (the "Company"), the lenders named therein (the "Banks") and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Agent (the "Agent"), to the Credit Agreement dated as of January 23, 2001 among the Company, the Banks and the Agent, as amended by the First Amendment Agreement dated as of January 31, 2001, the Second Amendment dated as of May 1, 2001, the Letter Agreement dated as of March 7, 2002 and the Third Amendment Agreement dated as of August 22, 2002.

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the Company, the Agent and the Banks agree as set forth herein. 1. Amendments to the Agreement. The Credit Agreement dated as of January 23, 2001 among the Company, the Banks and the Agent as amended by the First Amendment Agreement dated as of January 31, 2001, the Second Amendment dated as of May 1, 2001, the Letter Agreement dated as of March 7, 2002, and the Third Amendment dated as of August 22, 2002 (as amended, the "Agreement") is hereby amended as follows: 1.1 Section 1.02. Section 1.02 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following definitions in their appropriate alphabetical order: "BWT Forward Sale" shall mean the gas forward sale obligations of EEX to Bob West Treasure L.L.C. pursuant to the Natural Gas Inventory Forward Sale Contract between EEX E&P Company, L.P. and Bob West Treasure L.L.C. dated as of December 31, 1999. "Forward Sale Deduction Amount" shall mean, at any time, the greater of (i) $60,000,000 or (ii) the principal amount outstanding under the BWT Forward Sale plus the Mark to Market Hedge Exposure (the "Exposure Amount"). The Exposure Amount shall initially be $58,000,000 and shall be calculated thereafter monthly on the first day of each month beginning on January 1, 2003 (the "Calculation Date") (for each month that the Forward Sale Deduction Amount is deducted from the Calculated Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.08(g)). On each Calculation Date, the Borrower shall give written notice to the Agent by telecopy (as provided in Section 12.02) of the principal amount outstanding under the BWT Forward Sale and the Mark to Market Hedge Exposure (calculated on a monthly basis). "Fourth Amendment" shall mean the Fourth Amendment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2002, among the Company, various Banks and the Agent pertaining to this Agreement. "Mark to Market Hedge Exposure" shall mean the mark to market hedge position unwind costs for natural gas and interest rate swaps and other costs associated with the termination of the BWT Forward Sale. "May 2003 Redetermination Date" shall have the meaningp assigned to such term in Section 2.08(f). 1.2 Section 2.08. Clause (f) of Section 2.08 of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:
(f) From the date of the Third Amendment to the first Redetermination Date after August 22, 2002 (the "November 2002 Redetermination Date"), the amount of the Calculated Borrowing Base shall be $525,000,000. From the November 2002 Redetermination Date to the earlier of (i) the Acquisition Date or (ii) the first Redetermination Date after the November 2002 Redetermination Date (the "May 2002 Redetermination Date"), the amount of the Calculated Borrowing Base shall be $520,000,000. Section 2.08 is hereby further amended by adding the following clause (g) after clause (f) in such Section: (g) From the Acquisition Date to the May 2003 Redetermination Date, the Calculated Borrowing Base shall be $655,000,000, reduced dollar for dollar by the Forward Sale Deduction Amount as calculated (i) on the Acquisition Date and (ii) on the first day of each month thereafter. Each such reduction of the Calculated Borrowing Base pursuant to this Section 2.08(g) shall constitute a "redetermination" for purposes of Section 2.07(c). If the BWT Forward Sale is still in place as of the May 2003 Redetermination Date, the Required Lenders shall determine in their sole discretion at such time the effect that the amounts outstanding under the BWT Forward Sale and the Mark to Market Hedge Exposure shall have on the Calculated Borrowing Base. 1.3 Section 9.01.
