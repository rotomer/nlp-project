ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE See the following press release by Newfield Exploration Company providing an operational update and 2003 production guidance. NEWFIELD PROVIDES OPERATIONAL UPDATE AND 2003 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE Company adds additional oil and gas hedges for 2003 HOUSTON - (JANUARY 22, 2003) NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY (NYSE:NFX) today provided an update on recent operating activities. The Company also announced an expected range of production for 2003 and the addition of new oil and gas hedge positions. Since acquiring EEX Corporation in late November 2002, Newfield has increased its U.S. drilling activities. Since mid-December 2002, the Company has been operating about 20 active rigs (11 operated). Today, nine of the rigs are active in the Gulf of Mexico, seven rigs are running in South Texas and Southern Louisiana and the remaining four are active in the Mid-Continent. Newfield expects to drill 40-50 wells along the onshore Gulf Coast, 25-35 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and 40 wells in the Mid-Continent. Following approval by its board of directors in early February, Newfield will announce the amount of its 2003 capital budget. Based on current planning, Newfield expects to produce 215-225 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in 2003. This compares to 2002 estimated production of approximately 183 Bcfe. Newfield recently divested its interest in nine fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Production associated with these fields in 2003 would have been approximately 1.6 Bcfe. Significant recent drilling results by area are detailed below: THE GULF OF MEXICO: - ------------------- South Timbalier 193 A-4 - Newfield recently drilled a successful well at ST 193.
