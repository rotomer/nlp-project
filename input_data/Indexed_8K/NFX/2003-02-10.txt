Rathert Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Authorized Officer and Principal Financial Officer) 2
NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION On November 26, 2002, Newfield Exploration Company ("Newfield") acquired EEX Corporation ("EEX") pursuant to a stock-for-stock merger (the "Merger") in which Newfield Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield, merged with and into EEX, with EEX surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield. A total of approximately 7.1 million shares of Newfield common stock were issued in connection with the Merger. Newfield financed the EEX debt that became due at the closing of the Merger and a portion of the transaction costs associated with the Merger with the issuance in August 2002 of $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Notes"). The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information combines the historical consolidated balance sheets and income statements of Newfield and EEX and gives effect to the issuance of the Notes and to the Merger using the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is based on the following assumptions and adjustments: o the income statement data assume that the issuance of the Notes and the Merger were effected on January 1, 2001; o the balance sheet data assume that the issuance of the Notes and the Merger were effected on September 30, 2002; o the balance sheet and income statement data reflect Newfield's use of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay the EEX debt that became due at the closing of the Merger and to pay a portion of the transaction costs of the Merger; and o the historical financial statements of EEX have been adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of Newfield. The historical income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2001 is derived from the audited financial statements of EEX and Newfield. The historical income statement information for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002 and the historical balance sheet information as of September 30, 2002 are derived from the unaudited financial statements of EEX and Newfield. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be read together with the historical financial statements and related notes of Newfield and EEX. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the companies had always been combined or if the transactions had occurred as of the dates indicated above, nor do they purport to indicate the future results that Newfield will experience. Further, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information does not reflect the effect of restructuring charges that will be incurred to fully integrate and operate the combined organization more efficiently or anticipated synergies resulting from the Merger. The restructuring activities to integrate the companies may result in asset rationalization and other activities. F-1

NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (A) To record the reversal of historical EEX exploration expense recorded in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities.

(C) To record pro forma depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities based on the purchase price allocation to depreciable and depletable assets. (D) To record the reversal of historical EEX impairment related to oil and gas properties recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."

F-5
NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED) (M) To reflect the issuance of the Notes (net of a discount of 0.832%) and the application of the net proceeds therefrom for the repayment of EEX debt that became due at the closing of the Merger and the adjustment associated with debt issuance costs related to the Notes.

Severance costs are based on the change in control provisions in EEX's employment contracts and employee plans. All such costs are included in the preliminary purchase price allocation (see Note P). Additionally, the restructuring activities to integrate the companies may result in asset rationalization and other activities. However, no adjustments have been made to the pro forma income statements for such costs. (T) To increase historical EEX other liabilities by $0.9 million to adjust the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities to estimated fair market value. F-6

NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES The following pro forma estimated standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows shows the effect of the Merger as if it had occurred on December 31, 2001. - ------------------------------- (A) To adjust EEX historical reserves for the discontinuance of its international operations, which occurred in 2002 prior to the Merger. (B) Represents adjustments attributable to EEX's reserves based on Newfield's estimate of EEX's reserves as of December 31, 2001. Newfield's estimates vary significantly from EEX's historical estimates. (C) Includes related future development costs. Newfield's estimate of EEX's proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2001 is approximately 23% less than EEX's historical estimate. Prior to the Merger, EEX disagreed with Newfield's estimate and believed that no adjustment was required with respect to its reported estimate of proved reserves at December 31, 2001. In general, an estimate of proved reserves depends on the availability of data needed to develop the estimate and on the experience and judgment of the reservoir engineer making the estimate. Estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex. Estimates prepared by different persons may vary significantly because of the judgments made in interpreting the data. F-9
