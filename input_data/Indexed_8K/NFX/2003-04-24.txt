EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWFIELD ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE HOUSTON - (APRIL 23, 2003) - NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY (NYSE:NFX) today announced its financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2003. A conference call to discuss the results is planned for 8:30 a.m. (CDT), Thursday, April 24. To participate in the call, dial 719-457-2621. A listen-only broadcast will also be provided over the Internet. Simply go to the Investor Relations section at www.newfld.com. For the first quarter of 2003, the Company reported net income of $64.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Earnings for the quarter include the effects of the following two items: o A $10.0 million one-time charge ($6.5 million after tax), or $0.12 per share, associated with the unwind of the gas forward sales obligation inherited through the acquisition of EEX Corporation in late 2002; and o An $8.5 million gain ($5.6 million after tax), or $0.10 per share, resulting from the cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS 143. SFAS 143 changes the manner in which abandonment obligations are reported. Revenues in the first quarter of 2003 were $279.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities * was $175.9 million. This compares to net income in the first quarter of 2002 of $16.3 million, or $0.37 per share. Revenues in the first quarter of 2002 were $148.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $96.7 million in the first quarter of 2002. The Company's production in the first quarter of 2003, when stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased more than 25% over the first quarter of 2002. Newfield produced 55.2 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), or an average of 614 million cubic feet equivalent per day, during the first quarter of 2003. The following tables detail quarterly production and average realized prices.
PRODUCTION AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES ================================================================================ Prices shown are net of transportation expense and after hedging. The Company has not entered into hedging transactions specifically relating to Australian production. Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's lease operating expense (LOE) in the first quarter of 2003 was $0.58 per Mcfe. This compares to LOE of $0.53 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Higher commodity prices contributed to significantly higher production taxes in the first quarter. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2003 (including resource rent tax in Australia) increased to $0.23 per Mcfe compared to $0.08 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. DD&A expense, stated on a unit of production basis, in the first quarter of 2003 was $1.75 per Mcfe compared to $1.63 in the first quarter of 2002. The increase in DD&A expense is related primarily to higher cost reserve additions and the impact of adoption of SFAS 143. G&A expenses in the first quarter of 2003 were $0.32 per Mcfe compared to $0.28 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Capitalized G&A expenses in the first quarter of 2003 were $6.8 million compared to $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2002. The increase in G&A expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and the Company's growing workforce. In response to Newfield's increased emphasis on exploration, the Company is capitalizing a greater portion of its G&A expense. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2003 were $122.7 million. *Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:
SECOND QUARTER 2003 ESTIMATES Below are estimates of production and significant operating and financial data for the second quarter of 2003. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information at the end of this release. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING Newfield's natural gas production in the second quarter of 2003 is expected to be 42 - 47 Bcf (462 - 511 MMcf/d). The price received by the Company for its natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from the Company's Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Consolidated oil production in the second quarter of 2003 is expected to be 1.6 - 1.8 million barrels (18,000 - 20,000 BOPD). Australian oil production during the second quarter is expected to be 240 - 260 thousand barrels (2,600 - 2,900 BOPD). The timing of liftings in Australia will impact reported production and revenues. The price the Company receives for its Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Australian crude oil sales are based on the Tapis Benchmark, which has historically been comparable to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. LEASE OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES Newfield's LOE is expected to be $36 - - $39 million ($0.65 - $0.72 per Mcfe) in the second quarter of 2003. The Company's domestic LOE is expected to be $31 - $35 million ($0.59 - $0.65 per Mcfe). Production and other taxes in the second quarter of 2003 (including resource rent tax in Australia) are expected to be $10 - $11 million ($0.18 - $0.20 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE Newfield's G&A expense for the second quarter of 2003 is expected to be $14 - $16 million ($0.25 - $0.28 per Mcfe), net of capitalized G&A expense. Capitalized G&A expense is expected to be $6 - $8 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on Newfield's net income.
INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the second quarter of 2003 is expected to be $11 - $13 million ($0.21 - $0.23 per Mcfe), including a $2.3 million dividend on its convertible trust preferred securities. Current borrowings under the Company's bank facilities are $205 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of three separate issuances of senior notes that in the aggregate total $550 million principal amount. Capitalized interest for the second quarter of 2003 is expected to be about $2 - $3 million. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the second quarter of 2003 to be about 35 - 38%. About 35% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services and the availability of capital resources, labor conditions and other factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.
