NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY Date: May 20, 2003 By: /s/ TERRY W. RATHERT ------------------------ Terry W. Rathert Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 2
NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED INCOME STATEMENT On November 26, 2002, Newfield Exploration Company ("Newfield") acquired EEX Corporation ("EEX") pursuant to a stock-for-stock merger (the "Merger") in which Newfield Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield, merged with and into EEX, with EEX surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield. A total of approximately 7.1 million shares of Newfield common stock were issued in connection with the Merger. Newfield financed the EEX debt that became due at the closing of the Merger and a portion of the transaction costs associated with the Merger with the issuance in August 2002 of $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Notes"). The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement combines the historical consolidated income statements of Newfield and EEX and gives effect to the issuance of the Notes and to the Merger using the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement is based on the following assumptions and adjustments: o the income statement data assume that the issuance of the Notes and the Merger were effected on January 1, 2002; and o the historical financial statements of EEX have been adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of Newfield. The historical income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2002 is derived from the unaudited financial statements of EEX and the audited consolidated financial statements of Newfield. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement should be read together with the historical financial statements and related notes of Newfield. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement is presented for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the companies had always been combined or if the transactions had occurred as of the date indicated above, and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement does not purport to predict Newfield's future results. Further, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement does not reflect the effect of restructuring charges that have been or will be incurred to fully integrate and operate the combined organization more efficiently or synergies that have resulted, or are anticipated to result, from the Merger.
