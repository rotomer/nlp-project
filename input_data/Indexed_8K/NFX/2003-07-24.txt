EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWFIELD ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS** YEAR-TO-DATE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION CLIMBS 26% FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE HOUSTON - (JULY 23, 2003) - NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY (NYSE:NFX) today announced its financial and operating results for the second quarter and year-to-date 2003. The Company also issued estimates of certain significant operating and financial data for the third quarter of 2003. A conference call to discuss the results is planned for 8:30 a.m. (CDT), Thursday, July 24. To participate in the call, dial 719-457-2625 (conference code: 316634). A listen-only broadcast will also be provided over the Internet. Simply go to the Investor Relations section at www.newfld.com. An audio replay, as well as a transcript of the call, will be posted to the Company's website as soon as it becomes available following the call. SECOND QUARTER 2003 For the second quarter of 2003, Newfield reported net income of $45.8 million, or $0.82 per share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Two items negatively impacted results by approximately $0.21 per share for the quarter: o redemption of all of the outstanding 6 1/2% convertible trust preferred securities (QUIPS), in the second quarter, resulted in a $10.5 million charge ($6.8 million after-tax), approximately $6.5 million of which was redemption premium paid to the holders and the remainder was the write-off of unamortized issuance costs paid at the time of the initial offering of the securities in 1999; and o a ceiling test write-down of $7.3 million ($5.1 million after-tax) of producing assets offshore Australia. Based on crude oil prices in effect on June 30, 2003, the unamortized cost of the Australian properties exceeded the cost center ceiling under full cost accounting rules, requiring the ceiling test write-down at the end of the quarter. Revenues in the second quarter of 2003 were $255.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $176.3 million in the second quarter of 2003. This compares to net income in the second quarter of 2002 of $16.3 million, or $0.36 per share. Revenues in the second quarter of 2002 were $161.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $99.7 million in the second quarter of 2002. The Company's production in the second quarter of 2003, when stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased nearly 20% over the second quarter of 2002 and was up 2% over the first quarter of this year. Newfield produced 56.2 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), or an
average of 618 million cubic feet equivalent per day, during the second quarter of 2003. The following tables detail quarterly production and average realized prices. PRODUCTION AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prices shown are net of transportation expense and after hedging. The Company has not entered into hedging transactions specifically relating to Australian production. Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's lease operating expense (LOE) in the second quarter of 2003 was $0.47 per Mcfe. This compares to LOE of $0.54 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Several non-routine repairs in the Gulf of Mexico increased second quarter 2002 LOE by approximately $4 million. LOE in the second quarter of 2003 was slightly lower than expected due to the timing of expenditures on well workovers in the Gulf of Mexico, which were deferred into the third quarter of 2003. Production taxes in the second quarter of 2003 (including resource rent tax in Australia) were $0.12 per Mcfe compared to $0.08 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Higher production taxes primarily relate to significantly higher natural gas prices. DD&A expense, stated on a unit of production basis, in the second quarter of 2003 was $1.77 per Mcfe compared to $1.64 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2002. The increase in DD&A expense relates primarily to higher cost reserve additions and the impact of the adoption of SFAS 143. G&A expenses in the second quarter of 2003 were $0.28 per Mcfe compared to $0.27 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. G&A expense in the second quarter of 2003 was negatively impacted by $1.4 million in payments made to employees of EEX Corporation located in San Antonio, Texas, upon the closing of that office. G&A expense in the second quarter of 2003 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $7.4 million compared to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2002. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2003 were $106.6 million. YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 For the first six months of 2003, Newfield posted net income of $110.0 million, or $1.98 per share. Revenues for the first half of 2003 were $534.8 million. This compares to net income of $32.6 million, or $0.73 per share, on revenues of $309.7 million for the first half of 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $352.2 million in the first half of 2003 compared to $196.4 million in the same period of 2002.
Production volumes for the first half of 2003 were more than 20% above the same period last year. The Company produced 111.5 Bcfe in the first six months of 2003 compared to 91.3 Bcfe in the first six months of the prior year. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the first half of 2003: YEAR-TO-DATE PRODUCTION AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prices shown are net of transportation expense and after hedging. The Company has not entered into hedging transactions specifically relating to Australian production. In the first half of 2003, LOE, stated on a unit of production basis, averaged $0.53 per Mcfe, equal to LOE in the same period of 2002. DD&A expense in the first half of 2003 was $1.76 per Mcfe compared to $1.63 per Mcfe in the same period of the prior year. The increase in DD&A expense relates primarily to higher cost reserve additions and the impact of the adoption of SFAS 143. G&A expense in the first half of 2003 was $0.30 per Mcfe, up 7% when compared to the prior year expense of $0.28 per Mcfe. G&A expense in the first half of 2003 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $14.2 million compared to $4.2 million in the first half of 2002. Capital spending in the first half of 2003 totaled $230.7 million. *Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:
THIRD QUARTER 2003 ESTIMATES Below are estimates of production and significant operating and financial data for the third quarter of 2003. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information at the end of this release. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING Newfield's natural gas production in the third quarter of 2003 is expected to be 44 - 48 Bcf (475 - 525 MMcf/d). The price received by the Company for its natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from the Company's Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Consolidated oil production in the third quarter of 2003 is expected to be 1.8 - 2.0 million barrels (19,800 - 22,000 BOPD). Australian oil liftings during the third quarter are expected to be 342 - 378 thousand barrels (3,700 - 4,100 BOPD). The timing of liftings in Australia will impact reported production and revenues. The price the Company receives for its Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Australian crude oil sales are based on the Tapis Benchmark, which has historically been comparable to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. LEASE OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES Newfield's LOE is expected to be $40 - - $44 million ($0.69 - $0.76 per Mcfe) in the third quarter of 2003. The Company's domestic LOE is expected to be $33 - $37 million ($0.62 - $0.69 per Mcfe). Production and other taxes in the third quarter of 2003 (including resource rent tax in Australia) are expected to be $12 - $13 million ($0.20 - $0.22 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE Newfield's G&A expense for the third quarter of 2003 is expected to be $13 - $15 million ($0.23 - $0.26 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized G&A expense is expected to be $6 - $8 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on Newfield's net income. INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the third quarter of 2003 is expected to be $8 - $10 million ($0.15 - - $0.17 per Mcfe). Current borrowings under the Company's bank facilities are $140 million. The remainder of long-term
debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $550 million principal amount. Capitalized interest for the third quarter of 2003 is expected to be about $2 - $3 million. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the third quarter of 2003 to be about 35 - 38%. About 35% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
