THIRD QUARTER 2003 For the third quarter of 2003, Newfield reported net income from continuing operations of $58.4 million, or $1.04 per share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Including the loss from discontinued operations for Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd. (see "Australia Discussion"), which was sold on September 5, 2003, net income was $49.4 million, or $0.88 per share. The loss from discontinued operations was $9.0 million, or about $0.16 per share. Revenues in the third quarter of 2003 were $248.7 million. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $185.6 million in the third quarter of 2003. This compares to earnings from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2002 of $7.6 million, or $0.17 per share on revenues of $142.0 million. Including income from discontinued operations, net income was $9.4 million, or $0.21 per share for the third quarter of 2002. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in the third quarter of 2002 was $81.4 million. Newfield's total production for the third quarter of 2003, including production from its discontinued operations, was 57 Bcfe, or 619 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d). Production in the third quarter of 2003 increased nearly 30% over the same period of 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of EEX Corporation in late 2002 and the impact of production associated with drilling activity in all of the Company's U.S. focus areas. The following tables detail quarterly production and average realized prices: PRODUCTION For the three months ended September 30 2003 2002 % CHANGE ------------------------------ United States Natural gas (Bcf) 47.4 34.8 36% Oil and condensate production (MMBbls) 1.46 1.18 24% Australia -- Discontinued Operations Oil and condensate liftings (MMBbls) 0.135 0.388 (65%) Total Production (Bcfe) 57.0 44.2 29%
AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS+ 2003 2002 % CHANGE ------------------------------ United States Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 4.40 $ 3.19 38% Oil and condensate (per Bbl) $26.52 $24.84 7% Total (per Mcfe) $ 4.40 $ 3.35 31% =============================================================================== +Prices shown are net of transportation expense and after hedging. Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's lease operating expense (LOE) from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2003 was $0.55 per Mcfe, compared to $0.48 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. LOE in the third quarter of 2003 includes increased well workover activity. Production taxes from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2003 were $0.13 per Mcfe compared to $0.09 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Higher production taxes primarily are a result of significantly higher natural gas prices and more onshore production. DD&A expense from continuing operations, stated on a unit of production basis, in the third quarter of 2003 was $1.80 per Mcfe compared to $1.67 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2002. Most of the increase in DD&A expense relates to higher cost reserve additions. G&A expense from continuing operations (including stock compensation) in the third quarter of 2003 was $0.24 per Mcfe compared to $0.32 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. G&A expense in the third quarter of 2003 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $6.2 million compared to $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2002. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2003 were $251.6 million. AUSTRALIA DISCUSSION During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which owned all of Newfield's properties in Australia. Newfield purchased the stock and working capital of the Australian business for $27 million in mid-1999. During Newfield's ownership, the Company received proceeds from dividends and the sale of the business totaling $46 million. In addition to making a good return, the venture provided the Company with exposure to high-risk, high-potential exploration wells and allowed Newfield to learn about remote international operations and the operation of floating production storage and offloading vessels, or FPSOs. As a result of the sale in the third quarter of 2003, Newfield recognized a loss of $9.9 million, or about $0.18 per share. Australia is now considered a "discontinued operation" for reporting purposes. In addition to the loss described above, the loss from discontinued operations during the first nine months of 2003 also included a second quarter 2003 ceiling test writedown of producing assets in Australia of $7.3 million ($5.1 million after-tax). YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 For the first nine months of 2003, Newfield reported net income from continuing operations of $170.8 million, or $3.06 per share, on revenues of $772.1 million. The following items negatively impacted earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.23 per share during the first nine months of 2003: o a $10.0 million one-time charge in the first quarter ($6.5 million after-tax), or $0.11 per share, associated with the unwind of the gas forward sales obligation inherited through the acquisition of EEX in late 2002; and o the redemption of all of the outstanding 6 1/2% convertible trust preferred securities (QUIPS), in the second quarter resulted in a $10.5 million charge ($6.8 million after-tax), approximately $6.5 million of which was redemption premium paid to the holders and the remainder was the write-off of unamortized issuance costs paid at the time of the initial offering of the securities in 1999.
Including the loss from discontinued operations and a cumulative effect adjustment for the adoption of SFAS 143, net income was $159.3 million, or $2.86 per share, for the first nine months of 2003. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $538.9 million. For the first nine months of 2002, Newfield reported net income from continuing operations of $39.9 million, or $0.89 per share, on revenues of $437.9 million. Including discontinued operations, net income was $42.0 million, or $0.93 per share, for the first nine months of 2002. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities* was $272.3 million in the first nine months of 2002. Newfield's production, including production from discontinued operations, for the first nine months of 2003 was about 25% above the same period last year. The Company produced 168.4 Bcfe in the first nine months of 2003 compared to 135.5 Bcfe in the same period of the prior year. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the first nine months of 2003 and 2002: PRODUCTION For the Nine Months Ended September 30 2003 2002 % CHANGE ------------------------------ United States Natural gas (Bcf) 138.1 106.5 30% Oil and condensate production (MMBbls) 4.56 3.86 18% Australia -- Discontinued Operations Oil and condensate liftings (MMBbls) 0.492 0.964 (49%) Total Production (Bcfe) 168.4 135.5 24% AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS+ 2003 2002 % CHANGE ------------------------------ United States Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 4.64 $ 3.22 44% Oil and condensate (per Bbl) $27.71 $23.52 18% TOTAL (PER MCFE) $ 4.64 $ 3.34 39% =============================================================================== +Prices shown are net of transportation expense and after hedging. For the first nine months of 2003, LOE from continuing operations averaged $0.52 per Mcfe, as compared to $0.49 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Production taxes from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2003 were $0.15 per Mcfe compared to $0.08 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. Higher production taxes primarily are the result of significantly higher commodity prices and more onshore production. DD&A expense from continuing operations in the first three quarters of 2003 increased to $1.77 per Mcfe from $1.66 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2002. The increase in DD&A expense relates primarily to higher cost reserve additions. Year-to-date, G&A expense from continuing operations (including stock compensation) averaged $0.28 per Mcfe compared to $0.30 per Mcfe in the same period of last year. G&A expense in the first nine months of 2003 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $20.4 million compared to $6.4 million in the same period of 2002. Capital expenditures through the end of the third quarter were $482.4 million. For the full-year 2003, Newfield expects to invest about $640 million, including capitalized interest and overhead. Included in the $640 million estimate is about $150 million of acquisitions that have been closed year-to-date. Newfield estimates that net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 will exceed $700 million.
Tables with third quarter and year-to-date 2003 and comparative 2002 financial information follow this release. *Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is shown below: 3Q03 3Q02 ------------------------- Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 191.1 $ 87.0 LESS: (Increase) decrease in operating assets and liabilities 5.5 5.6 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities $ 185.6 $ 81.4 YTD03 YTD02 ------------------------- Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 467.9 $ 276.9 LESS: (Increase) decrease in operating assets and liabilities (71.0) 4.6 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities $ 538.9 $ 272.3 FOURTH QUARTER 2003 ESTIMATES Below are estimates of production and significant operating and financial data for the fourth quarter of 2003. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information at the end of this release. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING Newfield's natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be 43 - 47 Bcf (468 - 518 MMcf/d). The price received by the Company for its natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from the Company's Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Oil production in the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be 1.3 - 1.5 million barrels (15,000 - 16,000 BOPD). The price the Company receives for its Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. LEASE OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES Newfield's LOE is expected to be $29 - - $32 million ($0.54 - $0.59 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter of 2003. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2003 are expected to be $9 - $10 million ($0.16 - $0.18 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE Newfield's G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be $13 - $15 million ($0.25 - $0.28 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized G&A expense is expected to be $6 - $8 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on Newfield's net income. INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be $8 - $9 million ($0.15 - - $0.16 per Mcfe). Current borrowings under the Company's bank facilities are $140 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $550 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be about $3 - $4 million. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2003 to be about 35 - 38%. About 50% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

EXHIBIT 99.2 NEWFIELD PROVIDES EARLY GUIDANCE FOR 2004 PRODUCTION VOLUMES** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE HOUSTON - (OCTOBER 30, 2003) - In today's third quarter 2003 financial and operating results conference call, NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY (NYSE:NFX) disclosed the following regarding 2004 production estimates: David A. Trice, Newfield President and CEO, said "Our production this year has been strong and we will once again make our target in 2003. We think that the consistency of our performance and track record sets us apart from our peers and competitors. We are in the planning process for 2004 at this time and will publish specific 2004 guidance in February 2004. Our current outlook calls for 2-5% organic growth in 2004. With some significant wells coming on line in the fourth quarter of 2003, and increased drilling activity in our onshore areas, we expect our gas production to exit 2003 at about 525 million cubic feet per day and oil production to end the year at about 16,000 barrels of oil per day, reflecting the sale of Australia." Trice also stated that year-to-date 2003, Newfield has replaced its production with the addition of new reserves in all domestic focus areas.
