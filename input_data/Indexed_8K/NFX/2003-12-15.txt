ITEM 11. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF TRADING UNDER REGISTRANT'S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Among other restrictions, the insider trading policy of Newfield Exploration Company ("Newfield") generally prohibits all directors, officers and employees of Newfield and its subsidiaries from trading in Newfield's securities during the period beginning on the first day of each calendar quarter and ending at the close of trading on the second trading day following the release of Newfield's earnings announcement for that quarter. During this period participants in Newfield's 401(k) plan are prohibited from changing the percentage of future contributions to be invested in the Newfield common stock investment option under the plan and from transferring or reallocating prior contributions from or to the Newfield common stock investment option.

Newfield currently expects to release its quarterly earnings announcement during the week of February 9, 2004. Inquiries about the blackout period may be directed to C.
