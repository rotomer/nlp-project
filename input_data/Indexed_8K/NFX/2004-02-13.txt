EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWFIELD REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2003 RESULTS** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE HOUSTON - (FEBRUARY 11, 2004) -- NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY (NYSE:NFX) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2003. A 2004 capital budget of $600 million (excluding acquisitions) also was announced, as well as financial and operational guidance for the first quarter of 2004. The Company will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. CST on Thursday, February 12, 2004. To participate in the call, please visit the Company's web site at www.newfld.com. HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE: o Increased 2003 production volumes 21%. Production growth due to a combination of acquisitions and drilling success. o Replaced 163% of 2003 production with the addition of 359 Bcfe of new reserves. Approximately 108% of 2003 production was replaced through discoveries and extensions. Reserves increased to 1.32 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe). Asset diversification continued, with about 59% of the Company's total reserves now located onshore and 41% in the Gulf of Mexico. o Drilled 200 total wells within a risk/reward-balanced portfolio. Drilled a record 69 wells in the Onshore Gulf Coast region and 95 wells in the Mid-Continent. o Announced the Company's first deepwater discovery in the Gulf of Mexico with the Rigel Field and signed a joint venture agreement to develop the deepwater Glider Field. o Gained momentum in international program. Acquired first assets in UK North Sea and was awarded license area in Southern Gas Basin. In China's Bohai Bay, successful appraisal drilling was conducted in two oil fields. Newfield believes the fields are commercial and is working on the required development plan filings with the Chinese government. o Announced 2004 capital budget of $600 million. The program includes a record $230 million for exploration. Drilling plans include 25-35 wells in the Gulf of Mexico (including 6-8 deep shelf wells and 3-4 in deepwater), 45-70 wells onshore Gulf Coast, a record 160 wells in the Mid-Continent and 4-6 wells internationally. Newfield President and CEO David A. Trice said, "We made great strides in 2003 as we continued to diversify our asset base and execute our strategy. We once again replaced our production with the addition of new reserves. Importantly, our prospecting and drilling efforts in 2003 set up a solid inventory of prospects for 2004. Our 2004 drilling inventory offers more
reserve exposure than we have ever had at Newfield. Our exploration efforts have grown and we will invest a record amount to test impact prospects along the Gulf Coast, in deepwater, in the deep shelf and internationally. We enter 2004 with financial strength underpinned by an attractive hedging position and a portfolio that is expected to provide another year of growth in reserves and production." FOURTH QUARTER 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS For the fourth quarter of 2003, Newfield reported net income from continuing operations of $40.2 million, or $0.71 per share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Stated without the effect of a $6.8 million ($4.4 million after-tax), or $0.08 per share, charge related to unrealized commodity derivative transactions (SFAS 133), net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $44.6 million, or $0.79 per share. Earnings in the quarter were negatively impacted by an adjustment to the Company's accrual for estimated deferred income tax expense. As a result, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 44%. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $245 million. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $195.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. See Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This compares to net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $28.8 million, or $0.59 per share. Stated without the effect of a $3.7 million ($2.4 million after-tax), or $0.04 per share, charge related to unrealized commodity derivative transactions (SFAS 133), net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $31.2 million, or $0.63 per share. Including income from discontinued operations, net income in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $31.9 million, or $0.65 per share. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $189 million. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $125.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. See Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. FOURTH QUARTER 2003 PRODUCTION Newfield's production in the fourth quarter of 2003 was 55.1 Bcfe, a 13% increase over fourth quarter 2002 production of 48.6 Bcfe, which includes production from discontinued operations of 2.3 Bcfe. The following tables detail production and average realized prices from continuing operations for the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002. FOURTH QUARTER AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES+ - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- +Prices shown are net of all applicable transportation expenses, which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.02 per Mcf for the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002. The realized price of oil and condensate was reduced by $0.27 and $0.32 per barrel for the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively. Average realized prices include the effects of hedging.
Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's lease operating expense (LOE) in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $0.61 per Mcfe, slightly higher than LOE from continuing operations of $0.59 in the same period of 2002. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased to $0.12 per Mcfe compared to production taxes from continuing operations of $0.05 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. DD&A expense, stated on a unit of production basis, in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $1.84 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense from continuing operations of $1.71 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2002. G&A expense (including stock compensation) in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $0.28 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense from continuing operations of $0.36 per Mcfe in the same period of 2002. G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $6.3 million compared to $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $165.6 million. FULL-YEAR 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS For 2003, Newfield reported net income from continuing operations of $210.9 million, or $3.77 per share, on revenues of $1.0 billion. The following items negatively impacted earnings from continuing operations during 2003: o a $10.0 million one-time charge was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 ($6.5 million after-tax), in connection with the unwind of the gas forward sales obligation inherited through the acquisition of EEX in late 2002; and o the redemption of all outstanding 6 1/2% convertible trust preferred securities (QUIPS), in the second quarter of 2003 resulted in a $10.5 million charge ($6.8 million after-tax), approximately $6.5 million of which was redemption premium paid to the holders and the remainder was the write-off of unamortized issuance costs paid at the time of the initial offering of the securities in 1999. Including the loss from discontinued operations (see Discontinued Operations discussion below) and the gain from the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS 143, net income was $199.5 million, or $3.57 per share for 2003. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 was $734.3 million. See Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. For 2002, Newfield reported net income from continuing operations of $68.7 million, or $1.51 per share, on revenues of $626.8 million. Including income from discontinued operations, net income was $73.8 million, or $1.61 per share, for 2002. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2002 was $397.5 million. See Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 2003 PRODUCTION Newfield's production for 2003, including production from discontinued operations, was 21% above 2002 levels. Including production from discontinued operations the Company produced 223.5 Bcfe in 2003 compared to 184.1 Bcfe in 2002. The following tables detail production and average realized prices from continuing operations for 2003 and 2002:
2003 AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES+ - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- +Prices shown are net of all applicable transportation expenses, which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.02 per Mcf and $0.03 per Mcf for the years ended 2003 and 2002, respectively. The realized price of oil and condensate was reduced by $0.34 and $0.35 per barrel for the years ended 2003 and 2002, respectively. Average realized prices include the effects of hedging. Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's LOE from continuing operations in 2003 was $0.54 per Mcfe compared to 2002 LOE of $0.52 per Mcfe. Production taxes from continuing operations in 2003 increased to $0.14 per Mcfe compared to $0.08 per Mcfe in 2002. DD&A expense from continuing operations in 2003, stated on a unit of production basis, was $1.79 per Mcfe compared to $1.68 per Mcfe in 2002. G&A expense from continuing operations (including stock compensation) in 2003 was $0.28 per Mcfe compared to $0.31 per Mcfe in 2002. G&A expense in 2003 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $26.7 million compared to $7.0 million in 2002. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which owned all of Newfield's properties in Australia. As a result of the sale, Newfield recognized an after-tax loss of $9.9 million, or about $0.18 per share. In addition to this loss, the loss from discontinued operations also included a second quarter 2003 ceiling test writedown of producing assets of $7.3 million ($5.1 million after-tax). FINDING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS United States: Newfield added 356 Bcfe with its core domestic program (excluding property sales of 3 Bcfe), replacing 161% of 2003 production. Total domestic investment in 2003 was $631 million, including acquisitions. Approximately $66 million was spent on seismic data and leasehold acquisition. International: Newfield invested $16 million in international operations in 2003. Approximately $9 million was invested in North Sea activities and approximately $5 million was spent on the appraisal of two oil fields in China's Bohai Bay. RESERVE REPLACEMENT AND PROVED RESERVES During 2003, Newfield's worldwide reserve replacement was 163% of production from continuing operations of 220.6 Bcfe. The Company's reserve replacement in 2002 was 255% of total production. 2003 marks the 14th consecutive year that Newfield has more than replaced annual production with proved reserves. At the end of 2003, Newfield had proved reserves of 1.32 Tcfe, which is net of the impact of property sales of approximately 24 Bcfe (21 Bcfe of which relates to discontinued operations in Australia). Proved reserves at year-end 2003 increased 9% over 2002 proved reserves of 1.21 Tcfe. At year-end 2003, Newfield's reserves were 83% natural gas compared to 81% natural gas
at year-end 2002. Only 13% of Newfield's proved reserves are "proved undeveloped," among the lowest percentage in the industry. EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Earnings stated without the effect of unrealized commodity derivative transactions (SFAS 133), a non-GAAP financial measure, exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because the timing and amount of these items cannot be reasonably estimated and because earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is shown below: 2004 PLANNED CAPITAL SPENDING Newfield announced a 2004 capital budget of $600 million, excluding acquisitions. A record $230 million is being allocated to exploration. Development spending is expected to be about $315 million. 2004 ESTIMATES Below are production estimates for the full-year 2004 and estimates for significant operating and financial data for the first quarter of 2004. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information at the end of this release.
2004 PRODUCTION As previously announced, Newfield expects its 2004 production to be in the range of 225 - 235 Bcfe, an increase of 2 - 5% over 2003 production of 220.6 Bcfe. About 50% of the Company's production in 2004 is expected to come from the Gulf of Mexico. About 30-35% of total production in 2004 is expected to come from the onshore Gulf Coast region. The Mid-Continent region accounts for 15-20% of expected 2004 production. FIRST QUARTER 2004 ESTIMATES NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING The Company's natural gas production in the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be 44 - 48 Bcf (480 - 530 MMcf/d). The price the Company receives for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Oil production in the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be 1.3 - 1.5 million barrels (14,800 - 16,500 BOPD). The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. LEASE OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES LOE is expected to be $31 - $35 million ($0.60 - $0.66 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2004. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2004 are expected to be $10 - $11 million ($0.20 - $0.22 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE G&A expense for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be $15 - $17 million ($0.28 - $0.30 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized G&A expense is expected to be $6 - - $8 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on net income. INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be $5 - $6 million ($0.09 - $0.10 per Mcfe). Current borrowings under the Company's bank facilities are $85 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $550 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be about $6 - $7 million. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, Newfield expects its consolidated income tax rate in the first quarter of 2004 to be about 35 - 38%. About 45% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred. The Company provides information regarding its outstanding hedging positions in its annual report and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and in its electronic publication -- @NFX. This publication can be found on Newfield's web page at http://www.newfld.com. Through the web page, you may elect to receive @NFX through e-mail distribution. Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. We rely on a proven growth strategy that includes balancing acquisitions with drill bit opportunities. Our areas of operation include the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore U.S. Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins and select international ventures.
**Certain of the statements set forth in this release regarding planned capital expenditures, drilling plans, the commerciality and development of discoveries in China and estimated or anticipated full year 2004 production volumes and first quarter results and production volumes are forward-looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources, labor conditions and other factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.

It may include estimates of expected production volumes, costs and expenses, recent changes to hedging positions and commodity pricing. If you have problems viewing this e-mail please go to www.newfld.com February 11, 2004 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This edition of @NFX includes: o Update on drilling activities during the fourth quarter and full-year 2003; o Guidance for the first quarter of 2004; and o Updated tables detailing complete hedging positions - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 was a record year - financially and operationally. We drilled 200 wells in 2003 compared to 83 wells in 2002. Our overall success rate was 85%. The Mid-Continent was the most active region in terms of well counts. We drilled 95 wells in the Mid-Continent in 2003 compared to just 40 in 2002. We drilled 69 wells in the Onshore Gulf Coast in 2003 - 57 were successful. About 50 of those wells were on the acreage we acquired in the EEX transaction. We remained one of the most active companies in the Gulf of Mexico, drilling 33 wells. Two of the wells were in deepwater. We plan to drill 15-20 wells in the traditional Gulf, 6-8 deep shelf wells and 3-4 wells in deepwater. Along the onshore Gulf Coast, we'll drill 30-50 development wells and 15-20 exploration wells. In the Mid-Continent, we expect to drill 150-160 wells. We also expect to drill 4-6 wells internationally, including our first test in the North Sea in the second half of this year. We expect to commence a development plan on our two field discoveries in Bohai Bay that will lead to '06 oil production. We announced a 2004 capital budget of $600 MM. Based on our drilling inventory, we plan to spend $230 million on exploration - topping our $200 MM exploration budget in 2003. We have development projects that will require about $315 million of investments and we budgeted increased international spending of about $60 million in 2004. ONSHORE GULF COAST During the fourth quarter of 2003, we operated the drilling of 14 wells in Texas and Louisiana... 12 of which were successful. For the full year 2003, we drilled 69 wells onshore Texas and Louisiana, of which 57 were successful. WALT DEEP We made a new field discovery in the fourth quarter with the drilling of our Walt Deep Prospect, located near Provident City in Lavaca County, Texas. The well found 150' of net gas pay and testing is underway. We operate the development of Walt Deep with a 100% working interest.
WEST CANEY CREEK FIELD We continued to drill development wells in our West Caney Creek Field, located in Wharton County, Texas. During the fourth quarter, we drilled our best well in the field to date - the Peach Creek G.U. #5. The well is now on line at more than 18 MMcfe/d. The Davis Locke #2 well is drilling. We've drilled eight successful wells in this field to date and have 5-7 locations remaining. We operate the West Caney Creek Field and our working interest ranges from 58-77%. SOUTHWEST JONES CREEK Southwest of the West Caney Creek Field, the Pryor #1 wildcat well was a recent success, discovering a new field we call Southwest Jones Creek. A flow line is currently being hooked to the well and first production is expected later this month. We operate the new development with a 50% working interest. DESTINO DEEP During the fourth quarter, we drilled a successful development well offsetting our Destino Deep discovery well. The Carillo Conoco Fee #1 sidetrack well found pay in two objectives and was completed. We have a 68% working interest in the well. The Destino Deep discovery well tested 26 MMcf/d. We have a 79% working interest in this initial well. We are building production facilities now and expect to have the field on line late in the first quarter. LA RUCIA RANCH The La Rucia Ranch #16 well, located in Hidalgo County, Texas, was successful and found 100' of net gas pay. The well is on-line at 7 MMcf/d and 280 BCPD. We are the operator and have a 67% working interest. Success at La Rucia Ranch #16 sets up 3-5 additional development wells that we plan to drill in 2004. VAL VERDE BASIN The Val Verde Basin of southwest Texas was our most active drilling area in the onshore Gulf Coast division in 2003. We drilled 20 successful wells out of 22 attempts and now hold more than 100,000 gross lease acres in the area. More than 15,000 gross acres were added in 2003. Gross daily production in the trend is about 30 MMcfe/d. We expect to drill at least 20 development wells and 5 exploration wells in the area in 2004. EAST VINEGARONE FIELD Our most significant development project in the Val Verde Basin is the East Vinegarone Field, located in Edwards County. We control about 10,000 gross acres in the field and leased 3,700 acres in 2003. We drilled 14 development wells in 2003 and increased field production to over 22 MMcfe/d. We expect to drill additional exploration and development wells in the field in 2004. We own a 100% working interest in this field. EAST TEXAS We remained active in East Texas, a new focus area gained through the acquisition of EEX in late 2002. Development drilling is underway in three fields - Oak Hill, Woodlawn and Carthage - where we drilled 13 successful wells in 2003. We operate the fields with working interests ranging from 98-100%. Development drilling in the Carthage Field began in the fourth quarter. Most recently, the Adams 1-3 well was successful finding 190' of pay and the Adams 1-4 is currently drilling.
GALVESTON BAY During 2003, we drilled two successful wells in Galveston Bay. We also drilled a successful replacement well at State Tract 65 in a field that had been offline due to mechanical reasons. The recently tested Goldfish Prospect was a dry hole. We operated the well with a 62% interest. SOUTHERN LOUISIANA We are currently drilling two deep exploration tests in Southern Louisiana. Lake Hatch, located in Terrebonne Parish, is expected to be down in the next several weeks. The second test currently drilling is Moose. Moose has a planned total depth of 23,500'. We have a 25% interest in this outside operated well. The Canvasback Prospect, located in St. Martin Parish, was a dry hole. GULF OF MEXICO In the Gulf of Mexico, we drilled six wells in the fourth quarter including one dry hole. For the year, we drilled 33 wells in the Gulf of Mexico (2 in deepwater), including 12 dry holes. Five rigs are currently drilling. EUGENE ISLAND 143 Development drilling around a 2002 deep shelf discovery continued in the fourth quarter. We now have three wells on line in the field. The field is currently producing 25 MMcfe/d and we have a 50% working interest. SHIP SHOAL 69 #6 ST The well was drilled to 12,100' and logged pay in four sands. The well was drilled from an existing platform and is now on line at 5 MMcfe/d. We operated the well with a 75% working interest. SOUTH TIMBALIER 148 We drilled two successful wells at South Timbalier 148. Our B-1 ST found 60' of net gas pay and is now on line at 5 MMcf/d. We have an 83% working interest in this well. We followed with the drilling of the South Timbalier 148 D-4 ST well and found more than 100' of net gas pay. The well is expected to be on line in late February at 5 MMcf/d. We operated the well with a 56% working interest. SOUTH PASS 11 We drilled a successful development well with the #193. The well is now on line at 16.5 MMcf/d and 425 BCPD. We own a 33% working interest in the well. We drilled one dry hole during the quarter at High Island 207 with the #5 exploration well. MID-CONTINENT We drilled 95 wells in the Mid-Continent in 2003 (with only three dry holes) and expect to drill 150-160 wells in 2004. This compares to the drilling of just 40 wells in 2002. We are currently operating 12 rigs and participating in three outside operated wells. We expect to maintain 12-13 rigs for the near future. Activity is primarily related to our "gas mining" play. Below are some recent highlights.
GRAND AREA We are now running three rigs in the Grand area, located in Ellis County, Oklahoma. We expect to maintain a three-rig program through much of 2004. Current production is 13 MMcfe/d. We have a 100% working interest in the field. We added more than 22,000 net acres of new leasehold in the area in 2003 and now have about 30,000 net acres to develop. STILES RANCH/BUFFALO WALLOW We are running three operated rigs in the Texas Panhandle. Our interests in these areas came primarily through two acquisitions: EEX in 2002 put us in the Stiles Ranch Field; and Primary Natural Resources in late 2003 put us in the Buffalo Wallow area. Our three-rig program is expected to continue throughout 2004. Current production is about 11 MMcfe/d and we have a 100% working interest in both fields. CROMWELL PLAY Located in Pittsburg County, we drilled 20 wells in the Cromwell play area in 2003 and continue to run a three-rig program today. Since January 1, 2004, we've drilled 4 operated wells and production from the Cromwell play is now up to 13 MMcfe/d. We expect to drill over 50 wells in this area during 2004. During 2003 we acquired 24,000 net acres and now have over 40,000 net acres in the Cromwell Area. BIG 4 We have two rigs drilling in the Big 4 play, located in Central Oklahoma. Operations in this area kicked off in the second half of last year and we now expect to drill about 20 wells in 2004. 2004 Estimates Below are production estimates for the full-year 2004 and estimates for significant operating and financial data for the first quarter of 2004. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, such expectations are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking information at the end of this publication. 2004 PRODUCTION As previously announced, Newfield expects its 2004 production to be in the range of 225 - 235 Bcfe, an increase of 2 - 5% over 2003 production of 220.6 Bcfe. About 50% of the Company's production in 2004 is expected to come from the Gulf of Mexico. About 30-35% of total production in 2004 is expected to come from the onshore Gulf Coast region. The Mid-Continent region accounts for 15-20% of expected 2004 production. First Quarter 2004 Estimates NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PRICING The Company's natural gas production in the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be 44 - 48 Bcf (480 - 530 MMcf/d). The price the Company receives for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast has typically tracked the Henry Hub Index. Gas from Mid-Continent properties has typically sold at a discount of $0.12 - $0.15 per Mcfe to Henry Hub. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AND PRICING Oil production in the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be 1.3 - 1.5 million barrels (14,800 - 16,500 BOPD). The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production has typically averaged about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent has typically sold at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations. LEASE OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES LOE is expected to be $31 - $35 million ($0.60 - $0.66 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2004. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2004 are expected to be $10 - $11 million ($0.20 - $0.22 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE G&A expense for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be $15 - $17 million ($0.28 - $0.30 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized G&A expense is expected to be $6 - $8 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on net income. INTEREST EXPENSE The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be $5 - $6 million ($0.09 - $0.10 per Mcfe). Current borrowings under the Company's bank facilities are $85 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $550 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be about $6 - $7 million. INCOME TAXES Including both current and deferred taxes, Newfield expects its consolidated income tax rate in the first quarter of 2004 to be about 35 - 38%. About 45% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please see the tables below for our complete hedging positions. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NATURAL GAS HEDGE POSITIONS The following hedge positions for the first quarter of 2004 and beyond are as of February 10, 2004: First Quarter 2004 - ------------------
