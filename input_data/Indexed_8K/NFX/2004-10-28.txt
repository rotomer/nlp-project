Third Quarter 2004
     For the third quarter of 2004, Newfield reported net income of $81.6 million, or $1.35 per share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Stated without the effect of $9.7 million ($6.3 million after-tax), or $0.10 per share, of net gain related to unrealized commodity derivative transactions, net income for the third quarter was $75.3 million, or $1.25 per share. Revenues in the third quarter of 2004 were $327.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $267.7 million in the third quarter of 2004. See .
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     Newfield's results for the third quarter of 2004 compare favorably to the same period of the prior year. Net income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2003 was $58.4 million, or $1.04 per share. Stated without the effect of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax), or $0.04 per share, of net gain related to unrealized commodity derivative transactions, net income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $56.1 million, or $1.00 per share. The loss from discontinued operations was $9.0 million, or $0.16 per share. Revenues in the third quarter of 2003 were $248.7 million. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $185.6 million in the third quarter of 2003.
     Newfield's production in the third quarter of 2004 was 60.7 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), an 8% increase over production of 56.1 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2003. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the third quarter of 2004 and 2003.

+Prices shown are net of all applicable transportation expenses, which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.02 per Mcf for both periods and the realized price of oil and condensate by $0.28 and $0.32 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Average realized prices also include the effects of hedging other than our three-way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Had we included the realized loss on our three-way collar contracts, our average realized price for natural gas would have been $5.03 per Mcf and our average realized price for oil and condensate would have been $36.20 per Bbl for the third quarter of 2004. No three-way contracts were settled in the third quarter of 2003.
     Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's lease operating expense (LOE) in the third quarter of 2004 was $0.66 per Mcfe compared to LOE from continuing operations of $0.55 per Mcfe in the same period of 2003. Production taxes in the third quarter of 2004 increased to $0.21 per Mcfe compared to production taxes from continuing operations of $0.13 per Mcfe in the same period of 2003. DD&A expense in the third quarter of 2004 was $1.95 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense from continuing operations of $1.80 per Mcfe in the same period of 2003. The increase in DD&A expense is due primarily to the third quarter acquisition of Denbury's Gulf of Mexico properties. G&A expense (including stock compensation) in the third
 
quarter of 2004 was $0.36 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense from continuing operations of $0.25 in the same period of 2003. G&A expense in the third quarter of 2004 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $9.1 million. Capitalized direct internal costs were $6.2 million in the third quarter of 2003.
     Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2004 were $1.2 billion, including $719 million allocated for financial accounting purposes to the oil and gas properties acquired in the $575 million purchase of Inland Resources, Inc. Capital expenditures for the quarter also include the recognition of asset retirement costs of $44 million associated with our recent acquisitions.
Year-to-Date 2004
     For the first nine months of 2004, Newfield posted net income of $226.9 million, or $3.91 per share. Revenues for the first nine months of 2004 were $915.8 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $170.8 million, or $3.06 per share, on revenues of $772.1 million for the first nine months of 2003. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $660.9 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared to $538.9 million in the same period of 2003. See .
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     Production volumes for the first nine months of 2004 increased 5% over the same period last year. The Company produced 174.1 Bcfe in the first nine months of 2004 compared to production from continuing operations of 165.5 Bcfe in the first nine months of the prior year. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the first nine months of 2004 and 2003:

Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than our three-way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Had we included the realized loss on our three-way contracts our average realized price for natural gas would have been $5.05 per Mcf and our average realized price for oil and condensate would have been $33.27 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. No three-way contracts were settled in the first nine months of 2003.
     In the first nine months of 2004, LOE, stated on a unit of production basis, averaged $0.57 per Mcfe, compared to LOE from continuing operations of $0.52 per Mcfe in the same period of 2003. Production taxes in the first nine months of 2004 were $0.17 per Mcfe compared to production taxes from continuing operations of $0.15 per Mcfe in the same period of 2003. DD&A expense in the first nine months of 2004 was $1.89 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense from continuing operations of $1.77 per Mcfe in the same period of 2003. G&A expense (including stock compensation) in the first nine months of 2004 was $0.34 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense from continuing operations of $0.28 per Mcfe in the prior year. G&A expense in the first nine months of 2004 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $25.1 million. Capitalized direct internal costs were $20.4 million in the first nine months of 2003.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     Earnings stated without the effect of unrealized commodity derivative transactions, a non-GAAP financial measure, exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because the amount of these items cannot be reasonably estimated and because earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts. Commodity derivative income as stated in our consolidated statement of income for the third quarter of 2004 includes an unrealized increase in the fair value of our three-way collar contracts of $9.2 million, a realized loss of $8.3 million for our three-way collar contracts and a decrease in hedge ineffectiveness of $0.5 million associated with our cash flow hedges. Commodity derivative income as stated in our consolidated statement of income for the third quarter of 2003 includes only changes in hedge ineffectiveness associated with our cash flow hedges. A reconciliation of earnings stated without the effect of the unrealized commodity derivative transactions to net income is shown below:
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is shown below:
2005 Production Estimate
     The Company expects to produce 255  270 Bcfe in 2005, an increase of 6 - 12% over 2004 estimated production of about 240 Bcfe. Preliminary capital spending for 2005 is estimated at about $850  900 million. A final budget is being prepared and will be submitted to the Company's board of directors for approval in February 2005.
Fourth Quarter 2004 Estimates
     The Company's natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be 49  54 Bcf (533  590 MMcf/d). The price the Company realizes for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast on an Mcf basis after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically averages $0.15  $0.20 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for our Mid-Continent properties after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges typically average $0.70  $0.80 per MMBtu less than Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
 
     Oil production in the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be 2.4  2.6 million barrels (25,700  28,400 BOPD). These estimates include approximately 4,300 BOPD from the Company's Malaysian operations. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $3 below WTI price. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00  $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
     LOE is expected to be $45  $50 million ($0.67  $0.75 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter of 2004. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004 are expected to be $14  $15 million ($0.21 - - $0.24 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
Lease Operating and Other Expenses
     G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be $20  $22 million ($0.31  $0.34 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized G&A expense is expected to be $8 - - $9 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on net income.
General and Administrative Expense
     The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be $13  $14 million ($0.10  $0.11 per Mcfe). As of October 27, 2004, borrowings under the Company's credit arrangements were $182 million. The remainder of long-term debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $875 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be about $3  $5 million.
Interest Expense
     Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2004 to be about 35  39%. About 60% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
Income Taxes

October 27, 2004
This edition of @NFX includes:
Onshore Gulf Coast
During the third quarter, we drilled 20 successful wells out of 22 total wells in Texas and Louisiana. We operated 16 of the wells drilled during the quarter. We are currently operating 12 rigs (including workovers and recompletes) and are participating in two outside operated wells onshore Texas.
Val Verde Basin
Exploration success continued in the Val Verde Basin of southwest Texas, where we made a potentially significant discovery with our Whitehead 73-01 prospect. The well was drilled and completed for less than $1 million and is now on-line. We are planning to drill two offset wells over the next six months to determine aerial extent. We have a 100% interest in this new discovery.
An appraisal well was drilled on our Packenham discovery, which was announced in the second quarter. The Poulter 38-01 is now being tested. We plan to drill two to three additional appraisal wells in the field. We have a 60% operated interest in the Packenham development and an interest in more than 3,500 acres in the area.
The Val Verde Basin is one of our most active onshore Gulf Coast drilling areas in 2004. We hold more than 100,000 lease acres in the basin where we are working three geologic trends.
West Caney Creek Field
We continued our development program in the West Caney Creek Field, located in Wharton County, Texas. We drilled the Peach Creek Gas Unit #10 and found about 200' of net gas pay in three sands. However, the casing collapsed and we were unable to complete the well. Prior to these mechanical problems, the well tested at 12 MMcfe/d. We are in the process of re-drilling the well. Once on-line, the #10 re-drill well is expected to add about 10 MMcfe/d. The Corbett G.U. #1 well, an offset to the Davis Locke #2, was a dry hole. We've drilled 12 successful wells in the field and proposals have been sent to partners to drill the Peach Creek G.U. #8 and the Peach Creek G.U. #11. Current field production is about 35 MMcfe/d (gross). We operate with working interests ranging from 58-77%.
 
La Reforma Field
We have drilled four successful wells in the La Reforma Field since acquiring in the EEX transaction in late 2002. The field is located in Hidalgo County, Texas. During the second quarter, we successfully drilled the Guerra D-1 well, which came on line at 10 MMcfe/d. Total field production is about 16 MMcfe/d gross. We are planning to drill an offset well to the Guerra D-1 later this year. Our C-3 exploration well is currently drilling. Newfield operates the field with a 50% working interest.
La Rucia Ranch Field
Development drilling continues in the La Rucia Ranch Field, located in Hidalgo County, Texas. During the third quarter, the La Rucia Ranch #20 was successfully drilled and tested 6 MMcfe/d. The La Rucia Ranch #21 well recently reached TD and is now completing. We are currently drilling the La Rucia Ranch #22 well and have plans to drill at least two additional development wells in the field. We operate the field with a 67% working interest.
Dinn Ranch Field
We successfully drilled the Buck Hamilton #10 development well in the Dinn Ranch Field, located in Duvall County, Texas. The Buck Hamilton #10 well is on line at 21.7 MMcfe/d. Current gross field production at Dinn Ranch is about 56 MMcfe/d.
East Texas
We plan to drill up to 20 wells in East Texas in 2004. We are active in four main fields  Carthage, Oak Hill, Willow Springs and Woodlawn. Year-to-date, we have drilled 15 wells. Our working interest ranges from 45-100%. During the third quarter, we drilled 2 successful wells in the Oak Hill field and 2 successful wells in the Woodlawn field. All the wells had more than 100' of net gas pay and initial production per well averages about 1.1 MMcfe/d. We recently drilled our first successful well in the Willow Springs field on acreage acquired earlier in the year. Completion is underway.
Southern Louisiana  MOOSE Prospect
Moose, a wildcat discovery announced in July, was tested and is now producing 30 MMcfe/d. We plan to drill an offset well in mid-2005 to help size the Moose discovery. BP operates Moose and we hold a 25% working interest. We have an interest in more than 6,000 acres around this discovery. Moose was drilled to nearly 23,700' to test a high potential exploration prospect in the prolific Deep Tuscaloosa Trend. The well offsets the giant Judge Digby field in Point Coupee Parish. We logged 50' of net gas pay in the well. We drilled a dry hole with our East Donner Prospect. Newfield had a 25% interest in this 16,200' test.
Gulf of Mexico
In the Gulf of Mexico, we drilled 10 wells in the third quarter with no dry holes. Including workover and completion operations, four rigs are currently active.
South Timbalier 299 #1
During the third quarter, we drilled three discoveries at ST 299. The field is located in 320' of water. Two of the wells found pay at 2,500' and the third well found multiple oil and gas bearing sands between 2,500' and 9,000'. We're planning to install a platform with first production expected in the second half of 2005. We have a 75% non-operated interest in this discovery.
 
GOM Development Programs
The following is a list of significant Gulf of Mexico development programs that are underway. Combined, these developments are expected to add nearly 85 MMcfe/d of gross gas production. The new developments will be on-line between Nov. 1 and mid-2005.
West Cameron 77
The West Cameron 77 deep shelf discovery, located about 10 miles offshore Louisiana in about 40 feet of water, tested 15 MMcfe/d from a single sand. The well found approximately 120' of net gas pay in two zones between 16,800' - 17,600'. The well was deepened to 19,603' (18,500' vertical depth) and encountered an additional zone that appears to have possible pay over a large gross interval, however due to a mechanical problem, the deepest sand was not tested. A facility is being fabricated and we expect first production of about 15 MMcfe/d in April 2005. The field will qualify for 15 Bcf of royalty relief under the Minerals Management Service's rules. We operate the WC 77 discovery with a 45% working interest in a joint development area covering portions of WC 77 and WC 96, prior to payout. After payout, our interest, subject to a 25% back in by another operator, will be 33.75%.
Hurricane Ivan Impact
As a result of Hurricane Ivan, we deferred approximately 2.5 Bcfe of 2004 production. About half of this was deferred in the third quarter. At this time, we still have about 19 MMcfe/d gross operated, or 9 MMcfe/d net, shut-in awaiting repairs to facilities and pipelines. In addition, we have 13 MMcfe/d net still shut-in on outside operated platforms.
Mid-Continent
We are currently operating seven drilling rigs in the Mid-Continent. Year to date, 107 operated wells have been completed or are in various stages of completion (excluding our Cherokee Basin CBM play). In addition, we have participated in 50 outside-operated wells.
Stiles Ranch and Buffalo Wallow
We are operating three drilling rigs in Hemphill and Wheeler Counties, Texas where current production is 22 MMcfe/d. We plan to drill 25 wells in these areas in 2004; 20 have reached total depth year-to-date. We have a 100% working interest.
 
WACCAWH Project
Year-to-date, more than 40 wells have been drilled, three wells are currently drilling and four wells are being completed. Gross operated production is about 25 MMcf/d. Our first two WACCAWH pilot wells to the south have been completed in the Woodford Shale and are cleaning-up after frac. The wells are being completed and will be commingled with other WACCAWH intervals.
Arkoma CBM Project
Located in Pittsburg, Hughes and Coal Counties in the Arkoma Basin, our horizontal CBM play consists of two shallow coal seams (4'-5' thick) above the WACCAWH play at 2,000'-3,500'. We have one CBM rig drilling our first four-well horizontal pilot on 640 acres for the Booch Coal. Three horizontal wells have been drilled to date. A second horizontal CBM pilot will target the deeper Hartshorne Coal and should spud in late October.
Cherokee Basin CBM Area
We are operating 2-3 drilling rigs and have drilled 75 wells since acquiring these assets in July. Since closing, 10 new wells have been brought on-line, 30 have been completed and eight are in various stages of completion. A significant number of inactive wells have been brought on-line and gross production is up 2 MMcf/d since mid-July. About 100 new wells will be drilled and completed prior to year-end. We added to our acreage in this area by acquiring interests from another operator in late September.
Rocky Mountains
We are currently running three drilling rigs in our Monument Butte Field, a 110,000-acre oil field located in the Uinta Basin of Northeast Utah. Current net field production is 7,700 barrels of oil equivalent. The field has estimated oil-in-place of more than 2 billion barrels. From announcement date to closing was just 21 days. Gary Packer, formerly our leader of acquisition and development efforts in the Gulf of Mexico, was named to manage our new Rockies operation. With the recent strength in oil prices over the past several months, we have used hedging markets to ensure attractive future oil prices for expected Monument Butte production through 2010. Most of the hedges we have added, approximately 87%, are in the form of three-way collars at an average weighted price of $27.55 x $33.82 x $50.73. Please see the tables at the end of this publication for a complete listing of our crude hedges.
2005 Production Estimate
The Company expects to produce 255  270 Bcfe in 2005, an increase of 6  12% over 2004 estimated production of about 240 Bcfe. Preliminary capital spending for 2005 is estimated at about $850  900 million. A final budget is being prepared and will be submitted to the Company's board of directors for approval in February 2005.
Fourth Quarter 2004 Estimates
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Company's natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be 49  54 Bcf (533  590 MMcf/d).
