     On August 27, 2004, Newfield Exploration Company acquired Inland Resources Inc. ("Inland") for $575 million. The purchase was funded through concurrent offerings of Newfield common stock and debt. Newfield issued 5.4 million shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $52.85 per share and $325 million of its 6% senior subordinated notes due 2014.
     On August 30, 2004, Newfield filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Report") providing the foregoing information under Item 2.01 of the Report and stating under Item 9.01 of the Report that the required historical financial statements and other financial information with respect to Inland and the required pro forma financial information with respect to the acquisition and offerings of common stock and debt would be filed by an amendment to the Report. The Report is hereby amended to replace Item 9.01 of the Report with the following:
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements as of June 30, 2004 and for the six months then ended and for the calendar year ended December 31, 2003 that give effect to the acquisition and the issuance of the common stock and notes described therein begin on page F-1 of this report.
     The consolidated financial statements of Inland filed herewith as of December 31, 2003 and for the year then ended have been audited by Hein & Associates LLP, as set forth in their report thereon filed herewith. Such consolidated financial statements are filed herewith in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

     On August 27, 2004, Newfield Exploration Company acquired Inland Resources Inc. for $575 million. The purchase was funded through concurrent offerings of Newfield common stock and debt. Newfield issued 5.4 million shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $52.85 per share and $325 million of its 6% senior subordinated notes due 2014.
     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information combines the historical consolidated balance sheets and income statements of Newfield and Inland and gives effect to the issuance of the common stock and the notes and to the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is based on the following assumptions and adjustments:
     The historical income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2003 is derived from the audited financial statements of Inland and Newfield. The historical income statement information for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 and the historical balance sheet information as of June 30, 2004 are derived from the unaudited financial statements of Inland and Newfield. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be read together with the historical financial statements and related notes of Newfield and Inland.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the companies had always been combined or if the transactions had occurred as of the dates indicated above. They do not purport to indicate the future results that Newfield will experience. Further, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information does not reflect the effect of restructuring charges that will be incurred to fully integrate and operate the combined organization more efficiently or anticipated synergies resulting from the acquisition. The restructuring activities to integrate the companies may result in asset rationalization and other activities.

Board of Directors Inland Resources Inc. Denver, Colorado
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Inland Resources Inc. as of December 31, 2003, and the related statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Inland Resources Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (Unaudited)
SFAS No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities," prescribes guidelines for computing a standardized measure of future net cash flows and changes therein relating to estimated proved reserves. The Company has followed these guidelines, which are briefly discussed below. Future cash inflows and future production and development costs are determined by applying year end prices and costs to the estimated quantities of oil and gas to be produced. Estimated future income taxes are computed using current statutory income tax rates including consideration for estimated future statutory depletion. The resulting future net cash flows are reduced to present value amounts by applying a 10% ("PV10%") annual discount factor.
The assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and, as such, do not necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues to be derived from those reserves nor their present value. The limitations inherent in the reserve quantity estimation process are equally applicable to the standardized measure computations since these estimates are the basis for the valuation process.
The following summary sets forth the Company's future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves based on the standardized measure prescribed in SFAS No. 69 (in thousands):
 
The principal sources of changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2003 (in thousands):
Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities (Unaudited)
The reserve information presented below is based upon reports prepared by the Company's in-house petroleum engineer. An independent engineering firm reviewed properties comprising 80% of the PV10% value of the reserves. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of producing oil and gas properties. As a result, revisions to previous estimates are expected to occur as additional production data becomes available or economic factors change.
Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are those expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The fluctuation of oil and gas prices has a significant impact on the standardized measure. Future increases or decreases in oil or gas prices increase or decrease the standardized measure accordingly. As of December 31, 2003, the Company used prices of $29.52 per Bbl and $5.52 per Mcf.
Presented below is a summary of the changes in estimated proved reserves of the Company, all of which are located in the United States, for the year ended December 31, 2003:
