We have recently added significant hedge positions. Notice that we are using predominately wide band collars, three-ways and floors. This allows us to ensure adequate cash flow to fund our 2005 budget and preserves significant exposure to upside in oil and gas prices. Please see below for a complete update on all of our hedge positions.
