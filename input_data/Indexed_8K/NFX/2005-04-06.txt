Newfield Exploration Company has entered into an agreement with Diamond Offshore Services Company to sell its interest in the Enserch Garden Banks floating production facility and related equipment (EGB) for net proceeds to Newfield of about $7.2 million. The sale is expected to close in September 2005. Newfield wrote-off the entire book value of the EGB in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result, Newfield will recognize an after tax gain for financial accounting purposes of approximately $4.7 million upon completion of the sale. While the sale will have little effect on Newfield's effective tax rate, it will have a positive effect on current taxes payable during 2005.
