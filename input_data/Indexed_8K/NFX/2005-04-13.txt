     On August 27, 2004, Newfield Exploration Company acquired Inland Resources Inc. for $575 million. The purchase was funded through concurrent offerings of Newfield common stock and debt. Newfield issued 5.4 million shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $52.85 per share and $325 million of its 6 5/8% senior subordinated notes due 2014.
     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement combines the historical consolidated income statements of Newfield and Inland and gives effect to the issuance of the common stock and the notes and to the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement is based on the following assumptions and adjustments:
     The Newfield historical income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2004 is derived from the audited financial statements of Newfield and includes Inland's results for the period from August 28, 2004 (the day following the acquisition) through December 31, 2004. The Inland historical income statement information is derived from the unaudited financial statements of Inland for the period from January 1, 2004 through August 27, 2004 (the date of the acquisition). The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement should be read together with the historical financial statements and related notes of Newfield and Inland.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement is presented for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the companies had always been combined or if the transactions had occurred as of the dates indicated above. They do not purport to indicate the future results that Newfield will experience. Further, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statement does not reflect the effect of restructuring charges to fully integrate and operate the combined organization.
