Change of Control
.      Notwithstanding any provision herein or in any Award agreement to the contrary, (i) upon a Change of Control all Restricted Stock Awards then outstanding shall automatically be fully vested and nonforfeitable and (ii) upon a "change of control," as defined in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan, or at such earlier time as the Committee may provide, all Options then outstanding shall automatically be fully exercisable. Further, upon a Change of Control, the Committee, acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval of any Holder, may, no later than ten days after the approval by the stockholders of the Company of such Change of Control (other than of the type described in clause (v) of the definition of "Change of Control") or no later than thirty days after a Change of Control of the type described in clause (v) of the definition of "Change of Control," effect one or more of the following alternatives with respect to outstanding Options, which alternatives may vary among individual Holders and which may vary among Options held by any individual Holder: (A) accelerate the time at which Options then outstanding may be exercised, (B) require the mandatory surrender to the Company by all or selected Holders of some or all of the outstanding Options held by such Holders (irrespective of whether such Options are then exercisable under the provisions of the Plan) as of a date, before or after such Change of Control, specified by the Committee, in which event the Committee shall thereupon cancel such Options and cause the Company to pay to each Holder an amount of cash per share equal to the excess, if any, of the Change of Control Value of the shares subject to such Option over the exercise price(s) under such Options for such shares, (C) make such adjustments to Options then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to reflect such Change of Control (
provided
,
however
, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine that no adjustment is necessary to Options then outstanding), or (D) provide that the number and class of shares of Common Stock covered by an Option theretofore granted shall be adjusted so that such Option thereafter covers the number and class of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which the Holder would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement of merger, consolidation or sale of assets and dissolution if, immediately prior to such transaction, the Holder had been the holder of record of the
 
 
 
number of shares of Common Stock then covered by such Option. The provisions of this Paragraph IX(c) shall not terminate any rights of the Holder to further payments pursuant to any other agreement with the Company following a Change of Control.
