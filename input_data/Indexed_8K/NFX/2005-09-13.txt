Regulation FD Disclosure
On September 12, 2005, Newfield issued a press release providing an operational update following Hurricane Katrina. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
The statements in the press release regarding likely total deferred production volumes, expected total production for 2005 and the effects of increases in commodity prices are forward-looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, well and waterflood performance, severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes), the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services and other factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
