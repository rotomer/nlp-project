Third Quarter 2005
For the third quarter of 2005, Newfield reported a net loss of $0.2 million. The loss for the quarter reflects the following items:
Without the effects of these items, net income for the quarter would have been $128 million, or $1.00 per share.
A significant portion of our expected winter Gulf of Mexico production was hedged in various instruments. Hurricanes forced the deferral of 18-20 Bcfe of our 2005 production, triggering the loss of hedge accounting for some of our winter contracts. As a result, accounting rules dictated that we take a charge on those contracts, said David A. Trice, Newfield Chairman, President and CEO. Higher commodity prices in the wake of the storms should offset the revenues associated with our deferred production.
Revenues in the third quarter of 2005 were $460 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $296 million. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
.
By comparison, Newfields net income for the third quarter of 2004 was $77 million, or $0.63 per share. Without the effect of unrealized commodity derivative income of $10 million ($7 million after tax) net income for the third quarter of 2004 would have been $70 million, or $0.58 per share. Revenues in the same period were $328 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $268 million in the third quarter of 2004. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
.
Newfields production in the third quarter of 2005 was 59.2 Bcfe, reflecting an estimated 6 Bcfe deferred production related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Production in the third quarter of 2004 was 60.7 Bcfe. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the third quarters of 2005 and 2004.
 
 
(1)
Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.
(2)
Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than (a) three-way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, and (b) other contracts that no longer qualify for hedge accounting as a result of the storms. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $6.97 per Mcf and $5.06 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $47.83 per Bbl and $36.50 per Bbl for the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfields lease operating expense (LOE) in the third quarter of 2005 was $0.88 per Mcfe, compared to LOE of $0.66 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2004. LOE per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2005 was adversely impacted by deferred production of approximately 6 Bcfe related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Production and other taxes in the third quarter of 2005 reflect significantly higher commodity prices and were $0.30 per Mcfe compared to production and other taxes of $0.21 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. DD&A expense in the third quarter of 2005 was $2.14 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense of $1.95 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. G&A expense in the third quarter of 2005 was $0.43 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense of $0.36 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. G&A expense in the third quarter of 2005 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $12 million. Capitalized direct internal costs were $8 million in the third quarter of 2004.
Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2005 were $282 million.
Year-to-Date 2005
For the first nine months of 2005, Newfield posted net income of $164 million, or $1.29 per share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. Earnings for the nine months of 2005 reflect the following items:
Without the effects of these items, net income for the first nine months of 2005 would have been $383 million, or $3.00 per share.
By comparison, in the first nine months of 2004, net income was $222 million, or $1.91 per share, on revenues of $916 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $935 million in the first nine months of 2005 compared to $661 million in the same period of 2004. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
.
Despite the deferral of an estimated 6 Bcfe due to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, production volumes for the first nine months of 2005 increased 10% above the same period of 2004. The Company produced 191.4 Bcfe in the first nine months of 2005 compared to 174.1 Bcfe in the first nine months of 2004. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the first nine months of 2005 and 2004:
(1)
Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.
(2)
Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than (a) three-way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, and (b) other contracts that no longer qualify for hedge accounting as a result of the storms. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $6.52 per Mcf and $5.07 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $43.84 per Bbl and $33.62 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
In the first nine months of 2005, LOE, stated on a unit of production basis, averaged $0.74 per Mcfe, compared to LOE of $0.57 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. Production taxes in the first nine months of 2005 were $0.21 per Mcfe compared to production taxes of $0.17 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. DD&A expense in the first nine months of 2005 was $2.11 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense of $1.89 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. G&A expense in the first nine months of 2005 was $0.40 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense of $0.34 per Mcfe in the prior year.
 
G&A expense in the first nine months of 2005 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $34 million compared to $23 million in the same period of 2004.
Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2005 totaled $799 million.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because the timing and amount of these items cannot be reasonably estimated and affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
Our quarterly consolidated statement of income for 2005 and 2004 includes the effects of these items:
A reconciliation of earnings stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
In the first nine months of 2005 and 2004 our consolidated statement of income includes the effects of the following items:
A reconciliation of earnings stated without the effects of certain items to net income is shown below:
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:
Fourth Quarter 2005 Estimates
 
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Companys natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be 40 - 47 Bcf (435 - 510 MMcf/d). Based on recent gas price escalations, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Companys Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70 - $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
The Companys oil production, including international liftings, in the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be 1.8 - 2.0 million barrels (20,000 - 22,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 4,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $3 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
LOE is expected to be $42 - $46 million ($0.77 - $0.85 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter of 2005. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2005 are expected to be $25 - $28 million ($0.48 - $0.53 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. The increased LOE estimate for the fourth quarter reflects the deferral of about 13 Bcfe of Gulf production and other costs related to recent hurricanes.
General and Administrative Expense
G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be $29 - $32 million ($0.54 - $0.59 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $16 - $18 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Companys incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
Interest Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Companys interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be $4 - $5 million ($0.07 - $0.09 per Mcfe). As of October 26, 2005, Newfield had $10 million in outstanding borrowings under its credit arrangements. The remainder of long-term debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $875 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be about $11 - $12 million.
Income Taxes
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2005 to be about 35 - 39%. About 75% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. The Company relies on a proven growth strategy that includes balancing acquisitions with drill bit opportunities. Newfields areas of operation include the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid-Continent, the Uinta Basin of the Rocky Mountains and offshore Malaysia. The Company has international development projects underway in the U.K. North Sea and in Bohai Bay, China.
**The statements set forth in this release regarding estimated or anticipated fourth quarter results and production volumes are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors. Newfields ability to produce oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico is dependent on infrastructure (such as host platforms, pipelines and onshore processing facilities) owned by third parties. Much of this infrastructure was damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result, it is difficult to predict when production will be permitted to resume. Other factors include drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources and labor conditions. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.

Exhibit 99.2
@NFX is periodically published to keep shareholders aware of current operating activities at Newfield. It may include estimates of expected production volumes, costs and expenses, recent changes to hedging positions and commodity pricing.
October 26, 2005
This edition of @NFX includes:
 
 
 
Year-to-date, four storms have caused production deferrals in the Gulf of Mexico - Dennis, Arlene, Katrina and Rita. Newfield expects that the full-year impact of these storms will result in the deferral of 18-20 Bcfe from the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 6 Bcfe of production was deferred in the third quarter of 2005.
Since Hurricane Rita, Newfield has restored Gulf production of approximately 125 MMcfe/d net out of total net production of about 320 MMcfe/d. Only about 14 MMcfe/d net is associated with lost platforms or structures. The remainder is related to damage to host platforms, pipeline infrastructure and onshore processing facilities. Newfield estimates that about 250 MMcfe/d will be on-line in mid-November and 300 MMcfe/d net will be on-line in the Gulf of Mexico at year-end.
The table below outlines Newfields annual production guidance through 2007. The Companys major development projects outside of the Gulf of Mexico remain on schedule.
Focus Area Updates
ONSHORE GULF COAST
During the third quarter, our onshore Gulf Coast team drilled 14 successful wells out of 15 attempts and were on track to drill 15-20 exploration wells and 50-60 development wells in 2005. We have seven operated rigs running along the Gulf Coast and are participating in seven outside operated wells.
Sarita Field Area
We are drilling two wells in the Sarita Field area of Kenedy County -- the S.K. East B-70 and the S.K. East B-71. The wells are being drilled under our recent drilling venture in South Texas with Exxon-Mobil. We have a 100% interest in the wells, prior to an optional back-in by XOM.
Monte Christo
The Johnson #77 well was successful, testing 12 MMcf/d. The well is located in the Monte Christo Field area in Hidalgo County, Texas. We have a 100% working interest in #77 well. Since the beginning of the year, weve drilled four successful wells out of five attempts in the area. Total field production is about 30 MMcfe/d and limited by facilities. We expect the field to increase to nearly 40 MMcfe/d late this year.
Zapata County Exploration
Our recent Bravo discovery is now producing 5 MMcfe/d (gross). Bravo is located in Zapata County, Texas. We are drilling an offset to this discovery - the Salinas #1 well. We have an 88% interest in Bravo.
We drilled two successful Lobo wells in Zapata County on our Varal Ranches Prospect. The Varal Ranches #1 tested 4.4 MMcfe/d (gross). The Varal Ranches #2 (an offset to #1) is currently being completed. Combined, the wells are expected to produce more than 10 MMcfe/d following the completion of a pipeline in December. We are planning to drill the Varal Ranches #3 well in late 2005.
Val Verde Basin
We hold more than 100,000 lease acres in the Val Verde Basin of southwest Texas. In the second quarter, we completed a bite-size acquisition of the Snakebite Field, adding 12,000 acres north of our Venom Field and as many as 35 additional drilling locations. Since the closing of this acquisition, we have drilled three successful development wells and a fourth well is currently drilling. The three successful wells are being completed and production is expected late this year. We recently completed the construction of a pipeline to connect Venom with gathering assets acquired in the Snakebite transaction. The pipeline provides for 30 MMcf/d of gross capacity from Venom. We have an 80-100% working interest in Venom and Snakebite and control more than 26,000 net acres in the area.
East Texas
We drilled three successful wells out of as many attempts in a new East Texas exploration area. We are planning to drill additional wells in the area late this year. Our working interest in the wells ranges from 10-30%.
GULF OF MEXICO
Hurricanes deferred planned activities in the Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter. We have about 125 MMcfe/d on-line today and 195 MMcfe/d remains shut-in. Our shut-ins are primarily related to pipelines and onshore processing facilities. Based on what we know today, we estimate that we will have about 250 MMcfe/d back on line in mid-November and that well be up to 300 MMcfe/d at year-end. Our prior estimate for deferrals - or 18-20 Bcfe - is still a good forecast for the full-year 05 impact.
We are currently operating four jack-up rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Three of the rigs are drilling deep shelf wells. We expect to run three to four jack-up rigs throughout 2006, allowing us to execute our program of 15 traditional shelf wells and 4-5 deep shelf wells.
MID-CONTINENT
In 2005, we have drilled 215 wells and are now operating 10 rigs. We drilled 67 wells in the third quarter and expect to drill close to 300 wells in 2005.
Oklahoma Wash Play
 
We are operating three rigs in Roger Mills County in western Oklahoma. A second Sweetwater well was recently spud, the Gatlin 1-12 (NFX WI 83%). Late in the third quarter, the Armstrong 6-14 (NFX WI 80%) in Cheyenne was turned to sales for 3.8 MMcf/d (gross). We expect to drill 13 operated wells in the area in 2005.
Texas Wash Play
 
We are currently operating four drilling rigs on the Texas Panhandle side of the Wash Play, three in the Stiles Ranch Field and one in the Briscoe Area in Wheeler County. A fifth drilling rig is currently moving in and rigging up in Stiles Ranch. Late in the third quarter, three wells were turned to sales: the Britt Ranch F 6-4 at 3.5 MMcf/d and two wells (Britt Ranch F 6-5 and E 8-4) at 3.5 MMcf/d each. We have a 100% interest in Stiles Ranch and in the Briscoe Area. Gross operated daily production in the Texas Wash Play is 35 MMcfe/d from 84 wells. For 2005, we plan to drill 25 wells in the Texas Wash Play.
WACCAWH
Located in Pittsburg, Hughes and Coal Counties, Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin, the WACCAWH intervals include the Wapanucka Lime, Cromwell Sand, Caney, Woodford Shales, and the Hunton Lime. We have been active in the play since 2002 and have drilled 84 wells to date -- 29 in 2005. We have amassed over 100,000 net lease acres and a multi-year drilling inventory. There are three rigs drilling in the area and two wells are being completed. We expect to drill and participate in 35-40 WACCAWH wells in 2005.
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
Through the end of the third quarter, we have drilled 137 wells in our Monument Butte Field. Gross production is 9,550 BOPD and 23 MMcf/d. We are operating four drilling rigs in the field. Our Environmental Impact Statement should receive final approval in November, which should help to expedite drilling in 2006. We continue to study the deep gas potential beneath Monument Butte and are planning several wells over the next few months. Late this year, we plan to participate in our first deep gas well on joint pooled acreage. In addition, we will have a 49% interest in three non-operated deep gas wells planned for 2006. 
During the third quarter, we signed a joint venture with another operator on an exploitation opportunity covering 32,000 acres in the Uinta Basin. The area is called Horseshoe Bend and we initiated a well-workover project where 10 existing wells have been returned to production, adding 50 BOPD.  We are permitting future drilling locations now and plan to drill at least six wells in 2006. Newfield will have a 75% interest in this venture.
In the third quarter, we entered into a joint exploration venture with Bill Barrett Group and will have a 40% interest in the Red River B play on 18,000 acres in the Williston Basin. We are drilling our first well under this joint venture today.
INTERNATIONAL
We have major development projects underway in China, Malaysia and the North Sea and these developments will move our international production from about 6 Bcfe in 2005 to more than 60 Bcfe in 2008.
Malaysia
In the third quarter, we drilled four successful wells and one dry hole. The Puteri discovery, located in the central portion of shallow-water PM 318, found more than 200 of net oil pay. We expect to drill two additional targets adjacent to Puteri in the first quarter of 2006. Puteri will be developed using existing production infrastructure in our Penara field. First oil production is expected in early 2008.
We drilled three field development wells in the Abu field, also located on PM 318. Our development plans for this field are on-track and first production of 18,000 BOPD gross is expected in early 2007.
Fourth Quarter 2005 Estimates
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Companys natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be 40 - 47 Bcf (435 - 510 MMcf/d). Based on recent gas price escalations, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Companys Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70 - $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
The Companys oil production, including international liftings, in the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be 1.8 - 2.0 million barrels (20,000 - 22,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 4,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $3 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
LOE is expected to be $42 - $46 million ($0.77 - $0.85 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter of 2005. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2005 are expected to be $25 - $28 million ($0.48 - $0.53 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. The increased LOE estimate for the fourth quarter reflects the deferral of about 13 Bcfe of Gulf production and other costs related to recent hurricanes.
General and Administrative Expense
G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be $29 - $32 million ($0.54 - $0.59 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $16 - $18 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Companys incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
Interest Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Companys interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be $4 - $5 million ($0.07 - $0.09 per Mcfe). As of October 26, 2005, Newfield had $10 million in outstanding borrowings under its credit arrangements. The remainder of long-term debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $875 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be about $11 - $12 million.
Income Taxes
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2005 to be about 35 - 39%. About 75% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
