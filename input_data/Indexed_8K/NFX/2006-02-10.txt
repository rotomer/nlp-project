2005 Highlights:
 
Fourth Quarter 2005
 
For the fourth quarter of 2005, Newfield reported net income of $184 million, or $1.43 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Earnings for the quarter reflect the impact of the following items:
Without the effect of these items, net income for the quarter would have been $99 million, or $0.77 per share.
Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $443 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $282 million. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
By comparison, Newfields net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $90 million, or $0.72 per share. Net income in this period was negatively affected by a $23 million after-tax charge ($0.18 per share) for the impairment of the Enserch Garden Banks floating production facility (EGB) and related pipelines and processing facility and a ceiling test writedown of $10 million ($0.08 per share) for dry hole expense in the U.K. North Sea. Without the effect of these items, net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 would have been $123 million, or $0.98 per share. Revenues in the same period were $437 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $304 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Newfields production in the fourth quarter of 2005 was 50.3 Bcfe, reflecting an estimated 16 Bcfe of deferred production related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Production in the fourth quarter of 2004 was 69.5 Bcfe. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004.
(1)
Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.
(2)
Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $7.16 per Mcf and $6.11 per Mcf for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $46.27 per Bbl and $38.41 per Bbl for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfields lease operating expense (LOE) in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $1.09 per Mcfe, compared to LOE of $0.69 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2004. Production and other taxes in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $0.45 per Mcfe compared to production and other taxes of $0.17 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. DD&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $2.34 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense of $2.04 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $0.56 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense of $0.35 per Mcfe in the same period of 2004. G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $11 million. Capitalized direct internal costs were $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $364 million.
Full-year 2005
 
For 2005, Newfield posted net income of $348 million, or $2.73 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Earnings for 2005 reflect the impact of the following items:
Without the effect of these items, net income for 2005 would have been $482 million, or $3.77 per share.
Net income in 2004 was $312 million, or $2.63 per share, on revenues of $1.4 billion. Net income, excluding a $23 million after-tax charge ($0.19 per share) for the impairment of the EGB and a $17 million ceiling test writedown ($0.14 per share) associated with dry hole costs in the North Sea, would have been $352 million, or $2.97 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.2 billion in 2005 compared to $965 million in 2004. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
.
In 2005, Newfield produced 241.6 Bcfe which reflects the deferral of about 22 Bcfe related to hurricanes. Production in 2004 totaled 243.6 Bcfe. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for 2005 and 2004:
 
(1)
Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.
(2)
Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $6.65 per Mcf and $5.36 per Mcf for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $44.36 per Bbl and $35.27 per Bbl for 2005 and 2004, respectively.
LOE in 2005 averaged $0.85 per Mcfe, compared to LOE of $0.62 per Mcfe in 2004. Production taxes in 2005 were $0.26 per Mcfe compared to production taxes of $0.17 per Mcfe in 2004. DD&A expense in 2005 was $2.15 per Mcfe compared to DD&A expense of $1.94 per Mcfe in 2004. G&A expense in 2005 was $0.43 per Mcfe compared to G&A expense of $0.34 per Mcfe in the prior year.
 
G&A expense in 2005 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $46 million compared to $32 million in 2004.
 
Capital expenditures in 2005 totaled approximately $1.2 billion.
Proved Reserves and Capital Activity
 
 
Newfields total reserves at year-end 2005 were 2.0 Tcfe, an increase of 12% over year-end 2004 reserves. Reserve additions from all sources were 467 Bcfe with only 19 Bcfe (4%) of the total coming from acquisitions. Sales of reserves in 2005 totaled 8 Bcfe.
 
 
Oil and Gas Reserves*
 
*These estimates were prepared by Newfield. As a requirement of Newfields credit facility, independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least 70% of the present value of Newfields proved reserves. For December 31, 2005, the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing 81% of our proved reserves, and for such properties the reserves were within 3% of the reserves Newfield reported for such properties.
Capital Expenditures
2006-07 Production Guidance
 
The damage to infrastructure, pipelines and processing facilities continues to impact Newfields Gulf of Mexico production in early 2006. Newfield is currently producing about 215 MMcfe/d and has about 80 MMcfe/d of deliverability off-line. The Company expects that Gulf
production of
250 MMcfe/d will be on-line by the end of the first quarter of 2006 and 275 MMcfe/d by mid-year. In addition, 2006 Gulf production will be negatively impacted by the inability to execute drilling and recompletion programs in the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Newfield expects that deferrals associated with hurricanes will be about 15 Bcfe in 2006.
 
 
 
 
 
For 2006, Newfield expects its total Company production to be 250-265 Bcfe, an increase of 3-10% over 2005 production. For 2007, Newfield expects production will be 300-320 Bcfe, an increase of 20-25%.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because the timing and amount of these items cannot be reasonably estimated and affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
Newfields consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004 includes the effects of these items:
A reconciliation of earnings stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
For 2005 and 2004, Newfields consolidated statement of income includes the effects of the following items:
A reconciliation of earnings stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:
First Quarter 2006 Estimates
 
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Companys natural gas production in the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be 42 - 47 Bcf (465 - 520 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Companys Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70 - $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
The Companys oil production, including international liftings, in the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be 1.8 - 2.0 million barrels (20,000 - 22,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 4,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $6 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
LOE is expected to be $47 - $53 million ($0.87 - $0.96 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2006. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be $21 - $23 million ($0.37 - $0.42 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. The increased LOE estimate for the first quarter reflects the continued deferral of Gulf of Mexico production and other costs related to 2005 hurricanes.
General and Administrative Expense
G&A expense for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be $33 - $36 million ($0.60 - $0.66 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $15 - $17 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Companys incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
Interest Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Companys interest expense for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be $5 - $6 million ($0.09 - $0.10 per Mcfe). As of February 8, 2006, Newfield had no outstanding borrowings under its credit arrangements. The remainder of long-term debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $875
million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be about $11 - $12 million.
 
 
 
Income Taxes
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the first quarter of 2006 to be about 35 - 39%. About 60-65% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. Newfields domestic areas of operation include the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid-Continent and the Uinta Basin of the Rocky Mountains. The Company has international exploration and development projects underway offshore Malaysia and China, and in the U.K. North Sea.
**The statements set forth in this release regarding estimated or anticipated development and drilling plans, capital expenditures and production volumes are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors. Newfields ability to produce oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico is dependent on infrastructure (such as host platforms, pipelines and onshore processing facilities) owned by third parties. Much of this infrastructure was damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result, it is difficult to predict when production will be permitted to resume. Other factors include drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources and labor conditions. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.

This edition of @NFX includes:
 
 
 
 
 
Our 2006 capital budget is $1.9 billion, which reflects the large development projects underway and the high level of activity in our focus areas. The total includes $1.6 billion for new capital projects, $180 million for hurricane repairs in the Gulf of Mexico
(1)
and $105 million for capitalized interest and overhead. We estimate that service cost inflation will equate to approximately 12% in 2006.
As a comparison, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in 2005. The 2005 total included about $1 billion for capital projects and $95 million for capitalized interest and overhead.
Categories of major expenditures for 2006 include:
Our capital budget represents a robust drilling program for 2006 both in the domestic U.S. and internationally. The following table details expenditures by region.
2006 Major Expenditures By Region (in millions)
 
(1)
Insurance property damage proceeds are estimated at $128 million. The remaining repair costs of approximately $52 million are expected to be offset by proceeds from business interruption insurance.
We were impacted by five named storms in the Gulf of Mexico, two of which were catastrophic. These storms caused 2005 production deferrals of about 22 BCF. We estimate that we will have an additional 15 Bcfe of deferred production in 2006. This does not include production that would have been expected from drilling in the second half of 2005. The 2006 deferrals are primarily related to pipelines, onshore processing facilities and loss of or damage to outside-operated host platforms. Additionally, planned workovers, recompletions and new drilling was postponed, which would have led to additional supply in 2006.
We currently have about 215 MMcfe/d on-line in the Gulf and about 80 MMcfe/d of deliverability remains shut in. By the end of the first quarter of 2006, we expect our Gulf production will be about 250 MMcfe/d and 275 MMcfe/d by mid-year 2006.
The table below outlines our production guidance for 2006-07. Major development projects outside of the Gulf of Mexico remain on schedule.
Focus Area Updates
 
ONSHORE GULF COAST
During the fourth quarter, Newfields Onshore Gulf Coast team completed 25 successful wells out of 31 attempts. The Company has eight operated rigs running along the Gulf Coast and is participating in three outside-operated wells.
Sarita Field, South Texas
In October 2005, we signed a joint venture with ExxonMobil covering 52,000 acres in three South Texas counties. Since that time, we have drilled three successful wells. All of the wells are located in the Sarita Field in Kenedy County. Newfield will have a 50% interest in the three wells drilled to date. Under this joint venture, we expect to operate 2-3 rigs throughout 2006.
The S.K. East B-70, drilled to a depth of 17,100, was a significant exploration discovery. The well found 323 of net pay in multiple formations and set up additional drilling locations. The well is under completion and first production is expected in March.
The S.K. East B-71 was drilled to a depth of 14,730 and found 181 of net pay. The S.K. East B-71 has been completed and the first production is expected in late February.
S.K. East B-72 was drilled to a depth of 15,250 and found 185 of net pay. The well is under completion with first production expected in April.
We recently spud two additional wells in the area - the S.K. East B-73 and S.K. East B-74.
Central Texas
We drilled a significant development well in the Provident City area of Lavaca and Colorado Counties. The EPC 1-3 was drilled to 17,480 and found 222 of net gas pay. The well is currently being completed. We are drilling an offset well at this time -- the Baber Estate #1. Newfield is the operator of both wells with a 100% working interest.
Zapata County Exploration
We recently drilled two successful Lobo wells in Zapata County on our Varal Ranches Prospect -- the Varal Ranches #3 and the Adan Volpe #1. We are currently drilling two offset wells -- the Lopez #3 and #4. The Varal Ranches and Bravo areas are currently producing about 14 MMcf/d from six wells. We have an 88% working interest in these wells.
Val Verde Basin
We recently drilled and completed the Rolston 0801 in the Geronimo Creek area (originally called Venom). The well is on-line at about 2 MMcf/d. We are currently drilling a development well in the Poulter Field, Terrell County, and also the Whitehead 7402 in the Four Mills area of Val Verde County. The 7402 well, drilled on air, had a 130 gas flare from the Ellenberger formation. We continue to look for additional opportunities in the Val Verde Basin and recently completed a 70-square-mile 3-D seismic shoot in the Mayfield Ranch area. The new seismic data is expected to be delivered in March.
East Texas
We recently drilled three successful wells (and two dry holes) in our Woodbine area, located in Polk and Tyler Counties. We are testing two additional wells at this time. The Timberwolf #1 recently came on line from a Woodbine completion at 700 BCPD and 3 MMcf/d. The Timberwolf A-2 H was successfully completed in the Austin Chalk and first production is expected later this month. We are drilling two additional wells at this time and expect to drill up to 30 wells in 2006. Our working interest ranges from 10 - 30%.
GULF OF MEXICO
In the fourth quarter, the Gulf of Mexico team drilled two successful wells out of three attempts. Activity levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 were negatively impacted by the storms. We are currently operating four jack-up rigs - three of which are drilling deep shelf wells. We expect to run three to four jack-up rigs throughout 2006, allowing us to execute our program of 15 traditional shelf wells and four to five deep shelf wells. We expect to drill 3-5 deepwater wells in 2006 and commence production from two fields - Rigel and Wrigley.
In January, we drilled a successful well at WC 580 A-5. We are currently drilling a horizontal well (A-6) from this same platform to further enhance recovery of proved reserves.
The Padre Island A-9 B-2 was successful, finding 24 of net of pay. We have a 51% working interest in the field, now producing 30 MMcfe/d gross.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we signed an agreement in the fourth quarter for a 10% interest in Grand Cayman, an outside operated sub-salt prospect. Grand Cayman is located on Garden Banks 517, 518, 562 and 561. The well is expected to spud late in the first quarter. The water depth is about 2,400.
MID-CONTINENT
In the fourth quarter, the Mid-Continent region completed 46 successful wells with no dry holes.
In 2005, we drilled 267 wells, with no dry holes. This includes 128 coal-bed methane wells in our northeastern Oklahoma play. Since 2001, we have more than doubled our net production and proved reserves in the Mid-Continent. Current production is 135 MMcfe/d. We have 11 operated rigs running in our Mid-Continent division.
Mountain Front Wash:
In 2005, we drilled 42 wells in the Mountain Front Wash Play. This play is located in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. We are currently producing 50 MMcfe/d (net) from this region and expect significant production growth in 2006. We are currently operating 5 rigs in the play.
Two of the rigs are running in a new area we call Sweetwater - an area where we acquired leases over the last year that covers more than 30,000 acres. Sweetwater is located in Roger Mills County, located immediately east of our Stiles/Britt Ranch field. Targets are the Marmaton, Cherokee, Red Fork and Atoka Washes. Our first Sweetwater well, the Allison 1-21 (NFX 79% working interest) went to sales in late November and is today producing 1.0 MMcf/d. We plan to drill 23 operated wells in Sweetwater in 2006. Located east of the Sweetwater area is an area we call Cheyenne, located in Roger Mills County. Recent completions include: Channing 1-21 (63% working interest), flowing 1.5 MMcf/d; Thurmond Ranch A 1-4 (62% working interest), flowing 1.3 MMcf/d.
Two of our rigs are running in the Stiles Ranch Field, located in Wheeler County. Targets are the Upper Granite Washes, Cherokee, Redfork and Atoka Washes. Four recent Stiles/Britt Ranch wells began producing: the Britt Ranch C 35-7 at 3.5 MMcf/d, the Britt Ranch B 45-8 at 4.4 MMcf/d, the Britt Ranch E 8-5 at 3.1 MMcf/d and the Britt Ranch H 46-4 at 5.0 MMcf/d. Newfield has a 100% interest in Stiles Ranch. Current gross operated daily production in the Texas Wash Play is 40 MMcf/ed from 65 operated wells. For 2006, we plan to drill 32 operated wells in the area.
Woodford Shale:
 
Located in Pittsburg, Hughes and Coal Counties, Oklahoma in the Arkoma Basin, the Woodford Shale intervals include the Wapanucka Lime, Cromwell Sand, Caney & Woodford Shales, and the Hunton Lime. Newfield has been active in the play since 2002 and has drilled 92 wells to date, 37 in 2005 and amassed more than 100,000 net acres. Currently there are six rigs drilling, four of which are horizontal Woodford tests. Production from recent horizontal wells is encouraging, with 30 and 60 day flow rates averaging 2 MMcf/d. Two additional successes are in the early days of production. Were currently drilling or completing 7 horizontal wells and 2 vertical wells in our Woodford Play. We expect to drill 65 wells in 2006, of which 45 will be horizontals. Since 2001, we have drilled more than 90 wells and production is 35 MMcf/d.
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Rocky Mountains Team completed 59 successful wells out of 63 attempts. We drilled 197 wells in the Monument Butte Field in 2005 and plan to drill about 220 wells in 2006. We plan to run 3-4 rigs this year in our Monument Butte Field and were constructing a third company-owned rig.
We recently drilled our first deep gas test - the Sheep Wash 43-25. The well was drilled to a total depth of nearly 13,000 and found apparent gas pay in the Wasatch, Mesa Verde and Blackhawk formations. The well is currently being completed and we will monitor early production. We have a 29% interest in the well. We plan to drill 4-6 additional deep gas tests across our 100,000 acre position.
We continue to evaluate the area called Horseshoe Bend in the Uinta Basin that we entered after a joint agreement in the third quarter 2005 with another operator. Our well workover initiatives continue with several wells being returned to production with more operations planned. We have permitted numerous future drilling locations in this 32,000-acre area and plan to drill at least six wells in 2006. Newfield has a 75% working interest.
INTERNATIONAL
Major offshore development projects continue in the North Sea, China and Malaysia.
U.K North Sea
In the North Sea, the Grove Field is expected to be on-line in October 2006 and will ramp up to 60 MMcf/d. We are drilling a field development well in the central fault block at this time. The 2006 drilling program will develop the central fault block and test the West Grove fault block. Newfield holds a 100% interest in this field.
Malaysia
We expect to drill 10-12 shallow water wells and our first deepwater test in Malaysia during 2006.
On PM 318, we are fabricating a production platform and FSO for our Abu Field development which is expected to commence production in early 2007. We drilled two successful development wells in Abu in 2005 and thee additional wells are planned in 2006. Also on PM 318, we recently received development approval for our 2005 Puteri discovery. We plan to drill two additional wells to test separate fault blocks at Puteri in 2006. We have not yet booked any reserves associated with Puteri.
We are active on PM 323 our other shallow water block acquired in 2005. We operate PM 323 with a 60% interest. We are appraising West Belumut and moving forward to develop the East Belumut and Chermingat fields. First production of 10,000 - 15,000 BOPD gross is expected in 2008. On PM 323, we plan to use 600 sq. km. of new seismic data to help select prospects and refine leads. We have not yet booked any reserves associated with PM 323.
China
In Bohai Bay, we recently set our production platform and drilled three successful development wells. Production is scheduled for late 2006. We will have a 12% interest in the unit and expect our share of initial production to be about 3,500 BOPD net. Also, we obtained two new blocks in the Pearl River Mouth Basin and are opening an office in Beijing.
FIRST QUARTER 2006 ESTIMATES
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Companys natural gas production in the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be 42 - 47 Bcf (465 - 520 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Companys Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70 - $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
The Companys oil production, including international liftings, in the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be 1.8 - 2.0 million barrels (20,000 - 22,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 4,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $6 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
LOE is expected to be $47 - $53 million ($0.87 - $0.96 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2006. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be $21 - $23 million ($0.37 - $0.42 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities. The increased LOE estimate for the first quarter reflects the continued deferral of Gulf of Mexico production and other costs related to 2005 hurricanes.
General and Administrative Expense
G&A expense for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be $33 - $36 million ($0.60 - $0.66 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $15 - $17 million. G&A expense includes stock and incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Companys incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
Interest Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Companys interest expense for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be $5 - $6 million ($0.09 - $0.10 per Mcfe). As of February 8, 2006, Newfield had no outstanding borrowings under its credit arrangements. The remainder of long-term debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $875 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be about $11 - $12 million.
Income Taxes
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the first quarter of 2006 to be about 35 - 39%. About 60-65% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. Newfields domestic areas of operation include the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid-Continent and the Uinta Basin of the Rocky Mountains. The Company has international exploration and development projects underway offshore Malaysia and China, and in the U.K. North Sea.
**The statements set forth in this publication regarding estimated or anticipated development and drilling plans, capital expenditures and production volumes are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors. Newfields ability to produce oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico is dependent on infrastructure (such as host platforms, pipelines and onshore processing facilities) owned by third parties. Much of this infrastructure was damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result, it is difficult to predict when production will be permitted to resume. Other factors include drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources and labor conditions. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.
