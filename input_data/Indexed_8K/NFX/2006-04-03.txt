EXECUTION VERSION
Exhibit 1.1
March 29, 2006
To the Representatives of the several      Underwriters named in the respective      Pricing Agreements hereinafter described
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     From time to time Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities"), specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Designated Securities"). If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional principal amount of Securities specified in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and the Optional Designated Securities, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively referred to as the "Designated Securities."
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing Agreement.
     1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Designated Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities, the maximum principal amount of Optional Designated Securities, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm and Optional Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated
 
Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm Designated Securities and Optional Designated Securities, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus (as defined) with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement, including a prospectus, (File No. 333-124120) on Form S-3, relating to securities of the Company, including the Securities, to be issued from time to time by the Company. The registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement, including the information (if any) deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430A or Rule 430B under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus covering the Securities dated April 26, 2005 in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available to the Underwriters by the Company to meet requests of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Designated Securities (or in the form first made available to the Underwriters by the Company to meet requests of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus," and the term "preliminary prospectus" means any preliminary form of the Prospectus. For purposes of this Agreement, "free writing prospectus" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, "Time of Sale Prospectus" means the preliminary prospectus together with the free writing prospectuses, if any, prepared by or on behalf of the Company or used or referred to by the Company in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), and any other documents or information identified in Schedule II hereto and as of the Time of Sale (as defined on Schedule II hereto). As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement," "Basic Prospectus," "preliminary prospectus," "Time of Sale Prospectus" and "Prospectus" shall include the documents, if any, incorporated by reference therein. The terms "supplement," "amendment," and "amend" as used herein with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or free writing prospectus shall include all documents subsequently filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
     2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
 
     (a) The Registration Statement has become effective; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or threatened by the Commission.

Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus.
     The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Overallotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the principal amount of Optional Designated Securities set forth in such Pricing Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Designated Securities sin excess of the Firm Designated Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Designated Securities may be exercised by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate principal amount of Optional Designated Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Designated Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement.
     The principal amount of Optional Designated Securities to be added to the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the principal amount of Optional Designated Securities which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter; provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the principal amount of Optional Designated Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Designated Securities which the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 1,000 dollars). The total principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate principal amount of Optional Designated Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
     4. Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in the form specified in such Pricing Agreement, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance as specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Designated Securities, all in the manner and at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "First Time of Delivery," and (ii) with respect to the Optional Designated Securities, if any, in the manner and at the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Designated Securities, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date,
 
if not the First Time of Delivery, being herein called the "Second Time of Delivery." Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery."
     5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities:
     (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Time of Sale Prospectus after the date of the Pricing Agreement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus relating to such Designated Securities and prior to any Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Designated Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus after any Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Designated Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to such Designated Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Designated Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to such Designated Securities or suspending any such qualification, promptly to use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order;
     (b) Not to take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriter that the Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder; and to file promptly all material required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, including any pricing term sheet identified on Schedule II hereto.
     (c) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Designated Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary
 
to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law;
     (d) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Designated Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which the Designated Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
     (e) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Designated Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
     (f) On the second business day following the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities (or at such other date and time as set forth in the Pricing Agreement) and from time to time thereafter, to furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, each as amended or supplemented, in New York City in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request, and, if the
 
delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Designated Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus, a supplement to the Prospectus or an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;
     (g) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Securities Act);
     (h) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including the later of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives, (ii) the last Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities and (iii) any period specified in the Pricing Agreement, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the Designated Securities without the prior written consent of the Representatives; and
     (i) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Securities Act.
     6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel, accountants and reserve engineers in connection with the registration of the Designated Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of

     7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
     (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to such Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;
     (b) Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Representatives such written opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, respectively, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture and the Designated Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus
 
as amended and supplemented, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, as well as such other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
     (c) Counsel for the Company, which shall be satisfactory to the Representatives, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, respectively, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
     (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus;
     (ii) The Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus, and all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
     (iii) This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (iv) The issue and sale by the Company of the Designated Securities being delivered at such Time of Delivery and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder and thereunder will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to us of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that would not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture or the Pricing Agreement or that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (except that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws with respect to this subparagraph);
     (v) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is
 
required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities being delivered at such Time of Delivery or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Indenture, this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act or the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters;
     (vi) The statements set forth in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus under the caption "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Designated Securities or the Indenture, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting," insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate in all material respects;
     (vii) The Designated Securities are in the form prescribed in or pursuant to the Indenture, have been duly and validly authorized by the Company by all necessary corporate action and, when executed and authenticated as specified in or pursuant to the Indenture and issued and delivered, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, and will be enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Designated Securities and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus and in the Prospectus as amended and supplemented; the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
     (viii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
     (ix) The Company is not an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
     (x) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements and the notes thereto and the related schedules or other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has
 
no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Securities Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact requiring to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
     (xi) the Designated Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in the case of the Underwriters' Securities, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, in each case enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
     (xii) The Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and the notes thereto and the related schedules or other information of a financial or reserve engineering nature therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of their respective effective or issue dates complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
     (xiii) Nothing has come to the attention of such counsel that causes such counsel to believe that (A) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1, as to which such counsel need not express any belief) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) the Time of Sale Prospectus (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which such counsel need not express any belief) as of the Time of Sale contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading or (C) the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which such counsel need not express any belief) as amended or supplemented, if applicable, as of its date or the applicable Time of Delivery contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to
 
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading.
     (d) C. William Austin, Legal Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, respectively, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that, other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and to such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
     (e) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company who have audited the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of such Pricing Agreement and the date of the most recent report filed with the Commission containing financial statements and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, if the date of such report is later than the date of such Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives; provided that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off date" not earlier than the date hereof;
     (f) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus, any loss or interference with the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus;
 
     (g) On or after the Time of Sale (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock or other preferred securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock or such other preferred security;
     (h) On or after the date of the Time of Sale there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State or Texas State authorities, or (iv) (A) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls, (B) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States, or (C) any attack on or outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international calamity or emergency, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, if any, or both on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market;
     (i) The Designated Securities at each Time of Delivery shall have been approved for listing, subject to notice of issuance, on any exchange or market listed in the Pricing Agreement;
     (j) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses and other documents on the second business day following the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities (or such other date as set forth in the Pricing Agreement);
     (k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and
     (l) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives, at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, a certificate of David F. Schaible, chief petroleum engineer and Executive Vice President  Operations
 
and Acquisitions of the Company, regarding the estimated proved reserves and future net cash flows from reserves data as presented in the Prospectus, in the form previously approved by the Representatives.
     8. Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to issue any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter without the consent of the Company.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim, and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in
 
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Designated Securities and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or any affiliates of such Underwriter who purchase Designated Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased is not 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased is 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting
 
Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or to such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. (a) The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
          (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities: (1) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person; (2) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any; and (3) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities.
     12. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the
 
Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or communication constituting such Questionnaire, or otherwise furnished to the Representatives, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

     (ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable, financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, financial forecasts and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been [separately] furnished to the representative or representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives", such term to include an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives) [and are attached thereto];
     (iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus and/or included in the company's reports incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus as indicated in their reports thereon copies of which [have been separately furnished to the Representatives] [are attached thereto]; and on the basis of specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
     (iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K

     (v) They have compared the information in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus under selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of items 301, 302, 402 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;

     (C) the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial
 
statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus and referred to in clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

     (E) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and

"Consolidated Coverage Ratio"
     (1)       if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has Incurred any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period that remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is an Incurrence of Indebtedness, or both, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof as if such Indebtedness had been Incurred on the first day of such period and such proceeds had been applied as of such date;
     (2)       if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period or if any Indebtedness is to be repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged on the date of the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis as if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period and as if the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary had not earned the interest income actually earned (if any) during such period in respect of cash or Temporary Cash Investments used to repay, repurchase, defease or otherwise discharge such Indebtedness;
     (3)       if, since the beginning of such period, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have made any Asset Disposition, then EBITDA for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to EBITDA (if positive) directly attributable to the assets which were the subject of such Asset Disposition for such period, or increased by an amount equal to EBITDA (if negative), directly attributable thereto for such period and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Interest Expense directly attributable to any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Company and its continuing Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such Asset Disposition for such period (or, if the Capital Stock of any
 
Restricted Subsidiary is sold, the Consolidated Interest Expense for such period directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary to the extent the Company and its continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness after such sale);
     (4)       if, since the beginning of such period, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) shall have made an Investment in any Restricted Subsidiary (or any Person which becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) or an acquisition of material assets, including any acquisition of assets occurring in connection with a transaction requiring a calculation to be made under the Indenture, which constitutes all or substantially all of an operating unit of a business, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such Investment or acquisition had occurred on the first day of such period; and
     (5)       if, since the beginning of such period, any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Asset Disposition, any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (3) or (4) above if made by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary during such period, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Asset Disposition, Investment or acquisition had occurred on the first day of such period.
     For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of assets, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any Indebtedness Incurred in connection therewith, the pro forma calculations shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting Officer. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness, but if the remaining term of such Interest Rate Agreement is less than 12 months, then such Interest Rate Agreement shall only be taken into account for that portion of the period equal to the remaining term thereof).
     The Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, the outstanding principal balance of which is required to be computed on a pro forma basis in accordance with the foregoing, shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period; provided, however, that such average daily balance shall take into account the amount of any repayment of Indebtedness under such revolving credit facility during the applicable period to the extent such repayment permanently reduced the commitments or amounts available to be borrowed under such facility.

     (8)       interest incurred in connection with Investments in discontinued operations;
     (9)       interest accruing on any Indebtedness of any other Person to the extent such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by (or secured by the assets of) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

     (3)       any net income of any Restricted Subsidiary if such Restricted Subsidiary is subject to restrictions, directly or indirectly, on the payment of dividends or the making of distributions by such Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to the Company, except that:

If the aggregate purchase price of 6% Notes and any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company shall select the 6% Notes and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the 6% Notes shall be denominations of $1,000 principal amount or multiples thereof. The Company shall not be required to make such an Offer to purchase 6% Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 1014 if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $20 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition).
     (c)       (1)      Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have its 6% Notes purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 1014(b) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount, at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall
 
contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision and all instructions and materials necessary to tender 6% Notes pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3).
     (2)       Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided above, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness included in the Offer, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 1014(a) and (b). On or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the 6% Notes or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the 6% Notes delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the 6% Notes, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period. Upon completion of an Offer, Net Available Cash shall be deemed to be reduced by the Offer Amount.
     (3)       Holders electing to have an 6% Notes purchased shall be required to surrender the 6% Note, with the form "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the 6% Notes which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such 6% Notes purchased. Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part shall be issued new 6% Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the 6% Notes surrendered.
     (4)       At the time the Company delivers 6% Notes to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such 6% Notes are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section. An 6% Note shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.
 
     (d)       The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of 6% Notes pursuant to this Section. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations.

     (4)       the instructions, as determined by the Company, consistent with this Section 1016, that a Holder must follow in order to have its 6% Notes purchased.
     In the event that at the time of a Change of Control the terms of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company (including the Revolving Credit Facility) restrict or prohibit the repurchase of 6% Notes following such Change of Control pursuant to this Section 1016, then prior to the mailing of such notice to Holders but in any event within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall (1) repay in full all such Senior Indebtedness or (2) obtain the requisite consents under the agreements governing such Senior Indebtedness to permit such repurchase of the 6% Notes.
     (c)       Holders electing to have an 6% Note purchased will be required to surrender the 6% Note, with the "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the purchase date.

either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs: (1) any Obligation on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the 6% Notes without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing.
     During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the 6% Notes for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee and the Company of a written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter.

     Notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company shall be permitted to resume payments on the 6% Notes after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The 6% Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period; provided, however, that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect.

Section
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
Reinstatement of Senior Indebtedness

holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
     To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of the Company as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred.
1406. .
Section
Subrogation
     After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the 6% Notes are paid in full, Noteholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Fourteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Noteholders is not, as between the Company and Noteholders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness.
1407. .
Section
Relative Rights
     This Article Fourteen defines the relative rights of Noteholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
     (1)       impair, as between the Company and Noteholders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the 6% Notes in accordance with their terms; or
     (2)       prevent the Trustee or any Noteholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Noteholders.
1408. .
Section
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
     No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as provided in this Indenture will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by noncompliance by the Company with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Senior Indebtedness may have or otherwise be charged with.
1409.
Section
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent; Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     Notwithstanding Section 1403, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the 6% Notes and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article Fourteen would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less
 
than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article Fourteen. The Company, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.

SECTION 10.
Subsidiary Guaranties.
     (a)       The Original Indenture is amended with respect to the 6% Notes by adding Articles Fifteen and Sixteen as follows:
1501. .
Section
Guaranties
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the 6% Notes when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the 6% Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the 6% Notes (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guarantied Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantied Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article Fifteen notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantied Obligation.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantied Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the 6% Notes or the Guarantied Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the 6% Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the 6% Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantied Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 1506, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of
 
collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guarantied Obligations.
     Each Subsidiary Guaranty is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in Article Sixteen, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor giving such Subsidiary Guaranty and each Subsidiary Guaranty is made subject to such provisions of this Indenture.
     Except as expressly set forth in Sections 1502 and 1506, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the 6% Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, except for the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guarantied Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
     In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guarantied Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guarantied Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guarantied Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantied Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guarantied Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in respect of any Guarantied Obligations until payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations and all obligations to which the Guarantied Obligations are subordinated as provided in Article Sixteen. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantied Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article Five for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's
 
Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guarantied Obligations as provided in Article Five, such Guarantied Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section.
1502. .
Section
Limitation on Liability
     Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
1503. .
Section
Successors and Assigns
     This Article Fifteen shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the 6% Notes shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
1504. .
Section
No Waiver
     Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article Fifteen shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article Fifteen at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
1505. .
Section
Modification
     No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article Fifteen, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
1506. .
Section
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor
 
     Upon (1) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) and as permitted by this Indenture, (2) the liquidation and dissolution of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (3) the exercise by the Company of its option (A) to satisfy and discharge the Indenture with respect to the 6% Notes pursuant to Article Four or (B) to effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance pursuant to Article Thirteen or (4) the designation of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Indenture and the 6% Notes without any further action required on the part of the Trustee, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
1507 .
Section
Contribution
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment under its Subsidiary Guaranty shall be entitled upon payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.
1601. .
Section
Agreement to Subordinate
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Noteholder by accepting an 6% Note agrees, that the payment of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty (including any amounts in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 6% Notes and any other payment obligation in respect of the 6% Notes, including any obligation of the Company to purchase 6% Notes) is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Sixteen, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and that the subordination is for the benefit of and shall be enforceable directly by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Guarantied Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall rank senior to the Guarantied Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article Sixteen shall be subject to Section 1612.
1602. .
Section
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor upon a liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property:
 
     (1)       holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of such Senior Indebtedness before Noteholders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and
     (2)       until the Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash or cash equivalents, any payment or distribution to which Noteholders would be entitled but for this Article Sixteen shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Noteholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as its Subsidiary Guaranty.
1603. .
Section
Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
     No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make any payment under its Subsidiary Guaranty, whether in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 6% Notes or any other payment obligation in respect of the 6% Notes (including any obligation of the Company to purchase 6% Notes) or make any deposit pursuant to Article Four or Thirteen and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any 6% Notes or other Guarantied Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; provided, however, that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing.
     During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor of written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents.
     Notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of
 
such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be permitted to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period; provided, however, that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect.
1604. .
Section
Demand for Payment
     If a demand for payment is made by the Trustee on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article Fifteen, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand.
1605. .
Section
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over; Reinstatement of Senior Indebtedness
     If a distribution is made to Noteholders that because of this Article Sixteen should not have been made to them, the Noteholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear.
     To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Guarantor as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred.
1606. .
Section
Subrogation
     After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the 6% Notes are paid in full, Noteholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article Sixteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Noteholders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Noteholders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.
1607. .
Section
Relative Rights
     This Article Sixteen defines the relative rights of Noteholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
 
     (1)       impair, as between a Subsidiary Guarantor and Noteholders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty to the extent set forth in Article Fifteen; or
     (2)       prevent the Trustee or any Noteholder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Noteholders.
1608. .
Section
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
     No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce subordination as provided in this Indenture will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by noncompliance by such Subsidiary Guarantor with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such Holder of Senior Indebtedness may have or otherwise be charged with.
1609.
Section
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent; Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     Notwithstanding Section 1603, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article Sixteen would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article Sixteen. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Sixteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.
     The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time subject to the terms of such Senior Indebtedness, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Noteholders, without incurring responsibility to the Noteholders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Indenture or the obligations hereunder of the Noteholders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following:
     (1)       change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding or secured;
 
     (2)       sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness;
     (3)       release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; and
     (4)       exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Subsidiary Guarantor and any other Person.
1610. .
Section
Distribution or Notice to Representative
     Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
1611. .
Section
Article Sixteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment
     The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article Sixteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall have any effect on the right of the Noteholders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
1612. .
Section
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from any money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article Four or Thirteen by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the 6% Notes shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Sixteen, and none of the Noteholders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to any Subsidiary Guarantor or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other creditor of any Subsidiary Guarantor.
1613. .

     Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 1602 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Sixteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the
 
Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Sixteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

1616. .
Section
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors on Subordination Provisions
     Each Noteholder by accepting an 6% Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the 6% Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

Attest:
________________________
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Date:
 
     1.       Indenture; Limitations.
     The Company issued the 6% Notes under the Subordinated Indenture dated as of December 10, 2001 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented and amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 3, 2006 (the Original Indenture as so supplemented and amended being hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated. The terms of the 6% Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The 6% Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this 6% Note and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall control.
     The 6% Notes are senior subordinated obligations of the Company and the aggregate principal amount of the 6% Notes which may be issued, executed, authenticated, delivered and outstanding is unlimited (subject to Section 1 of the Third Supplemental Indenture). The Company may, subject to Section 1010 of the Indenture, issue Additional 6% Notes under the Indenture in either a limited or an unlimited aggregate principal amount. This 6% Note is one of the Original 6% Notes referred to in the Indenture issued in an aggregate principal amount of $550,000,000. Any Additional 6% Notes may be issued as part of the same or a different series of Securities as the Original 6% Notes, but all such 6% Notes shall be treated as a single class under the Indenture.
     2.       Principal and Interest.
     The Company will pay the principal of this 6% Note on April 15, 2016.
     The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this 6% Note on each April 15 and October 15 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), as set forth below, at the rate per annum shown above.
     Interest will be payable semiannually (to the holders of record of the 6% Notes at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1 immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date) on each Interest Payment Date, commencing October 15, 2006.
 
     Interest on the 6% Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from April 3, 2006, provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest and this 6% Note is authenticated between a Regular Record Date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such Interest Payment Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the 6% Notes plus 1% per annum, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest, to the extent lawful, at the rate borne by the 6% Notes plus 1% per annum.
     3.       Method of Payment.
     The Company will pay interest (except Defaulted Interest) on the principal amount of the 6% Notes as provided above on each Interest Payment Date to the persons who are Holders (as reflected in the Security Register at the close of business on the April 1 and October 1 immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date), in each case, even if the 6% Note is canceled on registration of transfer, registration of exchange, redemption or repurchase after such record date and on or before the Interest Payment Date, provided that, with respect to the payment of principal, the Company will make payment to the Holder that surrenders this 6% Note to a Paying Agent on or after its Maturity.
     The Company will pay principal, premium, if any, and as provided above, interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The Company will make such payments (i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to any account maintained in the United States with respect to Global Securities or 6% Notes held in certificated form with an aggregate principal amount in excess of $1,000,000 whose Holder has requested such method of payment and provided wire transfer instructions to the Paying Agent or (ii) by check payable in such money mailed to a Holder's registered address with respect to any certificated 6% Notes. If a payment date is a date other than a Business Day at a Place of Payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.
     4.       Paying Agent and Security Registrar.
     Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar in relation to the 6% Notes. The Company may change any authenticating agent, Paying Agent or Security Registrar without notice.
 
     5.       Optional and Mandatory Redemption.
     The 6% Notes are subject to both optional and mandatory redemption, either as a whole or in some cases in part, at the times, under the circumstances, upon the giving of prior notices to Holders and at the Redemption Prices described in Article Eleven of the Indenture.
     6.       Subordination.
     The 6% Notes are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Indebtedness of the Company must be paid before the 6% Notes may be paid. The Company and each Holder by accepting a 6% Note agree to the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture and authorize the Trustee to give it effect and appoint the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
     7.       Repurchase upon a Change of Control.
     Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of 6% Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder's 6% Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 6% Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date).
     8.       Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
     The 6% Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register the transfer of or exchange 6% Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the transaction. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any 6% Notes selected or called for redemption (except in the case of a 6% Note redeemed in part, the portion of the 6% Note not to be redeemed). Also, it need not register the transfer or exchange of any 6% Notes for a period of 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of 6% Notes selected for redemption.
     9.       Persons Deemed Owners.
     A Holder shall be treated as the owner of a 6% Note for all purposes.
     10.       Unclaimed Money.
 
     If money for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its written request, unless an abandoned property law provides otherwise. After that, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment, and all liability of the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.
     11.       Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity.
     Subject to certain conditions, if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the then outstanding principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 6% Notes to redemption or Stated Maturity, as applicable, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, may terminate some of or all of their obligations under the Indenture and the 6% Notes, all as provided in Articles Four and Thirteen of the Indenture.
     12.       Amendment; Supplement; Waiver.
     Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the 6% Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the 6% Notes then Outstanding, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the 6% Notes then Outstanding. Without notice to or the consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the 6% Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency and make any other change that does not adversely affect the interests of any Holder in any material respect.
     13.       Restrictive Covenants.
     The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, among other things, to Incur additional Indebtedness, make Restricted Payments, use the proceeds from Asset Dispositions, suffer to exist restrictions on the ability of Restricted Subsidiaries to make certain payments to the Company, engage in transactions with Affiliates, suffer to exist or incur Liens, Incur layered Indebtedness or merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of their assets. The Company is also required to cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries that Guarantees or secures other Indebtedness of the Company to, at the same time, Guarantee payment of the 6% Notes on the terms provided in Article Fifteen of the Indenture. Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating whether or not the signers know of any Default or Event of Default under such restrictive covenants.
     14.       Successor Persons.
 
     Subject to certain exceptions, when a successor Person assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the 6% Notes and the Indenture, the predecessor Person will be released from those obligations.
     15.       Defaults and Remedies.

     (e)       a default by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount greater than $10.0 million (other than Non-recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) that results in acceleration of the maturity of such Indebtedness, or failure to pay any such Indebtedness at maturity within any applicable grace period, if such Indebtedness is not repaid or such acceleration is not rescinded within 10 days beyond the applicable grace period or the acceleration as provided in the Indenture;
     (f)       one or more judgments or decrees by a court of competent jurisdiction are entered against the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary in an uninsured or unindemnified aggregate amount outstanding at any time in excess of $10.0 million and such judgments or decrees are not discharged, waived, stayed, satisfied or bonded for a period of 60 consecutive days;

     The Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (g) above) with respect to the 6% Notes at the time Outstanding shall occur and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 6% Notes by notice as provided in the Indenture may declare the principal amount of the 6% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (g) above with respect to the 6% Notes at the time Outstanding shall occur, the principal amount of all the 6% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will , and without any action by the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 6% Notes may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture.

Newfield Exploration Company 363 N. Sam Houston Parkway E. Suite 2020 Houston, Texas 77060
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We acted as counsel for Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the prospectus supplement dated March 29, 2006 to the prospectus dated April 26, 2005, with respect to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-124120) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the issuance and sale of $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"), to be issued under a Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 10, 2001 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly known as First Union National Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and a Third Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of April 3, 2006, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture"). The Notes are being offered, issued and sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement and a pricing agreement (collectively, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters of such offering.
     In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined or are familiar with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date, and have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of the Indenture, the form of Supplemental Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and corporate records of the Company, including minute books of the Company as furnished to us by the Company, certificates of representatives of the Company, and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained in such certificates. In making our examination, we have assumed that all signatures on documents examined by us are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and that all documents submitted to us as copies conform to the originals of such documents.
     On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes, when duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture and upon payment of the consideration therefor as provided for in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in

accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof is subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company and to the incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Very truly yours, /s/ King & Spalding LLP
